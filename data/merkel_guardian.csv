https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream;2022-06-02;NA;"Germany has been forced to admit it was a terrible mistake to become so dependent on Russian oil and gas. So why did it happen?
On Sunday 1 February 1970, senior politicians and gas executives from Germany and the Soviet Union gathered at the upmarket Hotel Kaiserhof in Essen. They were there to celebrate the signing of a contract for the first major Russia-Germany gas pipeline, which was to run from Siberia to the West German border at Marktredwitz in Bavaria. The contract was the result of nine months of intense bargaining over the price of the gas, the cost of 1.2m tonnes of German pipes to be sold to Russia, and the credit terms offered to Moscow by a consortium of 17 German banks. Aware of the risk of Russia defaulting, the German banks’ chief financial negotiator, Friedrich Wilhelm Christians, took the precaution of asking for a loan from the federal government, explaining: “I don’t do any somersaults without a net, especially not on a trapeze.”
The relationship would benefit both sides: Germany would supply the machines and high-quality industrial goods; Russia would provide the raw material to fuel German industry. High-pressure pipelines and their supporting infrastructure hold the potential to bind countries together, since they require trust, cooperation and mutual dependence. But this was not just a commercial deal, as the presence at the hotel of the German economic minister Karl Schiller showed. For the advocates of Ostpolitik – the new “eastern policy” of rapprochement towards the Soviet Union and its allies including East Germany, launched the previous year under chancellor Willy Brandt – this was a moment of supreme political consequence. Schiller, an economist by training, was to describe it as part of an effort at “political and human normalisation with our Eastern neighbours”.
The sentiment was laudable, but for some observers it was a potentially dangerous move. Before the signing, Nato had discreetly written to the German economics ministry to inquire about the security implications. Norbert Plesser, head of the gas department at the ministry, had assured Nato that there was no cause for alarm: Germany would never rely on Russia for even 10% of its gas supplies.
Half a century later, in 2020, Russia would supply more than half of Germany’s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories and fuel vehicles. Roughly half of Germany’s coal imports, which are essential to its steel manufacturing, came from Russia.
An arrangement that began as a peacetime opening to a former foe has turned into an instrument of aggression. Germany is now funding Russia’s war. In the first two months after the start of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Germany is estimated to have paid nearly €8.3bn for Russian energy – money used by Moscow to prop up the rouble and buy the artillery shells firing at Ukrainian positions in Donetsk. In that time, EU countries are estimated to have paid a total of €39bn for Russian energy, more than double the sum they have given to help Ukraine defend itself. The irony is painful. “For thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism,” the historian Timothy Snyder wrote recently. “When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it.”
When Putin invaded Ukraine in February, Germany faced a particular problem. Its rejection of nuclear power and its transition away from coal meant that Germany had very few alternatives to Russian gas. Berlin has been forced to accept that it was a cataclysmic error to have made itself so dependent on Russian energy – whatever the motives behind it. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, says Germany failed to listen to the warnings from countries that had once suffered under Russia’s occupation, such as Poland and the Baltic states. For Norbert Röttgen, a former environment minister and member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU), the German government bowed to industry forces pressing for cheap gas “all too easily”, while “completely ignoring the geopolitical risks”.
In February this year, German Green economic affairs and climate action minister Robert Habeck said that gas storage facilities owned by Gazprom in Germany had been “systematically emptied” over the winter, to drive up prices and exert political pressure. It was a staggering admission of Russia’s power to disrupt energy supplies.
“I was wrong,” the former German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says, simply. “We were all wrong.”
In recent weeks even Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, a totemic figure of the Social Democrats and greatest German advocate of the trade “bridge” between east and west, has recanted. He admits he misread Russia’s intentions as he pursued the construction of a new undersea gas pipeline. “My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,” he told German media in April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and that our partners warned us about.” This is an extraordinary admission for a man who acted as chief of staff to Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democratic chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and thereafter a lavishly rewarded, and much reviled, lobbyist for Vladimir Putin. Steinmeier was also foreign minister under Chancellor Merkel, and a great evangelist for Wandel durch Handel, the concept that trade and dialogue can bring about social and political change.
How did Germany end up making such a blunder? Some argue that Merkel should have seen that Putin was taking Russia in an authoritarian direction when he announced his return to the presidency in 2011. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Germany made no move to stop importing Russian gas, and although Merkel threatened to introduce crippling trade sanctions, German industry convinced her to hold back. But some blame a more persistent misjudgment stretching back 50 years, based on a fallacy that authoritarian countries can be transformed through trade.
The Social Democrats have now set up a review into whether the policy of Ostpolitik – first laid out in a landmark speech in July 1963 by Egon Bahr, then the closest adviser to West Berlin’s mayor and chancellor-to-be, Willy Brandt – became deformed over time, especially after securing its great achievement, the fall of the Berlin Wall.
What is extraordinary, retracing the history through memoirs and contemporary records, is how frequently and determinedly Germany was warned, by everyone from Henry Kissinger onwards, that it was making a pact it might live to regret. Kissinger wrote to Richard Nixon on 9 April 1970: “Few people, either inside Germany or abroad, see Brandt as selling out to the East; what worries people is whether he can control what he has started.” Over 50 years, Germany fought numerous battles with a series of US presidents over its growing dependence on Russian energy. In the process, Germany’s foreign office developed a view of American anti-communism as naive, and a belief that only Germany truly understood the Soviet Union.
From the late 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany tried to open its own direct line of communication with the Soviet leadership, even though its interest in reunification created tensions with the US. When it faced criticism from the US, Germany was wont to cite its unique status. “I cannot imagine there is anyone more interested in being allowed to continue working for detente and balance in Europe than the German people who are forced to live in two states,” Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then the foreign minister, told the German Bundestag in January 1980, to great applause.
But after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, why was Germany still so reluctant to listen to others? A sense of guilt for the atrocities committed against the Soviet Union during the second world war may have played a role. Pride, too, that – through Ostpolitik – it had mended its relations with Moscow. Germany, in a sense, became a double prisoner of its past – bound both to the horrors it had committed, and to its belief that its response to those horrors was correct.
The conflicts between Germany and the US in the 70s and 80s, involving two very different presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, were some of the most rancorous transatlantic battles since the second world war. “The disputes were all part of West Germany showing independence in foreign policy during the cold war, and that became uncomfortable for some American leaders,” the historian Mary Elise Sarotte said to me.
Carter and the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had little respect for each other. Carter found Schmidt moody, while the chancellor, in his autobiography, dismissed Carter as an idealistic preacher, who knew nothing of Europe and was “just not big enough for the game”. The two leaders did not just grate personally, they disagreed on issues of substance – including how to protect human rights in Russia. In 1979 Schmidt and Carter came together to jointly adopt the so-called dual track decision, by which Nato would upgrade its nuclear weapons based in Europe, while actively seeking an arms control agreement with Russia. But in other ways their approach was very different.
Schmidt never lacked self-confidence, but like many Germans of that era he carried a deep sense of shame arising from painful war memories. He also believed that the stability of the eastern bloc was in the interest of West Germany, given Russia’s nuclear capability. In his autobiography he wrote that he had wanted to develop trading relations with Russia, in order to foster “a greater Soviet dependence upon European supplies”, in turn leading to “more European influence” on Moscow’s policies. And following the 1973 oil crisis, Schmidt became convinced that the Soviet Union represented a more reliable supplier of energy for Germany than the Gulf states.
Carter, by contrast, saw withholding trade as the better way to influence the Soviets. In July 1978, responding to Moscow’s imprisonment of two Soviet dissidents, Aleksandr Ginzburg and Anatoly Shcharansky, Carter restricted US exports of technology for the exploration and development of the Soviet oil and natural-gas industries.
Yet, collectively, European business went in the opposite direction. Even after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, a large German business delegation went ahead with a visit to Moscow. The Soviets (Soyuzgazexport) and western Europeans (chiefly Ruhrgas and Gaz de France) completed negotiations on a new giant gas project, a 4,500km dedicated pipeline from the giant Urengoy field in West Siberia in late 1980. This deal was projected to increase Germany’s dependence on Russian gas from 15% to 30%. When German ministers reviewed the security implications, they concluded there was no danger of Russia misusing its potential stranglehold. Their reasoning was simple. “Long-term disruption would be against the self-interest of the Soviet Union,” the ministry decided.
In a phone call with Carter on 5 March, Schmidt explained his support for the pipeline by telling the US president, “Those engaging in trade with each other do not shoot at one another.” It was a restatement of Norman Angell’s famous pre-first world war theory that the new interdependence of economies made war unprofitable and thus irrational. According to a note in his diary, Carter responded: “It is not beneficial for the Europeans to expect us to provide the stick and for them to compete with one another about providing the biggest carrot.”
In 1980, Schmidt wrote: “To speak of the Federal Republic’s economic dependence on Moscow to a degree large enough to affect foreign policy indicates ignorance or malice.” Given Germany’s plight now, those words look hopelessly misjudged.
Schmidt faced a more challenging opponent in Carter’s successor, the traditional anti-communist Ronald Reagan. In Reagan’s eyes, German trade with Russia was in direct conflict with western security. Reagan’s view was informed by a CIA assessment submitted in July 1981, which noted a clear trend: from 1970 to 1980, Soviet gas exports to western Europe had risen from 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year to 26.5bcm annually. The CIA warned Reagan that the Urengoy gas project would not only accelerate Soviet economic growth, but provide the Soviets with $8bn in hard currency, facilitating a further military buildup. Far from giving Germany sway over Soviet thinking, “it would provide the Soviets one additional pressure point they could use as part of a broader diplomatic offensive to persuade the West Europeans to accept their viewpoint on East-West issues”.
In arguments that echo today’s debates, the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, complained: “We consistently find in our talks the allies are already significantly dependent: France for 15% [of its] gas, Germany for 30%.” Schmidt assured the Americans that Germany “can go six months in the event of a Soviet cut-off”. The forecast now is that, in such an eventuality, Germany would have to go straight to a form of energy rationing.
Despite various US efforts to persuade Europe to adopt a voluntary ban, including offering alternative sources of energy, in 1981 Ruhrgas AG and Soyusgazexport went ahead and signed a contract for annual imports of 10.5bcm of Soviet gas over a 25-year period. Unemployment in Europe was close to 9% at the time, and European industry needed to boost its energy supplies. At the same time, the US argument about security was dismissed as a veiled way of promoting the US oil industry.
When Moscow backed the imposition of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981, Reagan thought such a shocking event might persuade Germany to put the pipeline on hold. In a private note to Margaret Thatcher, sent on 19 December 1981, he urged her to back tough sanctions against the Soviets, stating that “this may well be a watershed in the history of mankind. A challenge to tyranny from within.” Unusually for her, Thatcher vacillated, advising Reagan that the Germans “cannot and will not give up the gas pipeline project”.
The US responded to the Soviet intervention by banning US companies from helping with the pipeline. In the summer of 1982 Reagan tried to force European firms to stop working on the pipeline by imposing secondary sanctions on them. Such sanctions are now a commonplace in the US foreign policy armoury, particularly over Iran, but then, they were seen as an incursion into European sovereignty. Thatcher bridled, telling the Commons “it is wrong” for “one very powerful nation [to] prevent existing contracts being fulfilled”.
By November, Reagan had abandoned the attempt to impose sanctions. In a trial of strength in which Europe sided with Germany, the world’s superpower had lost. The new pipeline started pumping on 1 January 1984.
The German advocates of change through trade had won. The US position on Russia was further weakened when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The peaceful collapse of communism was trumpeted as a vindication for those that had championed dialogue, and engagement through trade. In a speech to the Brandt Foundation in March 2008, Steinmeier gave full vent to this view: “What Ostpolitik in fact achieved – as is now recognised also by those who criticised it at the time,” he said, “was to make peace in Europe, despite the difficulties, a degree more secure. For the democracy movements in eastern Europe it created new possibilities, new scope for action. It was a key factor, too, in finally ending the confrontation between the two blocs.”
Olaf Scholz, Germany’s current chancellor, remains an adherent of this view, arguing last year that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and laid the basis for democracy and EU membership for much of eastern Europe. The SPD co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, has also insisted that Ostpolitik “was the basis for reunification and the end of the cold war. As a result, there has been a consensus in the federal republic for decades that conflicts can be defused through dialogue. We won’t let that be bad-mouthed.”
Yet a number of historians and writers believe that this rosy picture of Ostpolitik is misleading. “The idea that Willy Brandt’s policy of detente towards Moscow led in a straight line to the fall of the iron curtain and German unity is at least an over-simplification,” says the historian Jan Behrends. German journalist Thomas Urban, author of a new book critiquing Ostpolitik, believes its role in the fall of the wall and German reunification has been exaggerated: “It was military buildup by Reagan and the flooding of the market with cheap oil that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he told me. The Russian government budget had grown so dependent on energy for its revenue, he said, that when the price of oil plummeted in the mid-1980s, Russia’s lifeline to external capital dried up. “Gorbachev could no longer fund the overseas wars and the Soviet Republics,” he said. “But this argument was entirely missing in the German debate, especially on the left.”
Urban argued that Ostpolitik’s theory of change suffered from two basic misconceptions: the belief that political change in eastern Europe could only come from engaging with the elite in power, rather than from civilian movements, and second, that “security must be the key to everything”.
By the turn of the century, the advocates of change through trade were in their pomp. Chancellor Schröder, with growing confidence, promoted the idea of a strategic partnership with Russia. He invited the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to address the Bundestag in 2001, where he won over his audience by giving the speech in fluent German and declaring “the cold war is over”.
Schröder, at the time of Putin’s address, saw a perfect confluence of interests between Europe, Germany and Russia: peace, stability, multilateralism and economic growth. Putin, Schröder was convinced, “wants to transform Russia into a democracy”.
In this favourable political climate, pro-Russian German lobbyists such as Klaus Mangold, chairman of the powerful German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, pursued the construction of yet another gas pipeline, this time taking gas from Vyborg under the Baltic Sea to Germany – the first Nord Stream. The scheme was especially controversial since it would bypass Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, reducing those countries’ incomes, weakening their bargaining power and depriving them of badly needed transit fees. The €7.4bn pipeline construction costs were to be borne by the private German companies BASF and E.ON, and the majority Russian state-owned Gazprom.
This time, protests against the pipeline did not just come from the US, but from the states that had recently emerged from Soviet rule, such as Poland and Lithuania. Radosław Sikorski, then Poland’s defence minister, notoriously compared the plan to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which paved the way for the invasion of Poland.
Yet on 8 September 2005, 10 days before the election in which Schröder’s Social Democrats lost to Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the Nord Stream 1 contract was signed in Berlin by representatives of Gazprom, E.ON and BASF. Putin stood alongside Schröder at the signing ceremony.
Schröder has since been singled out for his role in creating Germany’s dependence on Russian energy, and getting very rich in the process. But the distinguished former German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger recently argued that Schröder should not take the blame for giving the go-ahead to Nord Stream 20 years ago: most German politicians, he told the New York Times in April, did not question whether they were getting into an unhealthy dependence on Russian energy. In the article, Schröder made the same case: “It never occurred to anyone that this could become a problem. It was just a way of procuring gas for Germans, for Germany’s heavy industry, and also for the chemical industry, with fewer problems and disruptions.”
Thereafter it seemed, whatever the setbacks in German-Russian relations, nothing could shift the faith in trade – not Russia’s “peace enforcement operation” in Georgia in August 2008, not the Russian disruption of the gas pipelines in a dispute with Ukraine in January 2009, nor the news that Putin was planning to return to the presidency in 2012, replacing Dmitry Medvedev, in whom Frank-Walter Steinmeier had placed his faith. In 2011, the year Nord Stream finally opened, German total trade exports to Russia rose 34% to €27bn.
Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2014. Initially, Russia’s incursion seemed to mark a turning point. Merkel’s condemnation was clear: the annexation of Crimea was contrary to international law. Sanctions were duly imposed, and German exports to Russia fell.
Following the 2014 invasion, serious German media such as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published lengthy articles looking at the options for how Germany could wean itself off its dangerous dependency on Russian energy. Many of the proposals, such as new liquid gas terminals to allow Germany to import gas from other countries such as Qatar and the US, are the same ones under discussion now, which shows how little actual diversification was achieved. When I spoke to a Qatari energy official last month, he recounted how they spent five years trying to break into the German energy market, only to find their route blocked at every turn.
Some German sanctions on Russia continued for many years, but the advocates of change through trade gradually re-established their ground. It seemed nothing Russia could do would shake their confidence. On 4 September 2015, at the Vladivostok economic forum, with Putin in attendance, an agreement was signed for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed, which would vastly increase Germany’s reliance on Russian natural gas. Gazprom would also take over Germany’s gas storage business, thereby handing control of German energy reserves to a foreign power.
Various theories – some grubby, some metaphysical – have been proposed to explain Germany’s dogged refusal to see the dangers in its dependency on Russia. One argument places the blame on SPD politicians and civil servants who were allowed to move seamlessly between public office and Putin’s employment, and worked hard to manipulate the EU and German regulatory environment to suit Gazprom.
Then there is the question of the German-Russian industrial lobby, as symbolised by the German-Russian Forum, which was closely linked with, and partly funded by, German companies active in Russia. (The Forum was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine.) Its board of trustees consisted mainly of business people, often with economic interests in Russia. Its chairman, Matthias Platzeck, the former SPD minister president of Brandenburg, seemed genuinely shocked by Putin’s invasion: “I was wrong because until recently I thought what happened was unthinkable.”
The historian Sarotte said there is no clear evidence that business had exerted greater influence in politics in Germany than in other countries. Nevertheless, over the years, Russia showed an ability to suborn, and in some cases corrupt, the German political class. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, on a visit to Berlin in late May, called German Ostpolitik a “fiasco”. German rhetoric around the political value of interdependence, he said, crudely boiled down to gaining a competitive advantage through cheap energy.
Thomas Urban, examining the psychological roots of Ostpolitik, pinpoints two emotions in Germany’s relationship with Russia: nostalgia and guilt. He described to me “the memory of Bismarck, who saw the alliance with Russia as an anchor of stability in Europe. But then there was also the feeling of guilt because of the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, with millions of dead. It meant it was difficult to criticise the Red Army or the Soviet repression since to do so means you do not recognise the greatest crimes in history. It makes Germany blind to the black side of the Soviet Union. It also permits Putin’s propaganda by talking only of the Russian war dead, and not those that were killed in Ukraine and Belarus.”
Much of Germany’s belief in trade with Russia was born of wishful thinking. It led Steinmeier as foreign minister, for instance, to look constantly for signs of reform, ignoring foreign office advice that he needed a plan B in case Germany’s faith in Russia turned out to be ill-founded. In 2016, Steinmeier gave a deeply sincere, almost elegiac speech at Yekaterinburg University asking whether Germany and Russia were still capable of listening to one another. He admitted the annexation of Crimea had been a low point, but hoped dialogue was still possible, urging both sides not to turn their backs on one another.
It was the speech of a man who sensed the tide was going out, and who feared his belief in dialogue no longer matched the spirit of harsher times: “In political discussions, we sometimes hear opinions expressed by people who are not interested in the slightest in understanding others; people who have already made up their minds about the other side; people who don’t even bother reading because they think they already know the answer.” What he described as the “supposed antagonism” between the west and Russia, he feared was becoming entrenched and ideologically driven, running counter to the pursuit of diplomacy and peace.
Now, as Germany’s president and head of state, Steinmeier has been told by Ukrainian officials that his record as the promoter of Russian interests in Germany means he is not welcome in Kyiv at this time. It seems a shame. There would be no need for him to fall to his knees – as Willy Brandt did in Warsaw in 1970, apologising for his nation’s wartime crimes – but he could give a sober reflection on what precisely went wrong with Germany’s eastern policy for so long. For, one way or another, a reckoning is still needed.
This article was amended on 2 and 3 June 2022 to make clear that when Egon Bahr was adviser to Willy Brandt in 1963, the latter was yet to become chancellor; and that officials at the 1970 Essen meeting were representing the Soviet Union rather than Russia.

The leaked contents of a WhatsApp chat group associated with Germany’s far-right AfD has offered an unfiltered glimpse into party discussions, including fantasies over the imprisonment of Angela Merkel, homophobic attacks and armed resistance.
Called the Quasselgruppe, or “yakking group”, the chat contains conversations between 76 of the 92 Alternative für Deutschland MPs who entered parliament in 2017 for the first time after the federal election.
It contains about 40,000 posts sent from 2017 to 2021 and was passed on by an anonymous AfD member last summer to journalists from the broadcasters NDR and WDR who were making a documentary about the party.
The discussions focus on topics including the US presidential election, the pandemic and how the aggressively nationalistic AfD should position itself with regards to the Querdenker movement, a coronavirus denial group.
It also touches on other events that deeply shocked the political world in Germany, such as the storming of the Reichstag building in September 2020 by demonstrators protesting against coronavirus safety measures who were assisted by AfD members, and the constitutional crisis, also in 2020, triggered by the collaboration between the AfD and the CDU that enabled the election of a state premier in Thuringia.
Also discussed are the homophobic attacks on the former health minister Jens Spahn, and the SPD MP Johannes Kahrs.
There are calls for regime change, reflecting some of the language widely heard among anti-Merkel street protests in some parts of eastern Germany, with one calling for the “old regime” to be brought to an end, predicting a “ruthless battle” for which it would be necessary to arm.
On Merkel, then chancellor, one post read: “This traitor deserves to be sent to prison until the end of her life.”
Indications of internal party disagreements are rife. There is criticism about the party leadership’s failure to not have “pulled the plug” sooner on its radical wing, known as “der Flügel” or wing, due largely to the bad publicity it brought.
Parliamentary leaders Alice Weidel, Alexander Gauland and Tino Chrupulla are accused repeatedly in the chat of having weak strategies and of failing to boost the party’s profile.
There is also much disgruntlement over the AfD’s failure to make its mark in parliament, with some MPs referring to their own parliamentary faction as a “chaos outfit”.
Weidel was reported to have lost her temper at a meeting of parliamentary colleagues when news of the leaks came to light, asking them how it was that the internal communications had been made public. She told the makers of the documentary that she had not been part of the group, that she distanced herself from the remarks and had become accustomed to calls to oust her.
After the party was made aware of the leak, internal discussions led the party to switch to communicating on Telegram instead.
The AfD, which was founded in 2013, entered the Bundestag for the first time in September 2017."

For undecided French voters tempted to back the far-right populist Marine Le Pen in next Sunday’s presidential election, the situation resembles a midlife crisis. They’re fed up with the same old, same old – the boss is a pain and the bills keep on rising. How great it would be to throw it all up, escape the system, buy a smallholding somewhere and grow veg.
In the end, most people decide against so drastic a break with all that is familiar and secure, however unsatisfactory their present circumstances. That’s what France’s friends and neighbours must hope will happen when Le Pen faces the centrist incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, in the second round run-off. Macron, though unpopular, represents continuity. Le Pen is the candidate of chaos.
Just how truly anarchic a Le Pen presidency could be was laid bare last week when the candidate for the National Rally (formerly the National Front) outlined her “vision” of France’s place in the world. Like Donald Trump in 2016, Le Pen’s stress is on tearing down, not building up. She knows what she doesn’t like. But she’s recklessly vague about what replaces that she would destroy.
The EU is a particular target. Contradicting past positions, Le Pen no longer wants to leave the EU or the eurozone. But her proposed referendum on a new “France-first” law giving French citizens priority in employment, welfare benefits and public housing, and asserting the primacy of national over European law, amounts to “Frexit” by any other name.
Le Pen’s plans to curb immigration by re-establishing national border controls, unilaterally cut EU budget contributions and slash taxes on essential goods and fuel also breach France’s legal obligations. Such policies risk a deeply existential crisis within the EU, of which France, along with Germany, is a founding member.
Franco-German cooperation, the fabled “motor” that keeps Europe running, would splutter to a halt if Le Pen has her way. Pointing to “irreconcilable strategic differences”, she rejected the “discreet and clever hegemony” pursued by Angela Merkel. Germany’s former chancellor, she claimed, had tried to subvert French sovereignty, weaken its identity and undercut its defence and nuclear industries.
Attempting a grotesque balancing act, Le Pen said she would seek “strategic rapprochement” with Russia, her party’s former backer, once the Ukraine war was over and distance France from the US by withdrawing from Nato’s military command. At the same time, she scorned Macron’s ideas about European defence autonomy. A “non-aligned” France, she said, would go its own way, pursuing the global “grandeur” that was its historical mission.
Were she to gain power, Le Pen’s geopolitical wrecking ball would be disastrous for Britain and the west. The democratic majority among UN security council permanent members would be in doubt. With France on board, rightwing nationalist-populists in Italy, Poland, Hungary and elsewhere would be encouraged to press their divisive, xenophobic, pan-European agendas.
The struggle for western values in the teeth of Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, and for the international rules-based order, could be forfeited. Cooperative efforts to combat the climate crisis might founder. At home, intolerance, racism and institutionalised Islamophobia would reign… the nightmare possibilities are endless. Yet now, as Sunday’s sudden death showdown looms, they are coming into much-needed, sharper focus.
It is no longer possible to ignore or minimise the truly destructive horror of Le Pen’s twisted idea of France. Surely this will concentrate wavering and disaffected voters’ minds – and arouse them at last from iconoclastic daydreams. Polls suggest Macron is eight points ahead. But it’s tense. As Wellington said after Waterloo, it could yet be “the nearest-run thing you ever saw”."

The German chancellor has the chance to provide it
Not long ago, Brexit Britain was the bad boy of Europe. Then it was Poland’s turn, its rightwing leadership likewise excoriated for defying the Brussels establishment. Now, after the invasion of Ukraine, it’s Germany that’s getting all the stick. Some of this criticism is deserved. Some of it resurrects ugly stereotypes and old prejudices harking back to the Nazi era.
Olaf Scholz’s government is under increasingly fierce pressure to halt gas and oil imports that help fuel Vladimir Putin’s war machine – and stop blocking tougher EU sanctions on Moscow’s fossil fuels. When Germany’s chancellor visited Downing Street on Friday, Boris Johnson urged him to break Berlin’s and Europe’s “embarrassing” €1bn-a-day Russian energy habit.
Brexit’s chief clown and Brussels-baiter has not been forgiven by the EU, and probably never will be, but Scholz’s visit showed how Ukraine has radically altered perspectives. The crisis has reminded even jingoistic Brexiters that core UK interests are inseparable from Europe’s. And Germany, despite everything, still values the British alliance. So Johnson minded his p’s and q’s.
Not so Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who accuses Scholz of placing German self-interest above Ukraine’s suffering. “It is not the voice of German businessmen or of German billionaires which should be heard in Berlin today. It is the voice of all the innocent women and children, the voice of the murdered people who should be heard,” Morawiecki said last week.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, frequently draws parallels with the second world war. Addressing the Bundestag last month, he accused Germany of failing to fulfil its post-Holocaust responsibility to ensure such horrors did not reoccur – and of past appeasement of Russia through economic engagement at the expense of democratic rights.
“Every year, politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing. In Europe, a people is being destroyed,” Zelenskiy said. In further remarks after Russian atrocities in the town of Bucha were uncovered, he took aim at Angela Merkel, Scholz’s predecessor, and France’s former president, Nicolas Sarkozy: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.”
Incoming flak is not confined to the eastern flank. “We cannot continue financing the Putin system that is waging this horrible war,” Manfred Weber, head of the European People’s party in the European parliament, told Politico. In a symbolic vote reflecting fury at Moscow, the parliament voted on Thursday for a “total and immediate” embargo on Russian energy imports.
Studies suggest Germany could more easily manage without Russian oil and gas than Scholz seems to think, and opinion polls show growing domestic support for tougher measures, despite the pain they would cause. Scholz’s stance is also coming under friendly fire. Having previously followed Berlin’s line, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, who is fighting for his political life in Sunday elections, now backs an embargo.
“What just happened in Bucha requires a new set of sanctions,” Macron said. “I want us to be able to act.” France, he added, would “coordinate with our European partners, especially Germany”. In the event, Germany, backed by Hungary and Austria, again blocked expedited EU oil (and gas) sanctions. Maybe Macron, with an eye on voters, expected this – and was content for Germany to be cast as the villain.
It’s true that Scholz was slow to appreciate the risk posed by Putin’s pre-war build-up. He refused, in line with past policy, now reversed, to supply weapons to Kyiv. It’s true, too, that after the invasion began, he moved swiftly to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, announced an unprecedented increase in defence spending, and backed initial EU and US sanctions.
Yet in recent weeks, it’s also plain that Germany, which depends on Russia for 55% of its gas and 34% of it oil, has been dragging its feet. A report in Die Welt meanwhile suggested that even previously agreed sanctions were not being effectively implemented by Berlin.
Claims by those who nurture old enmities and present grudges that Germany cares more about money than mass murder are deeply unfair. But Ukraine has delivered a shocking blow to the system, giving Germans a sense, perhaps, of how Greeks felt following the 2009 debt crisis.
First, a successful industrial policy based on cheap energy has gone up in smoke almost overnight.
Second, a foreign policy predicated on a belief that peaceful relations can be secured through mutually beneficial commerce now lies in ruins, along with the reputation of its chief advocate, Angela Merkel. Putin’s actions are not based on rational assessments of Russia’s best interests. Rather, they are essentially delusional, ideological and nationalistic.
Germany’s post-Ukraine relationship with China, another aggressive, ideologically driven authoritarian regime and major trading partner, is now subject to similar revision.
Third, its response to Ukraine has raised a big question mark over German leadership in Europe. The EU is clearly split along east-west lines, with Poland, the Baltic republics and normally quiescent people such as the Czechs demanding a much tougher response to Russia. This rift could become permanent.
At this dangerous juncture, western and northern EU states that traditionally look to Berlin for a lead look in vain. Yet Europe, from long experience, knows it cannot wholly rely on the French. Italy, Spain and the rest are largely bystanders. And Johnson’s Britain is trapped in a foolish fantasy of singular self-importance. If Scholz made a stand on energy, most would follow.

Not long ago, Brexit Britain was the bad boy of Europe. Then it was Poland’s turn, its rightwing leadership likewise excoriated for defying the Brussels establishment. Now, after the invasion of Ukraine, it’s Germany that’s getting all the stick. Some of this criticism is deserved. Some of it resurrects ugly stereotypes and old prejudices harking back to the Nazi era.
Olaf Scholz’s government is under increasingly fierce pressure to halt gas and oil imports that help fuel Vladimir Putin’s war machine – and stop blocking tougher EU sanctions on Moscow’s fossil fuels. When Germany’s chancellor visited Downing Street on Friday, Boris Johnson urged him to break Berlin’s and Europe’s “embarrassing” €1bn-a-day Russian energy habit.
Brexit’s chief clown and Brussels-baiter has not been forgiven by the EU, and probably never will be, but Scholz’s visit showed how Ukraine has radically altered perspectives. The crisis has reminded even jingoistic Brexiters that core UK interests are inseparable from Europe’s. And Germany, despite everything, still values the British alliance. So Johnson minded his p’s and q’s.
Not so Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who accuses Scholz of placing German self-interest above Ukraine’s suffering. “It is not the voice of German businessmen or of German billionaires which should be heard in Berlin today. It is the voice of all the innocent women and children, the voice of the murdered people who should be heard,” Morawiecki said last week.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, frequently draws parallels with the second world war. Addressing the Bundestag last month, he accused Germany of failing to fulfil its post-Holocaust responsibility to ensure such horrors did not reoccur – and of past appeasement of Russia through economic engagement at the expense of democratic rights.
“Every year, politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing. In Europe, a people is being destroyed,” Zelenskiy said. In further remarks after Russian atrocities in the town of Bucha were uncovered, he took aim at Angela Merkel, Scholz’s predecessor, and France’s former president, Nicolas Sarkozy: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.”
Incoming flak is not confined to the eastern flank. “We cannot continue financing the Putin system that is waging this horrible war,” Manfred Weber, head of the European People’s party in the European parliament, told Politico. In a symbolic vote reflecting fury at Moscow, the parliament voted on Thursday for a “total and immediate” embargo on Russian energy imports.
Studies suggest Germany could more easily manage without Russian oil and gas than Scholz seems to think, and opinion polls show growing domestic support for tougher measures, despite the pain they would cause. Scholz’s stance is also coming under friendly fire. Having previously followed Berlin’s line, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, who is fighting for his political life in Sunday elections, now backs an embargo.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/germany-angela-merkel-power-to-vladimir-putin-russia;2022-03-05;Germany agonises over Merkel’s legacy: did she hand too much power to Putin?;"The war in Ukraine has prompted criticism of former chancellor’s decisions on Nord Stream pipeline and Russia
After the war in Ukraine led German chancellor Olaf Scholz to pivot dramatically last week on his country’s postwar creeds of faith, attention is shifting to his predecessors, who took Germany down a strategic path towards Russia that became a dead end.
The conflict in the east has caused a seismic shift in Germany, where Scholz has made a U-turn on a restrictive stance on weapons exports, announced huge increases in military spending and vowed to wean the country off Russian gas.
Since then, all eyes have been on Gerhard Schröder, the unrepentant ex-chancellor who in his final weeks in power shook hands with Vladimir Putin to ratify the Nord Stream pipeline underneath the Baltic Sea. Just weeks later, Schröder slipped effortlessly through the revolving door to become chairman of Nord Stream. The resultant increase in Germany’s reliance on Russian energy, politicians in Berlin now concede, may have led Putin to believe Germany would be too hamstrung to support concerted economic sanctions.
As a paid-up lobbyist of energy giant Gazprom, Schröder’s motivation is transparent: on Friday, Scholz called on his party colleague and former boss to sever ties with Russian state-owned companies.
Less clear is why Schröder’s course of expanding economic ties with Russia was broadly continued by his successor, Angela Merkel, and whether she did so purely out of passivity or to her political advantage.
When Merkel ended her 16-year tenure in December, political obituaries singled out her dealings with Putin for praise: her support for economic sanctions over the occupation of Crimea, as well as the rescue effort she initiated to have the poisoned dissident Alexei Navalny treated at a Berlin hospital, spoke of anything but naivety in her interactions with the Kremlin.
But since last week, voices have been growing louder in criticising her sidelining of the foreign policy and security experts who warned her against seeing Russia as a reliable partner in trade. “A sober assessment of the German government’s misjudgments in its dealings with Russia over the last 16 years is now overdue,” said CDU politician and former Bundeswehr officer Roderich Kiesewetter.
“To Nato’s great surprise, France and Germany in 2008 blocked a Membership Action Plan for Georgia, warning that Russia would interpret it as an existential threat. But four months later, Russia invaded Georgia anyway. In 2014-2015, when the US wanted to arm Ukraine over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Merkel and [then French president François] Hollande opposed such a strategy, instead investing in diplomatic efforts,” Kiesewetter told the Observer.
“But in the shadow of such seeming diplomatic successes, Russia continued to build up its military threat.”
There are also fresh questions over Merkel’s unwavering support for the Nord Stream project, whose first pipeline she ceremonially unveiled in 2011. “With Nord Stream, it is now apparent that Germany was simply tricked by the Russian side: this was always a political and not a commercial project,” said Kiesewetter. “Germany never addressed the European and the security dimension of the project.”
In Merkel’s first term in power, a certain naivety towards the pipeline project could still be explained by her power-sharing arrangement with a Social Democratic Party (SPD) still moulded in Schröder’s image, and centre-left state premiers with openly pro-Russian sympathies in Germany’s north-eastern states, particularly in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
“In her home state, and in her constituency, Nord Stream was always an extremely popular undertaking,” said Claudia Müller, a Green delegate from the same region. “When it came to Russia, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern effectively ran its own shadow diplomacy.”
Even after her re-election in 2009, Merkel supported the continuation and expansion of a pipeline, insisting for years it was a purely “economic project”, even if she later conceded that certain “political factors” could not be ignored.
“Economic pragmatism in dealing with Russia wasn’t just a feature of the Social Democrats’ romanticism,” said Jana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations’ Berlin office. “Merkel, too, believed that through trade you could bind Russia into a multilateral system, and thus a rules-based order. Even after 2014-2015, when the alarm bells were ringing, she compartmentalised the problem. She simply didn’t turn it into a political issue.”
Research by Policy Network Analytics, a non-profit data intelligence network that connects political decisions to strategic economic investments, suggests Nord Stream’s political dimension may have been more apparent to her than she has let on. Merkel was raised in Germany’s north-east, where she won a direct mandate from a constituency covering the Baltic Sea island of Rügen. In the federalised political system, parliamentarians are not expected to act as amplifiers of their own regional concerns, and the chancellor even less so.
Yet in the summer of 2009, her home state crashed on to the national agenda: the Wadan Yards shipbuilding company in Schwerin and Rostock filed for insolvency. With national elections looming three months later, Merkel faced a humiliating loss of 2,700 jobs on her home turf.
Six weeks before the country went to the polls, Merkel’s press office announced a breakthrough: “The rescue of the Wadan Yards is in sight”. At a meeting in Sochi, Merkel and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev had brokered a deal whereby the shipyards would be bought by Vitaly Yusufov, saving half of the jobs at the company. Until then, the 29-year-old Yusufov had worked as head of the Moscow office of a certain Russian pipeline company: Nord Stream AG. His father, Igor, served as energy minister during Putin’s first term and was at the time coordinating Russia’s energy cooperations as a special envoy.
“There was considerable political pressure for Wadan Yards to be rescued, and it’s questionable whether the deal would have gone through so quickly without it”, said Klaus-Peter Schmidt-Deguelle, a communications adviser who was on the company’s advisory board at the time.
Even at the time, there had been rumours that the shipyards’ insolvent previous owner, Russian investor Andrei Burlakov, had merely been a straw man for a Russian mafia money-laundering plot, an allegation also made by a Spanish state prosecutor investigating Russian criminals’ activities in Spain. (A criminal investigation into laundering was discontinued by the state prosecutor in Schwerin in 2012, due to lack of cooperation from the Russian side).
“If Burlakov was a straw man, he stopped playing that role at some point, or otherwise he would still be alive,” Schmidt-Deguelle told the Observer. In September 2011, the Russian investor was shot by a hitman in a Moscow restaurant.
According to the German communiqué about the Sochi meeting, Merkel and Medvedev not only discussed a rescue deal for the Wadan Yards but also potential Russian investment in the struggling German carmaker Opel and the micro-chip manufacturer Infineon. Neither of those plans ever materialised, to Moscow’s disgruntlement. Russian media, however, reported that the two leaders were also to discuss an “energy cooperation”.
According to Nord Stream AG, planning for the second pipeline was put in motion two years later, though its exact origins have never been openly communicated.
Asked by the Observer via email if the energy cooperation discussed at Sochi was the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and whether the economic cooperations debated were contingent on one another, Merkel’s office declined to give an answer, referring instead to the only public statement she has made since the start of the war in Ukraine.
“There is no justification for this blatant breach of international law,” Merkel said four days after the start of the Russian invasion. “This war of aggression by Russia marks a profound turning point in the history of Europe after the end of the cold war.”"

Would Donald Trump make a good pantomime dame? His orange face, crazy talk, weird hair and baggy, saggy outfits are a natural fit for Mother Goose or Widow Twankey. Choleric, chaotic, always changeable, Trump might find cross-dressing a challenge. Then again, maybe not.
The future role of America’s “very stable genius” is but one of many dramatic questions marking the end of a grim year when politics frequently descended into dark farce. World leaders too often served up political pantomime, not serious, sensible statecraft. You had to laugh, or else you’d cry.
Pantomimes – theatrical entertainments based on folk stories and fairytales that feature clownish caricatures, old songs and corny gags, slapstick comedy, saucy innuendo and a degree of gender switching – have their roots in Italian commedia dell’arte. They offer light relief, distraction and a chance to poke fun at the powerful.
Characters such as Harlequin, Scaramouche, Pierrot and Pantaloon were transmogrified on the 19th- century English and American stage into dashing heroes and soppy heroines, despicable villains, incorrigible scallywags, feeble fops and hilarious fools. All are lampooned and ridiculed, often with satirical intent.
Modern pantos remain highly popular – and Boxing Day is traditionally the moment when the curtain goes up. Some UK performances have been cancelled or postponed again this year because of Covid worries. But as players and directors always insist, the show must go on.
So after all the crises, catastrophes, and avoidable and unavoidable grief that world leaders put everyone through in the past 12 months, it’s only fair to indulge in a bit of virtual seasonal tomfoolery and raillery at their expense. Please give a big hand for the cast of Political Panto 2021!
The Dame: Physical characteristics aside, Trump’s claim to be dame is boosted by his unmatched ability to bluster, boast and brag. He can also be extremely, unintentionally amusing. Only last week, the “once and future king” claimed the pandemic was a Chinese plot to foil his rightful bid to rule the world.
US presidents often overthrow foreign governments. Trump was the first to try to overthrow his own, thereby redefining the banana republic concept. He jokes he won the 2020 election – and keeps a straight face. He even thinks Vlad “the Impaler” Putin is cool. Besides, Trump would look cute in a dress. Gee, what a dame!
The Clown: Many contenders vie for the role of comic lead. Top acts include Éric Zemmour, the far-right presidential candidate of Algerian parentage, who says immigrants are destroying France, and Armin Laschet, the German conservative who thought floods were a laughing matter – until he was drowned out.
Channelling Dick Whittington, fallen idol Daniel Ortega voted himself lord mayor of Nicaragua – again! Iran’s turbaned mullah-in-chief, Ebrahim Raisi, who successfully hides his funny side, insisted he really doesn’t want nuclear bombs. Yo, Netanyahu! Just kidding!
Turkish straight man Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would jail Cinders, Goldilocks and the Pantomime Horse and Cow if he thought they supported the Kurds.
Yet after multiple standup auditions in posh boys’ drinking clubs at Eton, Oxford and Westminster, this year’s comic crown goes to Downing Street’s Buttons: knockabout gagster Boris Johnson, Britain’s pretend prime minister. BoJo partied on regardless as a locked-down nation died of laughter (or just died). As fools, humbugs and charlatans go, there’s no beating Boris!
The Fairy Godmother: This wondrous panto sprite dispenses universal goodwill, starlight and transcendental happiness without resorting to class A drugs. In Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, her magical powers protect her protege from a horrid fate, ensuring she lives happily ever after. Sic.
This godparent gig was performed for 16 years by Good Fairy Angela Merkel, known to Germans as “Mutti” (Mummy), firmly guiding a sleepy, slipshod EU. Merkel made the role her own. Now she’s hanging up her wand. Boo! Bad Fairies Liz Truss and Ursula von der Leyen are less glamorous understudies.
The Principal Boy: This goody-goody character, traditionally played by a woman in tights and thigh-length boots, could suit Joe Biden, who’s so nice it hurts – although he might trip on his heels. Gabriel Boric, the young socialist voted in as Chile’s president last week, may go far – except the same was said of Salvador Allende.
Yet with his charisma, sexy sideburns and strategic vision (as stated in his CV), Emmanuel Macron, the pocket-sized French president also known as Manu, Jupiter and “choupinet” (poppet or sweetie), is a boyish shoo-in. Macron vows to save Europe. Carol singers gratefully chorus: “O come, O come, Emmanuel!”
The Baddie: Villains were 10 a penny in 2021, and it’s hard to say who was worst. Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko staged a vicious parody of Babes in the Wood using helpless refugees. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, like the mean-spirited Grinch who stole Christmas, tried to cancel democracy.
In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, the climate-change-denying Wicked Witch of the West, could not see the wood for chopped-down trees. Like Aladdin, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, rubbed his lamp – and dreamed of rubbing out opponents. Myanmar’s genocidal general, Min Aung Hlaing, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte made the Three Ugly Sisters look positively attractive. In Russia, Putin – when not threatening to invade Ukraine – played Robin Hood backwards, stealing from the poor to make oligarchs rich.
But it’s China’s leader, Xi Jinping, who gets the nod as the baddiest baddie of them all. Whether it was horror in Xinjiang, hooliganism in Hong Kong, threats to bash Taiwan, dodgy debt deals in Africa, or cyberspying around the world, Xi seemed to be everywhere, like some wicked beanstalk giant or goggle-eyed, fire-breathing dragon.
Where’s St George when you really need him? As 2022’s political pantomime season opens, watch out for Xi. He’s behind you! Oh yes he is!"

Olaf Scholz will succeed Angela Merkel as Germany’s new chancellor after securing a majority of 395 of 736 delegates’ ballots in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday morning.
Scholz will oversee a liberal-left “traffic light” coalition government between his Social Democratic party (SPD), the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), the first power-sharing agreement of such a kind in Germany, and the first governing alliance with three parties since 1957.
Scholz, a former mayor of Hamburg and finance minister in Merkel’s final term, secured 21 fewer votes than the 416 seats the three coalition parties have in the Bundestag, though several politicians were absent from the vote because of illness.
Wearing a bordeaux red tie, the Social Democrat politician removed his black mask to accept the vote. Amid applause, delegates congratulated Scholz with fist bumps, handshakes and flowers. One gave him a basket of red apples.
Several politicians from Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, which plummeted to its worst result in German history at September’s national vote, also took the opportunity to congratulate Scholz on social media.
The conservatives’ failed chancellor candidate, Armin Laschet, who not only lost the election but will make way as party leader next spring, tweeted: “Even if we fought for a different result, we can count ourselves lucky that there is so much mutual respect between democrats in this country.”
After the vote Scholz headed to the Bellevue Palace residence of the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to be formally appointed.
By noon, he was back in the Bundestag to take his oath of office, swearing to use the powers bequeathed to him “for the good of the German people”. Scholz, who was raised in a Protestant household but later opted to leave the church, declined to utter the optional final line of the oath, “So help me God”.
As he became the first politician to re-fill the empty government benches vacated by Merkel’s team of ministers, Scholz bowed his head in front of the parliament in a show of humility.
Guests watching the ceremony from the visitors’ gallery included the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Scholz’s wife, Britta Ernst, his parents, Gerhard and Christel Scholz, and his brothers Jens and Ingo.
The new government was finally announced in parliament at 1:30 pm, after which the ministers in Scholz’s cabinet took their oaths.
The gender-equal new cabinet contains several firsts: women will for the first time hold Germany’s foreign and interior ministries, with the Green politician Annalena Baerbock in the former and the Social Democrat Nancy Faeser in the latter. The defence ministry will be held by Christine Lambrecht, the third consecutive woman in the role.
The agriculture minister, Cem Özdemir, of the Green party, will be the federal republic’s first minister with Turkish roots.
As the names of the new ministers were read out, the loudest cheer echoed around the chamber at the mention of Germany’s new health minister.
Karl Lauterbach, a studied epidemiologist and Harvard graduate who has been a mainstay of television panel debate throughout the pandemic, has become a hate figure for Germany’s anti-vaxxers and lockdown sceptics but was desired by many as the most qualified politician for the job in the health ministry.
Merkel, too, watched proceedings from the visitors’ gallery. The outgoing chancellor, who is ending her political career and will not continue as an MP, received a standing ovation from almost all delegates in the last minutes of her tenure. Only members of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland remained seated.
As the new president of the Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, read out the names of all delegates eligible to vote for the new chancellor, a mask-wearing Merkel scribbled furiously on a notepad.
Merkel’s final day as chancellor was her 5,860th day in office, falling short of the record set by her late former mentor Helmut Kohl by a mere ten days.
Merkel will formally hand over her offices at the chancellory in central Berlin to Scholz and his team on Wednesday. The cuboid building opposite the parliament, nicknamed the “federal washing machine”, has been the seat of German leaders since 2001, making Scholz only the third chancellor to govern from its premises.
Germany’s new head of government is expected to make his first trip abroad as soon as Friday, when he will also attend the “summit for democracy” hosted by the US president, Joe Biden, via video link. During September’s election campaign, Scholz had stated he would follow the example set by Merkel and make his first trip abroad to Paris.
Germany’s new chief diplomat, Baerbock, had vowed to make Brussels her first destination in office, and there have been reports in German media she could make a brief trip to the seat of the European Commission on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.
On Saturday and Sunday, Baerbock is due to attend a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool, where she could introduce herself to her colleagues from Britain, France, the US, Italy, Japan and Canada.
Scholz’s new spokesperson and representatives of the 14 federal ministers will hold their first press conference on Monday, in keeping with a thrice-weekly question-and-answer session with the media.
Merkel’s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, has indicated his intention to withdraw from politics, with his tweets from the official government handle to be archived."

After 16 years of gruelling European summits, late-light coalition negotiations and back-to-back conference calls with heads of state, Angela Merkel has vowed to spend the foreseeable future kicking back her flat black shoes and reading a few good books.
But newly emerged details of a new office in central Berlin and veiled hints in interviews suggests the world may not have seen the last of Germany’s outgoing chancellor yet.
Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will be sworn in at the president’s Bellevue Palace on Wednesday at noon, after which Merkel will “withdraw from political life” and “not attend any appointments for a period of months”, her long-serving spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, said last Friday.
In a video conference with parliamentarians from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Tuesday, the outgoing chancellor reportedly said she would remain available for questions but not give any advice in public.
Merkel has rejected suggestions she may don a white lab coat and return to scientific research with her husband, quantum chemist Joachim, who recently extended his contract as a senior researcher at Berlin’s Humboldt University until 2022.
“I can see myself regularly speaking out about the connection between our prosperity, research and innovation – but I’m sure I won’t be doing any scientific work,” she told Reuters last month.
Since entering politics in reunified Germany in 1990, she had barely had a minute to consider what could interest her afterwards, the chancellor said at an event in September with the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
“I want to think very carefully in the now-approaching phase of my life about the question of what surfaces in me,” Merkel said. “Do I want to write, speak, hike, do I want to be at home, do I want to travel the world?”
A move to her birthplace, Hamburg, where the chancellor was rumoured to have purchased a property in the wealthy suburb of Blankenese, were quashed on the campaign trail in September, where she assured the citizens of Germany’s north-east that Berlin and Brandenburg state would remain the centre of her life.
She would certainly not “accept the first invitation coming in just because I am scared of doing nothing”, Merkel said while accepting an honorary degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in July.
Doing nothing doesn’t seem a realistic prospect, or so a document her office submitted to a Bundestag committee last month would suggest.
According to the official request that was later leaked to German press, Merkel has asked to have her future office on Berlin’s Unter den Linden boulevard staffed with nine employees, two of them office managers, two specialist assistants, three clerks and two drivers.
For comparison, her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, worked from an office with seven employees after he lost to Merkel in 2005. Schröder, of course, rushed to leave a stain on his political legacy by taking up a job with the Russian pipeline company Nord Stream, only months after leaving the chancellery.
His predecessor, Helmut Kohl, whose old offices Merkel will take over, used his political retirement to start a company offering lucrative strategic advice and lobbying services.
Germany’s first female chancellor would find the revolving door between politics and business at least temporarily jammed: a law passed in 2015 bars holders of political high office from switching straight to lobbying for at least a year, and up to 18 months.
After catching up with reading during her self-imposed break, perhaps Merkel will find herself taking inspiration from a novel published this spring. David Safier’s crime novel Miss Merkel imagines the chancellor retiring to her dacha in the Uckermark district of Brandenburg in the north-east of the country but soon grows bored and investigates unsolved murders instead."

Olaf Scholz is to be voted in as chancellor by the Bundestag on Wednesday, opening a new chapter in German and European politics as the Merkel era comes to an end.
Scholz, the outgoing deputy chancellor and finance minister, will lead a government composed of his Social Democrat party, the business-friendly Free Democrats and the Greens, a coalition of parties never tried before at the federal level in Germany.
The alliance brings to a close 16 years of rule by Angela Merkel, who chose not to run again. During her turbulent time in office, spanning eurozone crises, more than a million refugee arrivals and Brexit, there have been four French presidents, five British prime ministers and eight Italian premiers.
The 177-page coalition agreement, entitled Dare More Progress, was signed by the party leaders at a ceremony at Berlin’s Futurium Museum on Tuesday. It was “the moment the post-Merkel era begins for real”, tweeted the political editor of Deutsche Welle’s international channel, Michaela Kuefner.
The agreement had already received strong backing from the three parties, clearing the way for Scholz to be voted in by Germany’s lower house on Wednesday.
Chancellor: Olaf Scholz (SPD)
The 63-year old former mayor of the northern port city of Hamburg served as finance minister under Angela Merkel as part of the ""grand coalition"" between his SPD and her conservatives.
He engineered a multibillion-euro rescue package for the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
He said his first foreign trip as chancellor would be to France, a nod to the importance of a functioning Franco-German alliance to reforming the eurozone and strengthening the European Union.
Vice-chancellor and minister for economy, climate protection, digital transformation and energy transition: Robert Habeck (Greens)
The 52-year-old environmental party co-leader will head a beefed-up ministry that has overseen both the distribution of financial lifelines to businesses affected by lockdown and implementing a strategy to develop large-scale green hydrogen. In future, it will also have responsibility for the climate issues that are the Greens' raison d'etre.
Finance: Christian Lindner (FDP)
The 42-year-old leader of the liberal and fiscally conservative FDP has said he will keep in place strict limits on new public borrowing and not raise taxes to finance ambitious investments to wean the economy off fossil fuels and upgrade Germany's infrastructure for the digital age.
His championing of austerity and strict budget rules in the eurozone could set him on a collision course with counterparts in southern EU states such as Italy and Spain.
Foreign affairs: Annalena Baerbock (Greens)
Baerbock, 40, will be Germany's first female foreign minister. The Greens' co-leader will have to balance her party's demands for a tougher line on human rights in Russia and China against Scholz's likely preference not to risk a confrontation with the two countries over issues such as Taiwan and Ukraine.
Defence: Christine Lambrecht (SPD)
Lambrecht, 56, who currently serves as justice minister, will become the third successive female defence minister after the current minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Ursula von der Leyen, now president of the European Commission.
Lambrecht, who has been outspoken against rightwing extremism, would be in charge of the German army, which has been plagued by a series of reports in recent years about radical elements within its ranks.
Health: Karl Lauterbach (SPD)
The 58-year-old, trained as a doctor, has been an outspoken proponent of tougher coronavirus restrictions throughout the pandemic, and will become the next health minister.
Lauterbach, who studied epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, has advocated for mandatory vaccinations, stricter restrictions on the unvaccinated and the closure of all bars and clubs until the fourth wave of infections is over. Reuters
The new government has a full in-tray, from Germany’s spiralling number of coronavirus cases to Russian troop movements on the Ukrainian border, on top of its priorities to overhaul the German economy by modernising creaking infrastructure and sharply reducing fossil fuels.
Scholz said any moves by Russia to cross the Ukrainian border would be unacceptable. “It is very, very important that no one rolls through the history books to draw new borders,” Scholz told reporters after signing the coalition agreement.
He was less firm when asked about China, skirting questions on whether Germany would join a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
The new chancellor, an architect of the EU’s coronavirus recovery fund, said his first trip outside Germany would be to Paris and Brussels, as he seeks to ensure that “Europe is secure and sovereign”.
Scholz’s approach to EU discussions will differ from that of Merkel, who grew up in East Germany. The outgoing chancellor was credited with a special understanding of EU members from the former Communist bloc, but also criticised for failing to tackle the threat to democratic values in Hungary and Poland.
Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who quit Merkel’s centre-right European People’s party grouping, said when Merkel leaves office “a piece of the life of the central Europeans will go with her”. In an article to mark her departure, he criticised Merkel’s decision to open Germany to Syrian refugees in 2015, while revealing his suspicion of what he called “the new, leftwing German government’s pro-immigration, pro-gender, federalist, pro-German Europe agenda”.
“One thing is for sure: the era of ambiguity, stealth politics and drifting has ended with Merkel. We now prepare for battle with our eyes wide open.”
Germany’s incoming government has agreed that EU authorities should act more urgently to defend the rule of law, including withholding EU funds if necessary.
The unity of the coalition could be tested by the Nord Stream II pipeline, which is to transport gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. The incoming vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, which campaigned to abolish the project, said the pipeline had not received approval and political discussion would continue.
Habeck, a former translator of British poet Ted Hughes, also said it would take two to three years to see the result of investment in renewable energy.
By 2030 the new government wants to have phased out coal and have 15 million electric cars on the roads.
Christian Lindner, the Free Democrats’ leader and next finance minister, said: “We have no illusions we face great challenges.”"

Germany’s next coalition government, which will be sworn in on Wednesday, will come with a lineup of new faces, a new set of policy priorities and a new dose of energy. It will also speak with a distinctive accent.
Olaf Scholz, the centre-left politician who will step into Angela Merkel’s shoes, is a man of the German north not only by upbringing but by voice. When the former mayor of Hamburg recently warned in parliament that Covid-19 had not yet been beaten, he leaned into the stretched out fricatives typical of Germany’s second-largest city: Scholz pronounces the word besiegt as besiecht.
Meetings of his cabinets will be more likely to open with a casually mumbled Moin Moin than the Servus greeting exclusive to the states of the south. In Scholz’s chief of staff, Wolfgang Schmidt, (also from Hamburg), the vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck (from Kreis Plön in Schleswig Holstein), the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and the labour minister, Hubertus Heil, (both from Lower Saxony), several leading voices around the table hail from the northern third of the country.
Regional representation is a matter of utmost importance in Germany’s decentralised political system and governments work hard to give each of the 16 federal states their due share of the seats of power in Berlin.
But a shift of balance under Scholz is already discernible. For one, his cabinet will be the first in the country’s postwar history without a minister from Bavaria. Germany’s largest and southernmost state ended up “on the subs’ bench”, the general secretary of Bavaria’s ruling Christian Social Union grumbled this week.
In many ways the northward drift of German political power goes against the grain. The south dominates the country in economic terms: it has most of the big companies registered on the German stock exchange, provides homes to more start-ups, employs more IT professionals and registers more patents than the north. It reigns supreme in German football, where traditional northern clubs like Werder Bremen and Hamburg SV have fallen into decline while Bayern Munich wins trophy after trophy.
But in politics the centre of gravity has been quietly shifting north ever since the seat of parliament was moved from Bonn in the Rhineland to Berlin. After the Hamburg-born, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern-raised Merkel and the Hanoverian Gerhard Schröder, Scholz is the third northern chancellor in a row; the last four deputies have all come from northern states.

To an extent the strength of the north is a result of the weakness of the south and south-west, where the conservative party bloc is particularly prone to infighting. Had the Christian Democratic Union overcome its complicated relationship with its Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union, the Bundestag may well have seen the CSU leader, Markus Söder, sworn as chancellor on Wednesday.
Tom Mannewitz, a political scientist at the Federal University for Public Administration, said: “With festering inner-party factionalism and the historic split between the CDU and CSU, the conservative bloc has a strategic disadvantage in Germany’s south.”
Even so, accents play a surprisingly important role in German politics. Scholz’s speech, while still displaying distinctive northern markers, is a far cry from the strong Hamburg dialect of his idol Helmut Schmidt. As with Merkel and Schröder, most Germans would be likely to identify his accent as standard German or Hochdeutsch, lending him an everyman quality that politicians from south of the so-called Uerdingen line, separating “high” and “low” dialects of German, can struggle to attain.
“We are increasingly seeing that the northern German type of politician who speaks in high German enjoys more acceptance across the country as a whole,” said Jürgen Falter, a political scientist at the University of Mainz. “Southern politicians, by contrast, often struggle to shake off an air of provincialism.”
The last two contenders who fell short in their run for the top job, the Social Democrat Martin Schulz in 2017 and Merkel’s designated successor, Armin Laschet, at this September’s election, both hailed from Aachen, close to the old power centre of the Bonn republic, and sounded that way when they spoke.
Their folksy appeal, a boon at state level or in the European parliament, became a burden as they tried to storm the national stage, evoking stereotypes of jolly but unserious carnival jesters: Laschet’s ratings dived spectacularly after he was filmed laughing at a joke during a sombre event in a town hit by summer’s flash floods.
Michael Elmentaler, a professor of linguistics at the University of Kiel, said: “After the second world war, there was a series of strong German leaders whose regional accents were accepted as part of their identity, from Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard to Kurt Kiesinger and Helmut Kohl.
“What we are seeing now, however, is that the tolerance towards regional dialects is waning. If a German politician spoke like Adenauer today, people would laugh at him.”
Linguists like Elmentaler have charted the disappearance of regional dialects not just from the German national parliament but also town halls and television networks, where the language of news presenters has become more casual but also more standardised. Linguistic quirks associated with specific cities or towns have made way for broader “regiolects”.
If Scholz’s northern identity helped him claim the chancellory, will it also shape his management of the country?
“There’s a powerful cliche of a certain type of northern German politician, the Hanseat,” said Christoph Strupp, a historian at Hamburg’s Research Centre for Contemporary History. “They are supposed to be sober pragmatists, humble in their public appearance, with an independence of mind suitable to a city state, and with a knack for finding compromises.”
While large states like North Rhine-Westphalia have different power centres whose interests can be hard to reconcile by a single politician, in Hamburg “there’s a closeness of politics, business and the media that can make it easier to build a consensus”, said Strupp.
“Scholz certainly lives up to many of the Hanseatic cliches,” Strupp said – both in the negative and the positive sense. “He proved himself capable of holding together a red-green coalition that wasn’t short of conflicts. He managed to find decisive and workable solutions to festering problems in the city, such as the over-budget Elbphilharmonie concert hall or the shortage of housing.”
Hamburg’s town hall lies adjacent to the city’s chamber of commerce, with a skyway bridge connecting the two buildings – a symbol, some say, of a proximity between political and business interests that has created a culture of backroom deals. Running for the Hamburg mayorship in 2011, Scholz simply recruited the president of the chamber of commerce as his business senator – and won."

The end of Angela Merkel’s reign as German chancellor was marked with Beethoven, a romantic chanson and an East German pop hit, all played with clockwork precision by the Bundeswehr military band.
After 16 years in office, Angela Merkel is handing over to Olaf Scholz next week, and was awarded a military tattoo in her honour, the highest tribute to a civilian. Dressed in a simple black coat and black gloves, Europe’s most powerful politician looked sombre, betraying little emotion, as she watched torch-carrying soldiers in full regalia parade through the courtyard of Berlin’s defence ministry.
Hours before the ceremony, Merkel had announced tougher measures to curb Germany’s soaring coronavirus cases, including what her successor called “a lockdown of the unvaccinated”.
At the event she said her four terms were “eventful and often very challenging years.
“They have challenged me politically and humanly and, at the same time, they were also fulfilling.”
The event began with a Beethoven military march and ended with Ich bete an die Macht Liebe (I pray to the power of love), a traditional song that has been part of the ceremony since the Napoleonic wars. During this piece the soldiers removed their grey helmets and Merkel briefly smiled at the officer leading the band as the final bars faded.
The custom of the Großer Zapfenstreich or Grand tattoo ceremony dates back to the 16th century, but the German military’s highest honour has only been bestowed on chancellors since the departure in 1998 of Helmut Kohl, whose farewell was held in front of the Speyer Cathedral in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
While Schröder’s Großer Zapfenstreich was attended by 600 guests, Merkel is reported to have invited only about 200, including the 52 ministers that have served under her tenure. She was seated next to Germany’s current defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a protege once tipped to replace Merkel, but who never won over their CDU party. Another protege, Ursula von der Leyen, the current president of the European Commission and a former family and defence minister under Merkel, was not expected to attend.
The military band played three songs chosen by Merkel: the Christian hymn Großer Gott, wir loben Dich (Holy God, we praise thy name), Hildegard Knef’s chanson Für mich soll’s rote Rosen regnen (It should rain red roses for me), Nina Hagen’s Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen (You forgot the colour film) – the last pick an GDR pop hit of the 1970s that pays tribute to Merkel’s East German upbringing in a way she has rarely done while in office.
Understood as a criticism of the drab reality of East German communism, the song is an angry lament that admonishes Hagen’s boyfriend Michael for having only taken a black and white film on their holiday to Hiddensee island. As a result, she wails, “no one will believe how beautiful it was here”.
Merkel had described the song as “a highlight of my youth” and noted that it was set in the region that was her Baltic Sea constituency “so it all fits”.
After the event, Germany’s current economy minister and close ally Peter Altmaier tweeted that it was “a great Zapfenstreich for a great Chancellor”. Alluding to Hagen’s song, he said: “Angela Merkel explained to us in black and white when it was serious and important” adding in English, “Thx a lot. We will badly miss you.”
Merkel is expected to handover the chancellorship to Olaf Scholz next week but, first, the incoming government’s coalition agreement will need to be approved by the three parties involved.
Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD) will hold a party congress on Saturday, where its delegates are expected to ratify the deal under which the centre-left will return to the chancellery for the first time since 2005. Unlike in 2013 and 2018, the SPD won’t give a vote on the future power-sharing agreement to its entire membership.
The liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) will hold a vote at a digital congress the day after, while the Green party’s members have until 6 December to approve or reject the agreement. While many members of the ecological party have voiced criticisms of the environmental aspects of the deal, a rejection is seen as unlikely.
Once the document has been approved by all three parties, Scholz could be sworn in as Germany’s next leader as soon as Monday 6 December and no later than the end of Wednesday. On Thursday, a German chancellor will have to represent the country at the “summit for democracy” hosted by the US president, Joe Biden.
Merkel is most likely to hand over the chancellery on the same day as Scholz’s swearing in."

Vaccination could become mandatory in Germany from February, Angela Merkel has said, as she announced what her successor as chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described as “a lockdown of the unvaccinated”.
As more EU countries confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, which the bloc’s health agency said could make up more than half of all infections on the continent within months, Merkel described the situation as “very serious”.
Meeting with Scholz and Germany’s 16 state leaders for emergency talks on Thursday on tougher measures to stem rocketing Covid cases, the outgoing chancellor said an “act of national solidarity” was required.
“We have understood that the situation is very serious and that we want to take further measures in addition to those already taken,” she said. “To do this, the fourth wave must be broken, and this has not yet been achieved.”
Daily new infections in Germany have broken records in recent weeks, with many hospitals operating at or over capacity. Authorities said 73,209 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. Deaths have surged from a rolling seven-day average of just over 10 a day in August to nearly 300 this week.
Merkel said Germany’s ethics council would issue formal guidance on a vaccine mandate, and the Bundestag would vote on the legislation by the end of the year. If passed, the rule would come into force from February.
“Given the situation, I think it is appropriate to adopt compulsory vaccination,” said Merkel, who is due hand over to Scholz next week.
The move would follow the example of neighbouring Austria, which is planning mandatory vaccinations from February. Greece also announced mandatory jabs for the over-60s, with unvaccinated people facing fines if they fail to comply.
Merkel also announced a blanket ban on people who have not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid entering bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and other leisure venues, as well as non-essential shops and Christmas markets. In areas where the incidence rate exceeds 350 per 100,000 people, discos and nightclubs will close.
Private gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 outdoors, providing everyone involved has been vaccinated or recovered. But if there are unvaccinated people in the mix, households may invite a maximum of two outside guests, not including children, Merkel said. Masks are to become compulsory in schools.
The lockdown measures are expected to be approved by MPs in the coming days and will take effect immediately afterwards.
Experts have blamed the fourth wave on Germany’s relatively low vaccination rate of about 68%. For comparison, Spain has fully vaccinated 79% of its population and Portugal 86%.
“From the point of view of intensive and emergency medicine, the pandemic situation has never been as threatening and serious as it is today,” Germany’s intensive care association said.
Merkel’s outgoing government had previously ruled out mandatory vaccination, but the measure has since won broad political backing. “We don’t have enough vaccinated people,” Scholz said after the meeting. “We now know that this has consequences.”
Authorities in Norway said the new variant had been detected in one person out of more than 50 who tested positive for Covid after an office Christmas dinner party in an Oslo restaurant on Friday, and they expected more cases to follow.
The Norwegian government reintroduced some restrictions to cope with the emergence of the Omicron variant, including testing all travellers arriving in Norway within 24 hours of arrival, whether vaccinated or not.
France announced its first Omicron case on the mainland, in an unvaccinated man from the greater Paris region recently returned from a trip to Nigeria, and said it was awaiting the results of sequencing tests on his wife, who had also tested positive, to see if she was also infected with the variant.
Regional authorities in Madrid said they had detected Spain’s first domestic Omicron case, in a vaccinated person who had not travelled to any countries considered at risk or met anyone who had, and were investigating two other similar suspected cases.
Dutch health authorities called for pre-flight tests for all travel from outside the EU after it emerged that almost all of the 62 passengers who tested positive after arriving on two flights from South Africa on 26 November, including those with the variant, were fully vaccinated."

Angela Merkel will ceremonially bow out of office on with a military tattoo held in her honour on Thursday evening, before she is expected to formally hand over her seat of power to Olaf Scholz in the first half of next week.
Featuring torch-carrying soldiers in full military regalia, precision choreography and three songs of the outgoing chancellor’s own choosing played by a marching band, the event will mark the high point of Merkel’s leaving tour after 16 years of holding office.
Due to coronavirus restrictions the ceremony will be more low-key than those that honoured her predecessors Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Kohl when they left office.
Broadcast live on German television from 7.20pm, the ceremony in the courtyard outside the defence ministry in Berlin will start with a short speech by the chancellor and wrap up after just over an hour, without a reception.
The custom of the Großer Zapfenstreich ceremony dates back to the 16th century, but the German military’s highest honour has only been bestowed on chancellors since the departure in 1998 of Helmut Kohl, whose farewell was held in front of the Speyer Cathedral in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
While Schröder’s Großer Zapfenstreich was attended by 600 guests, Merkel is reported to have invited only about 200, including the 52 ministers that have served under her tenure. Ursula von der Leyen, the current president of the European Commission and a former family and defence minister under Merkel, is unlikely to attend due to a meeting with South American heads of state scheduled for the same day.
As the soundtrack for her leaving ceremony, Merkel has reportedly chosen the Christian hymn Großer Gott, wir loben Dich (Holy God, we praise thy name), Hildegard Knef’s chanson Für mich soll’s rote Rosen regnen (It should rain red roses for me), Nina Hagen’s Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen (You forgot the colour film) – the latter pick a GDR pop hit of the 1970s that pays tribute to Merkel’s East German upbringing in a way she has rarely done while in office.

After 16 years in office, Angela Merkel is stepping down on Thursday as chancellor of Germany. The former UK prime minister Tony Blair said she had “often defined modern Germany” and Romano Prodi, Italian prime minister between 2006 and 2008, said a new European strategy and the next-generation EU would be part of the “great legacy” she leaves.
People across Europe share their views on her leadership in Germany and the role she has played in the European Union.
I’m part of generation Merkel and grew up only knowing Angela Merkel as the chancellor of Germany. Having a woman, who with a PhD, is the most influential office in Germany, showed me that a girl can become anything. In the midst of many male politicians it was a relief to see a female representative leading German politics. Her calmness and reliability always gave me a sense of security in society. Though I wouldn’t consider myself politically conservative/centre-right I admire(d) her because she led us steadily through many crises. My main criticism would be her blindness in terms of green and climate friendly policy. I approve of her stepping down to allow a change in leadership but I worry when I look at the current frontrunners for office. Xenia Cleuvers, 23, student, Cologne, Germany
There are only a few points where I have agreed with Angela Merkel – one being the 2015 refugee crisis, when she “opened the doors” (in my opinion the only right thing to do). Other than that, her rule is a mix of ‘let’s just continue how we have always done it’ and ‘only change something if it is absolutely necessary’. But since Germany was/is doing well economically, people kept voting for her. Merkel became the symbol of stability, and Germans love stability. The climate crisis is Merkel’s biggest failure. As a former minister for environment she warned about the dramatic effects of climate change, but when in power, did nothing meaningful to present solutions. To me she will always be the the quiet, logical, unemotional politician. Tom Stolzenberger, 24, law student, Germany
Merkel’s politics are responsible for nearly destroying the nascent but strong renewable energies sector that the previous government had strongly supported. By destroying all her potential successors politically, Merkel left behind a power vacuum in the conservative part of German society. In an essentially conservative country, built on seeking stability and wealth rather than progress and opportunity, she thus leaves it in the worst possible political circumstances. No, her track record is hardly admirable and I remain baffled at how long she managed to cling to power despite the many problems. I say good riddance!Frithjof Stöppler, 40, academic, Stockholm, Sweden
Honest, brave, responsible, played for the long game and kept her principles throughout all her time in office. Genuinely cared about people. Puts other state leaders to shame! Niki, 65, photographer, France
I think Angela Merkel has been a strong focal point when it comes to Europe and the world at large. She put Germany at the forefront and opened up the doors for migrants while she was in office. She’s seen by many as a saviour economically, and she has helped a lot of people and countries all over the world through commerce and trade, funding of NGOs, and international organisations. I really think Germany and Europe will miss her dynamic leadership style. Let’s hope her dreams for Europe will outlive her tenure in office. Lucky, 32, Italy
I believe Germany mishandled the eurozone crisis, and is responsible for significantly worsening the state of all the southern European countries by imposing on them unpopular and, more importantly, ineffective austerity policies. Later on, her decision to let 1 million refugees into Germany was received positively in Greece, where most people thought that rich European countries should take in more refugees. In a world where Trump was the US president, and the UK was on its way out of the EU, Merkel and Germany seemed like the last beacons of hope and stability. Overall, I think most Greek people will not miss her. Germany and Europe as a whole need a change and her departure is a golden opportunity to make this change and reform Europe before it is too late. Doros Georgiou, 35, research analyst, Athens, Greece
Merkel’s been a disaster for Germany and Europe. After 16 years as chancellor, Germany has become more and more alike the former GDR (German Democratic Republic), where she’s from. In her early years in office I felt she hardly made any decisions, and even when she did it was only after evaluating the public opinion, just to stay popular. The major decisions she made were a catastrophe, like migrant politics and nuclear energy. Merkel has divided the German population and citizens are without a common dialogue. I’m very sad, because Germany was a great place to live in the 70s-00s. I’m afraid that none of the candidates for office will be able to bring order to the mess Merkel leaves behind her.MA, 69, retired immunologist, Portugal
I can’t agree on everything with Merkel, but I admire her. A skilful negotiator, she has established bridges between allies and opponents throughout Europe and at home. I’ve been watching from Spain about how she has curbed unemployment and public deficit in Germany with respect. We live in a time of great polarisation and it has been a relief to see a politician focused on the problems.. What I like most about her is that she treats her voters as if they are adults. I hope some of her style will prevail in Europe in the following decade. If not, I’ll miss her.Carlos Martín Carretié, 22, Seville, Spain
I’m not very much into politics but it doesn’t interrupt me seeing her as the most stable European political figure. She was and is a quintessence of what a politician should be – calm, consistent but determined and pragmatic, serious but a visionary. I guess I emphasise on that, because, unwillingly and with sadness in my heart, I make a comparison with our local political space. Just this year, we had our third election in November. Politicians are recklessly playing with the nerves of the people and are wasting money. The more I’m sad and disappointed from our Bulgarian political nonsense, the more I admire, in general, people who know where they are, what is expected from them to be and to do. In my eyes, Angela Merkel is exactly what a politician should be – 16 years, wow. Evgenia Sasha, 62, Sofia, Bulgaria
A steady hand on the tiller –consistent and reliable. I liked that Merkel allowed 1 million refugees to immigrate into the EU in 2016 and stood up to Trump. Since Germany is a leading country in Europe, we have been fortunate to have had stable leadership for such a long time. I also like that she handed over leadership of her party in plenty of time so that they could prepare for a potential new Kanzler [chancellor], and that she is stepping away, not being pushed out (how rare in politics is that?). Great to see a woman in a powerful position. Síle McNutt, 60, environmentalist and artist, Co Donegal, Ireland
First impressions are important, and I was initially sceptical about Merkel. The Greek crisis did not help as well. Nevertheless, against all odds and just as the public perception was tilting away from her, my perception of Merkel completely changed with her refugee crisis response. I also started to appreciate much more her role as a compromise and consensus builder in the EU institutions. Now, I share some anxiety about the future of Germany and Europe after ‘Mutti’s’ retirement. Will the engine of European project hold? How are our neighbours in the western Balkans waiting room supposed to find a new ally? It seems that it’s going to be a serious challenge for any future German chancellor who aims to fill in her shoes. Mirko Savković, 28, Banovci, Croatia
The hasty post-Fukushima decision to close down Germany’s nuclear power plants by 2022, while only just having negotiated a coal shutdown target of 2038, has ensured Germany had continued to be one of Europe’s greatest climate sinners, contrary to the country’s image of itself as making good progress on environmental targets. Even as a chancellor who favoured stability over reform, she did nonetheless leave her mark on the country, and those few surprising daring decisions of her time in office stand out all the more for their comparative rarity. Her greatest success as a politician may be the one she repeated from her predecessor Kohl: she so skilfully and diplomatically wields power that nobody in her party, perhaps nobody in all of Germany, seems like they can replace her. Daphne Preston-Kendal, 28, UK student, lives in Germany
The difficulty with leaders such as Merkel, is that due to their popularity and prevalence, people find it hard to see a future without them. I do not have much to comment about her policies, as we do not see eye to eye on many subjects, but as she has defined Germany through her position as chancellor throughout most of my life, I look forward to the change that her successor is sure to bring. Long reigns often leave long shadows, and so will Merkel’s as well. There is a generation that has not known a Germany without her. Due to her popularity and long time in office, it will be difficult for the next chancellor to measure up to her. Things will surely go on, but her successor not only has Germany to keep in mind, but the whole continent as well. Chris, 18, student, Finland"

Three of those at her first G8 summit look back on her legacy
European Commission president, 2004-14
In the 10 years I led the European Commission, Angela Merkel was clearly the most influential national leader in Europe. But at her first G8 summit, in 2006, she was still relatively shy, maybe even a bit suspicious, as the photo shows.
My impression is that this didn’t have anything to do with her being a woman. Instead, I linked it to her background: politicians from countries with a recent totalitarian past tend to be a little reserved when they first enter the European or international stage.
I remember a conversation with her and the president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera. Piñera had entered politics at the end of the Pinochet era, after a career in business. She asked why did he engage in politics because she was trying to compare her political experience, coming also from a non-democratic country, with that of the Chilean president.
Merkel was very candid: she told us that when she was very young she wanted to join the Young Pioneers, the East German socialist party’s youth organisation, not because of its ideology but because there were some interesting activities and some travel there, but she understood that she would never be welcomed there as a daughter of a Christian pastor. Her attitude towards politics was one of a pragmatic distrust of power.
This also involved, at least at the beginning of her relationship with Nicolas Sarkozy, the leader of France, her biggest ally in Europe, a very clear attitude of mistrust. I was in many meetings with the two of them because of the sovereign debt crisis, and you could hardly have found a more different pair of people in terms of temperament: one of them a true intuitive political animal, the other rational, prudent, detail-oriented.I saw her emotionally hurt by comments Sarkozy made. Over a glass of wine after a dinner – Merkel likes a good glass of red, just not during Lent – she confessed to me that she heard the French president saying that France, unlike Germany, did not constantly have to apologise for the past. She was almost crying when she relayed that episode.
People have an image of Merkel as being rational to the point of coldness. But I saw her several times with sincere emotion. She’s very German, at the end of the day, a patriot, and a passionate supporter of the German football team, who once complained to the Italian prime minister Mario Monti about his country’s players being too aggressive in a match against her side.
And yet she is very rationally pro-European: in spite of her suspicions, she tied the fate of the German people to the European Union and the eurozone, eventually supporting all the instruments introduced to protect the single currency. With Sarkozy, too, she knew that it was vital for Germany and France to find a common ground, and she worked on that.
Germany in the Merkel era has been criticised for allowing economic interests to influence its stance on Russia. That overlooks her strong support for sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and her clear words on the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.
With Vladimir Putin, the only other leader from that photo in 2006 who is still in power, Merkel always got the tone right. She has shown respect for Russia and its history, and she would have never called it a “regional power” like Obama did. At the same time, she was always extremely firm on matters of principle.
I remember the 2007 EU-Russia summit in Samara and a conversation between Putin, Merkel and myself. There had recently been a rupture of the Druzhba pipeline system, which is crucial for transmitting oil to western Europe and the Baltic states. We knew Russia was behind it, but Putin denied it, claiming it was an accident. Merkel pushed him brilliantly. Why don’t you repair it, she asked. It’s expensive, Putin said. We’ll pay for it, Merkel replied. Putin lost his temper at that point. Why are you always defending the Baltics, he asked us.
Merkel had learned something from Helmut Kohl: in the European Union, you have to pay attention to everyone, not just the big personalities and the big countries.
You could also see that at G20 summits: most leaders enter the room and only shake hands with their counterparts. Merkel was different. She would also say hello to the aides of different delegations. She wouldn’t just say hello to Obama, she would also speak to Mike Froman, the US president’s Sherpa. Of course, Froman was delighted.
Why was she doing it? I think it’s partly her temperament, but she also knew she could get more information out of the aides who had read the paperwork with more detail than the heads of state.
UK prime minster, 1997-2007
Angela Merkel has often defined modern Germany. Not in terms of her longevity in office, but in the spirit she has symbolised: calm, assured, reasonable and rational, sound common sense personified, collaborating across national boundaries, ushering in progressive reform at home.
I was close to her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, coming from the same wing of politics as we did, but got to know Angela first when she was leader of the opposition and then as chancellor during my final years as prime minister when we developed a friendship that has endured after I left office.
Her period as chancellor has seen her weather the financial crisis, the threat of populism, the refugee crisis, Brexit and now Covid. Her strategic management of the country, as well as deep contribution to European affairs, has been a bedrock of stability in a period of deep change and challenge.
Many will remember her chancellorship for highly competent crisis management, pragmatism and seriousness. But my recollections of our interactions that are as much about her warmth, her wisdom and her humour. One of the recent times we met in Berlin we concluded a meeting on the future of Africa, only for her to realise the Chancellery appeared completely deserted. Unperturbed, Angela got up and said she would escort us out the building herself. After a number of wrong turns, the building being something of a labyrinth, she finally managed to escort us out, but completely without irritation or any sense of status.
Each politician has a dominant part of their political psyche. For Angela, it is seeing compromise, and the navigation of political challenge with the maximum attention to practical solution, as a strength and not a weakness.
Throughout the eurozone crisis, she performed an intractable task: helping the poorer countries of the European Union in the face of the existential threat to their stability, whilst keeping German public opinion onside, which not unnaturally felt Germany should not have to bail out those countries whose reforms were proceeding too slowly.
In fact, her legacy on Europe is to have steered it through extraordinarily difficult times, when a Europe now of 27 countries has had to struggle with multiple crises. I know how she felt about Brexit – she was profoundly saddened by it. But she was always afterwards determined not to be churlish about the decision the British had taken.
Even her greatest domestic crisis – the pledge to take a million Syrian refugees – came from a place of compassion.
She was the arch anti-populist, in character and policy. Her leadership will be deeply missed.
Italian prime minister, 2006-08
The last time I met Angela Merkel was in Assisi in 2018 when the Franciscan Friars conferred on her the “Lamp of Peace” because of her merits in preserving peace in Europe. During the ceremony I reflected on the reasons why she deserved the award: not because of her strong declarations or unexpected actions, but rather for succeeding in balancing Germany’s national interests with the exigencies of the European project. Indeed, while acknowledging the increasingly dominant role of Germany in the economy of the continent, she was also able to mediate between nationalistic pressures and the solidarity with European partners.
Although this dilemma arose on many occasions, she always managed to find a final compromise, as in the Greek and the Syrian refugee crises. She was able to reconcile short-term pressures with the long-term interests of European solidarity, which is indispensable also for the future role of Germany in the world.Thanks to the trust that the German people have granted her, Chancellor Merkel has had the opportunity to develop a new European strategy after the pandemics. The next-generation EU is not only the symbol of the common fight against the crisis but also and foremost a sign of the irreversibility of the European project. This is the great legacy that Angela Merkel will leave for the future of Germany and Europe."

Angela Merkel has left Germans wondering how well they really know the chancellor who has governed them for 16 years, after picking a song by the punk rocker Nina Hagen as the soundtrack for her military leaving ceremony.
Merkel, whose Social Democrat successor, Olaf Scholz, is expected to be sworn in as chancellor next week, will be given a customary military farewell in the courtyard outside the defence ministry on Thursday evening.
The Großer Zapfenstreich ceremony will be more low-key than usual because of coronavirus restrictions, with only 200 guests in attendance.
Like her predecessors, Merkel has been allowed to request three songs to be performed by a marching band during the military tattoo.
But whereas Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Kohl picked conventionally bombastic musical fare for the occasion – Frank Sinatra’s My Way and Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, among others – some of Merkel’s picks hint at uncharted hinterland.
Großer Gott, wir loben Dich (Holy God, we praise thy name) is a popular Christian hymn from the 18th century, a nod to her upbringing as the daughter of a Protestant pastor and the religious identity of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Her second choice, Hildegard Knef’s Für mich soll’s rote Rosen regnen (It should rain red roses for me), a wistful song about teenage ambition and juvenile arrogance, already suggests an ironic twinkle in the eye, however. “I was suppose to conform, make do,” the lyrics go. “Oh, I can’t conform, I can’t make do, I always want to win too.”
But the pick that had commentators searching for subtext and hidden messages is Nina Hagen’s Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen (You forgot the colour film).
First recorded in 1974 in a conventional schlager style, the song was a hit in the East German pop charts before Hagen emigrated to the other side of the iron curtain, where she immersed herself in London subcultures and became West Germany’s pre-eminent punk figure of the 1980s.
But even to embrace her East German identity is a move uncharacteristic of the Merkel her country has known during most of her 16 years in power, when she rarely brought her eastern upbringing to the fore.
The song, whose lyrics were written by Kurt Demmler, is an angry lament that admonishes Hagen’s boyfriend Michael for having only taken a black and white film on their holiday to Hiddensee island. As a result, she wails, “no one will believe how beautiful it was here”.
Though not censored by the state, the song was understood by its admirers at the time as a covert criticism of the socialist republic and its grey and drab everyday, where colour films were a rare commodity.
Some commentators have speculated whether the outgoing chancellor may have seen a more modern meaning in Hagen’s song: a howl of frustration with men neglecting to do their job properly could also be designed as a parting shot from Merkel to her male colleagues."

In Unterleuten, a bestselling novel by the German novelist Juli Zeh, the inhabitants of a village outside Berlin are shocked to find out that a plot of land on their doorstep has been earmarked for a gigantic wind farm.
One of the characters, a birdwatcher called Gerhard Fliess, knows what to do: he calls an old friend at the local environment ministry to remind him that the countryside around Unterleuten is the habitat of an endangered species of sandpiper. Surely that will halt the bulldozers.
His friend at the ministry has different ideas, however. “So what,” he comments wryly, “that’s the future.” Green policy made in Germany no longer just means protecting nesting wading birds, but unleashing business to build, build, build.
Zeh’s village saga, published in 2016 but recently turned into a television drama, could make for prophetic reading as Germany enters the post-Merkel era under a new government.
Viewed from outside the country, the three parties that are likely to fill the government benches from the second week of December make an odd match, even by the centrist standards of German coalition politics.
While the Social Democratic party (SPD) of future chancellor Olaf Scholz has showcased its ideological flexibility by acting as junior partner to Merkel’s conservatives for three out of her four terms, the two smaller parties enter government with agendas that seem almost diametrically opposed: a Green party that vows to protect the environment from Germany’s dirty industry, and a Free Democratic party (FDP) that wants to liberate industry from burdensome regulation.
“The three parties clearly agree that they want to see more progress but they are not necessarily pointing in the same direction,” said Wolfgang Merkel, a political scientist at Humboldt University in Berlin. “What is certain is that there will be collisions of interest along the way.”
With its leader, Christian Lindner, installed at the finance ministry, the debt-averse FDP will have a de-facto veto over the two centre-left parties’ spending plans. Conflicting agendas mean Germany’s next government already looks hamstrung in areas like tax reform, where the SPD and Greens want to increase rates and the FDP wants to slash them. As a result, they will feel pressure to unleash a flurry of activity in those areas where their ideas of change overlap.
The three parties want to liberalise archaic citizenship laws, streamline immigration, improve gay and transgender rights, lower the voting age to 16 and legalise the recreational use of cannabis. Lit up by this “traffic light” government, Germany may at last live up to the liberal billing that was often associated with Merkel’s name abroad, but less so at home.
In other areas, it may simply mean cutting red tape to speed up structural changes without having to reach too deeply into the state’s coffers.
The 173-page coalition agreement published on Wednesday contains variations of the term “unbureaucratic” or “de-bureaucratising” on every third page, vowing to “remove all hurdles and barriers” to ensure renewables account for 80% of the country’s gross electricity demand by 2030. In the hands of the liberal FDP, the justice ministry will see it as its job to ease this process.
Wind farms are to be built on at least 2% of each of the 16 German states’ lands – and sandpiper habitats will have to drop down the priority list to ensure that can happen.
Both the Greens and the FDP have been in government before: the ecological party acted as junior partner to Gerhard Schröder’s Social Democrats from 1998 to 2005, and the liberals shared power with Merkel’s Christian Democrats from 2009 to 2013. But the outlook of both parties has changed considerably since then, and they will use the next four years to show how.
The Green party has not only doubled its membership but also moved on from its pacifist roots on foreign policy. The new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has already signalled a more confrontational course with China and Russia. The coalition agreement calls on Brussels to take a tougher stance in its rule-of-law battles with states like Poland and Hungary, and backs the procurement of armed drones for the military.
The FDP, meanwhile, has pushed its libertarian tendencies to the fringes of the party. “They have moved on from being a neo-liberal party focused purely on the economy to again talk more about civil liberties and digitisation,” said Andrea Römmele, a professor of political communication at the Hertie School in Berlin. “They started playing that role during the corona crisis, and it went down well.”
Gone are the days of Genscherism, when the FDP envisioned Germany acting as a bridge between east and west. Last month, the liberal party called on German universities to cut their ties to the Confucius Institute, the academic network seen as an instrument for Beijing’s soft power.
The mission statements of the two smaller parties, who will have more seats in the Bundestag between them than the SPD, don’t sound too dissimilar on paper: to catch up on missed opportunities of the last decade and make Germany future-proof.
The Greens define sustainability ecologically, the FDP in economic terms. “The stories we want to tell are complementary,” said Karl-Heinz Paqué, the chair of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, an FDP-affiliated thinktank.
In finance minister Lindner and Green co-leader Robert Habeck, the new vice chancellor and climate-economy super-minister, they also have two politicians with rhetorical talent and an appetite for power to give a voice to these narratives.
For Scholz, the risk is that he will be reduced as chancellor to the role of the moderator while the two activist politicians to his left and right set the country’s agenda.
“The Greens and FDP are often portrayed as antagonists but there are plenty of similarities,” said Andreas Busch, a professor of political science at the University of Göttingen. “They are the ‘well off’ in German party politics, parties whose voters are highly educated and economically well-to-do.” It will likely fall on the centre-left to protect the rest of the country from the knock-on effects of the creative class’s campaign of creative destruction.
“The days in which a German chancellor sets the direction of travel and the government follows have been gone for some time,” said Wolfgang Merkel. “But that’s not to say that Scholz cannot copy the trick that Merkel played: to take the credit for their best ideas, and convert that into strong support for his party.”
To do so, Scholz will also have to fashion a public persona that sounds different to his predecessor. That much was apparent when the parties presented their deal on Wednesday: Lindner held forth freely and at length, while Habeck cut off SPD co-leader Saska Esken to tell her she had to wait her turn. Scholz, meanwhile, read out a scripted speech with a Merkel-esque, monotone delivery."

Confirmation that Germany will soon be governed by a three-party coalition led by the social democrat Olaf Scholz is an event to take seriously, and not just in Germany. That is especially true because once the coalition parties – social democrats, greens and liberals – have each voted their formal approval, Mr Scholz will take over from Angela Merkel, who has governed resourcefully for 16 years while providing great stability on the international stage.
Mrs Merkel’s departure means her centre-right CDU-CSU alliance faces a period of eclipse and reinvention. The new administration, dubbed the traffic-light coalition because of the parties’ colours, will, however, provide continuity with the recent past, especially in foreign, European and defence policy. More problematically, the new finance minister, Christian Lindner of the liberal Free Democratic party, is now positioned to uphold Germany’s familiar fiscal orthodoxy and debt aversion in the face of future spending pressures from the other coalition parties, as well as on the EU budgetary stage. To an extent, such tensions are implicit in any three-way coalition. These should neither be exaggerated nor downplayed. Yet the new government and the EU will not easily survive any hasty German return to traditional austerity and debt avoidance, so the commitments in the coalition deal may prove more aspirational than achievable. The investment pledges on infrastructure and climate crisis measures will also challenge the culture of budgetary restraint. Ultimately, the test of the Scholz government will be how it deals with these tensions.
Yet the coalition’s wider agenda, set out in the 178-page document hammered out since September’s general election, should not be dismissed as a steady-as-we-go programme. With the Green party heading a new ministry for economy and climate protection, targets will require 80% of electricity from renewables by 2030, the phasing out of coal “ideally” by the same deadline, and a sped-up abandonment of gas by 2040. Equally striking, especially seen from Britain, is the coalition’s pledge of a paradigm shift in migration and integration policy to make Germany “a modern country of immigration”. Promised measures include speeding up the visa process, easier passport entitlement and support for refugee quotas. Other important liberalisations include easing the process of gender change, lifting the ban on the sale of cannabis for recreational use and reducing the voting age from 18 to 16.
Old party loyalties are breaking down across Europe, not just Germany, so this coalition should be watched as a possible shape of things to come. As ever, though, the best laid plans are vulnerable to immediate events. Germany’s Covid rates have hit record levels this month, and contentious lockdowns and compulsory vaccinations are on the agenda in some states.

Most Germans will be “vaccinated, cured or dead” from Covid-19 in a few months, the country’s health minister has warned, as Germany’s southern neighbour Austria put its population of 8.9 million back under a nationwide lockdown.
As intensive care units near capacity and hospitals contend with a shortage of staff and respiratory apparatus, doctors have said they are ready to apply a triage system that would prioritise care for patients judged to have the best chance of survival.
“Probably by the end of the winter, more or less everyone in Germany will be vaccinated, cured or dead,” the health minister, Jens Spahn, said. “That sounds cynical, but that is the reality.”
Spahn said the highly contagious Delta variant made his prediction very probable and that was why the government was so urgently recommending vaccination.
The outgoing chancellor, Angela Merkel, told leaders of her conservative party that measures being taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus were insufficient and that stronger action needed to be taken. “We are in a highly dramatic situation. What is in place now is not sufficient,” she told CDU leaders in a meeting, according to Reuters.
In Austria, the seven-day Covid incidence rate has hit a record 1,107 in every 100,000 people and more than 3,000 patients are reportedly in hospital with Covid. In Germany the figure is 409.2, and the UK’s is 422.7.
Under the terms of its lockdown, people are only allowed to leave home to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. Schools are open but parents have been urged to keep their children at home wherever possible. Working from home is also recommended. Austria is also imposing a sweeping vaccine mandate from 1 February – joining the Vatican as the only places in Europe with such a requirement.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to protest over the measures, some blaming the government for not doing more to avert the latest coronavirus wave crashing into Europe.
Across Germany, a variety of measures have been introduced at the regional level to try to curb the spread of the virus, such as excluding unvaccinated people or those without antibodies from non-essential facilities and public spaces.
In the worst-hit regions of Bavaria and Saxony, authorities have ordered bars and clubs to shut and Christmas markets, which were due to open this week, have been cancelled. But Merkel said neither those measures nor a higher uptake of vaccinations would be enough to halt the rapid rise of infections in the short run. She called on Germany’s 16 federal states to decide on tough measures by Wednesday.
The possibility of reintroducing a national lockdown in Germany has not been ruled out. A debate over whether or not to introduce a vaccine mandate is also in full flow.
Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat MP, called for a “radical” application of rules requiring people to present vaccination or recovery certificates to access some shops and public places. “A general vaccine mandate [shouldn’t be] taboo either,” he wrote on Twitter.
Lothar Wieler, the head of the disease control agency the Robert Koch Institute, described a mandate as a “measure of last resort” but did not rule out recommending one. A spokesperson for the outgoing government said it would leave the decision to the incoming administration.
Last week, the leaders of Germany’s 16 regional states agreed they wanted a law requiring health workers and those working with elderly and vulnerable people to get Covid vaccines.
About 68% of Germans and 66% of Austrians are fully vaccinated, which virologists and epidemiologists agree is not high enough to keep the pandemic under control.
Spahn made his blunt remark after he had been forced to defend his decision to call on the nation’s doctors to use up existing stocks of the Moderna vaccine before it expired, despite patients’ overwhelming preference for the BioNTech/Pfizer jab, which was developed in Germany.
Doctors administering booster shots have reported that some patients turned down the Moderna jabs, fearing they were of inferior quality or would offer less protection if their first jab had been of BioNTech/Pfizer. Spahn said both vaccines worked well and stressed there was no shortage of vaccines.
“Some vaccinating doctors say BioNTech is the Mercedes of the vaccines and Moderna is the Rolls-Royce,” he said. Both use the same core mRNA technology.
He was backed up by Klaus Cichutek, president of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, the government regulatory body for vaccines, who said Germans failed to recognise how lucky they were. “We’re living here in paradise,” he said. “There are enough vaccines, and they are safe and effective … It’s not proportionate to be fighting about which mRNA vaccine should be used. The message of the moment is far more that everyone should get vaccinated.”
Austria’s chancellor, Alexander Schallenberg, has scheduled 20 days for the lockdown, with an evaluation after 10 days.
Rows have erupted between scientists and politicians in Austria and Germany. Markus Söder, the leader of Bavaria, criticised scientists for failing to warn of the severity of the situation. Leading scientists have hit back, saying they never ceased to emphasise how the pandemic was likely to escalate without mass immunisation."

The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has acknowledged that his troops probably helped Middle Eastern asylum seekers cross into Europe, in the clearest admission yet that he engineered the new migrant crisis on the border with the EU.
In an interview with the BBC at his presidential palace in Minsk, he said it was “absolutely possible” that his troops helped migrants across the frontier into Poland.
“Maybe someone helped them. I won’t even look into this,” he said.
He denied being responsible for the migrant crisis but admitted to letting asylum seekers through Belarus to the EU’s borders “because they’re not coming to my country, they’re going to yours”.
Belarusian state media teased the interview on Friday as Lukashenko has sought to showcase his direct contacts with western leaders and media despite his increasing international isolation. “You know perfectly well it’s going to be interesting,” a state media Telegram channel wrote, saying Lukashenko had spoken with a “major western news outlet”. Representatives of the opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya criticised the interview as “giving the floor to a dictator”, the broadcaster reported. Lukashenko also gave an interview to CNN in September.
In the BBC interview, Lukashenko also admitted that his security services severely beat people who had been imprisoned for protesting against tainted elections last year.
“OK, OK, I admit it, I admit it. People were beaten in the Okrestina detention centre. But there were police beaten up too and you didn’t show this,” he said.
Human Rights Watch last year said it had spoken to detainees who described “beatings, prolonged stress positions, electric shocks, and, in at least one case, rape, and said they saw other detainees suffer the same or worse abuse. They had serious injuries, including broken bones, cracked teeth, skin wounds, electrical burns, and mild traumatic brain injuries. Some had kidney damage”.
EU governments have refused to recognise Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus because of the crackdown on the opposition last year. Earlier this week, he had his first direct contact with an EU leader since the election when he spoke by telephone with Angela Merkel about humanitarian aid for the thousands of asylum seekers trapped at the border.
The outdoor migrant camps on the EU border were emptied of people this week as Belarus moved thousands of asylum seekers to a logistics centre near the border. Videos showed that small fights had broken out at the centre, which was reported to be overcrowded. Lukashenko on Friday ordered his ministers to improve security at the centre, his press service said.
The Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatović, on Friday called for Poland to allow human rights groups and journalists to access the border region to “end human suffering and violations of human rights”. Poland has declared a state of emergency on its borders with Belarus, giving police extraordinary authority to expel refugees without reviewing applications for asylum.
This article was amended on 20 November 2021. In an earlier version, Dunja Mijatović was described as the EU’s human rights commissioner, rather than the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner."

The head of Germany’s disease control agency has said the country is heading for a “very bad Christmas season” if drastic measures are not taken to dampen the spread of coronavirus.
Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said that even if measures were taken Germany faced a period of “extremely dismal days” during which hundreds of people would die out of those currently infected.
The RKI reported about 65,000 new infections on Thursday, the ninth day in a row that a record for the pandemic has been set. Wieler said the true figure was likely to be at least two or three times as high.
He urged Germany to increase its vaccination rate, including of booster doses, ban large gatherings and reduce social contacts. He also recommended the closure of indoor venues such as bars and nightclubs.
Angela Merkel, the outgoing chancellor, called the situation “dramatic” earlier in the week, saying the fourth wave was “hitting our country with full force”.
Tighter regional regulations have been introduced across Germany in recent days, the most extreme of which limit access to nonessential facilities such as restaurants or fitness centres to people who are vaccinated or can prove they have recovered from the disease. In addition to the documentation, people will have to show a negative test result.
In neighbouring Austria, the hardest-hit areas of Upper Austria and Salzburg were preparing for a full-scale lockdown and the government was facing growing calls to extend the move nationally, having introduced a lockdown for just the unvaccinated on Monday. Austria has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, at 66%.
France will not follow suit, said president Emmanuel Macron, who argued that the country’s health pass had been successful in curbing the spread of the virus.
“Those countries locking down the non-vaccinated are those which have not put in place the [health] pass. Therefore this step is not necessary in France,” Macron told La Voix du Nord newspaper in an interview published late on Thursday.
Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 states on Thursday agreed to introduce a vaccine mandate for workers in care homes and hospitals.
The Bundestag also approved measures that were put forward by the three parties likely to make up the next government requiring people to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative Covid test for workplaces and public transport.
The three parties, however, decided against extending the legal framework introduced 20 months ago that allowed the federal government to be able to take nationwide action to deal with the pandemic. Instead, Germany’s 16 states will have the power to introduce new protective measures.
Critics led by the conservatives (CDU/CSU) of Merkel’s outgoing government said it amounted to a reduction in restrictions, would create a confusing hotchpotch of rules and would give the impression that the virus was under control.
The vote was seen as the first big test of the three-way administration’s ability to manage the pandemic when it comes into office next month. In a heated parliamentary debate, the outgoing government was accused of taking its hands off the wheel, particularly over vaccine promotion.
Some members of the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) were unable to sit in the main hall of the Bundestag and were required to sit in the public gallery instead as they have refused to show their vaccine or recovery documents or to undergo tests.
The rise in cases is put down to a combination of factors including Germany’s vaccine rate of less than 68%, a sluggish booster jab campaign, the Delta variant of the virus and an expeditious return to normal social mixing, as well as to a lack of staff in hospitals, which has led to fewer beds being available on intensive care wards.
Swift administration of vaccines to give half of Germans a booster jab by Christmas would mean administering 5.6m doses a week. Under current circumstances, including a lack of vaccine centres, this is viewed as unrealistic.
Wieler said ICU units were already close to being overwhelmed, and people needing to be given emergency medical treatment after car accidents, heart attacks and strokes were no longer guaranteed the level of care that would normally be available.
“People who won’t get a vaccine need to know this,” he said, adding that 15 million German adults remained unvaccinated.
He said those who were being admitted to ICU were far more likely to be unvaccinated and increasingly likely to have to be put on an artificial lung, seen as a last-resort measure. They were also having to stay longer on average compared with earlier in the pandemic, owing to an increase in severity of the disease.
“We have never been so unsettled as we are now,” he said. “We’re really facing a very bad Christmas season if we don’t do something about it.”
On Thursday the vaccine advisory body Stiko recommended booster jabs for everyone over the age of 18, to be administered six months or less after their last dose.
The health ministry said it expected that 9.2 million children between the ages of five and 11 could receive vaccinations before Christmas if, as expected, the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is given approval for that age group from regulatory authorities in the EU and Germany in the coming days."

As migrants camped out in the woods prepared for another night of sub-zero temperatures, the Estonian foreign minister, Eva-Maria Liimets, on Tuesday revealed to an evening news programme the gist of what Alexander Lukashenko demanded of Angela Merkel in the first call between a European leader and Belarus’s dictator in more than a year.
“He wants the sanctions to be halted, [and] to be recognised as head of state so he can continue,” she said he told Merkel.
It was never much of a secret what Lukashenko wanted, but indications of an effective quid pro quo proposed to the German leader are nonetheless stunning. Even more surprising are the lengths that Lukashenko had gone to deliver that message.
In the last year, the Belarusian leader has gone from something of a nuisance on Europe’s borders to a far greater threat, one who grounds Ryanair flights or engineers migrant crises on Europe’s borders on a whim. And yet, Lukashenko appears to remain convinced that his best way out of trouble is to escalate further, desperate to resume contact with Europe by becoming ever more repellant.
To a certain degree, he can claim to have succeeded. Merkel called Lukashenko for a second time on Wednesday. His press service said that the two sides had agreed to hold direct talks with the EU on solving the crisis and that Merkel had passed on a request from the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, to allow international organisations to provide aid.
This is the kind of attention that Lukashenko, who has been blacklisted since he brutally crushed his opposition in 2020, has craved. (His spokesperson has denied that he brought up sanctions or his recognition as president during the talks.) The talks have riled top officials in the governments of countries that border Lukashenko. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said he would not recognise any deals cut “over our heads”.
“No serious leader has spoken with Lukashenko so far,” he said, promising Poland would enforce its sovereignty “ruthlessly”.
But fundamentally, Lukashenko’s gambit has appeared a miscalculation. Europe has shown that it is ready to back Poland, despite concern over its extreme border measures, to show Minsk that it cannot be blackmailed. New sanctions have been confirmed that will drive Belarus further into isolation, leaving Putin as Lukashenko’s only real lifeline.
And European leaders will not be extorted to recognise a leader whose “gangster-style tactics” have created its worst border crisis in decades. “In our view, it is important that the European Union remains united and exerts its influence on Belarus through action,” said Liimets.
The Belarusian leader’s endgame remains opaque. “He is not afraid of deaths at the border,” noted a panel of experts from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “For him, this is about vengeance and is a matter of regime survival – meaning that he is ready to escalate further, and to seek Russia’s backing in the process.”
On Wednesday alone, Belarus said it would temporarily need to limit oil supplies to Poland and suspend electricity deliveries to Ukraine. The government has claimed both are due to technical issues.
On the other hand, it may be as good a time as any for him to declare victory. On Wednesday, the Kremlin hailed Lukashenko’s talks with Merkel, calling them “very important”. Belarus’s main press agency has crowed about the new talks with Brussels, despite a lack of confirmation from European officials.
And in the past day, Belarus has begun housing as many as 1,000 migrants in a transport and logistics facility, allowing state and foreign journalists to film officials delivering asylum-seekers a hot meal delivered by the same government that helped to engineer the crisis.
For a Belarusian leader deeper and deeper in disfavour, this may be as good as it gets."

Angela Merkel has called on unvaccinated Germans to get their shots as quickly as possible as the country’s coronavirus infection rate hit the latest in a string of new highs.
Germany’s disease control centre said the country’s infection rate had climbed to 277.4 new cases per 100,000 residents over seven days, up from 263.7 the previous day.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 45,081 new infections, two days after the daily total topped 50,000 for the first time.
Another 228 Covid-19 deaths brought Germany’s total in the pandemic so far to 97,617.
Speaking in her weekly podcast, the outgoing German chancellor said: “If we stand together, if we think about protecting ourselves and caring for others, we can save our country a lot this winter.”
She warned that that there were “very difficult weeks ahead of us”.
While the infection rate is not yet as high as in some other European countries, its relentless rise in Germany has set off alarm bells.
Merkel plans to meet the country’s 16 state governors to coordinate nationwide measures next week, and parliament is mulling legislation that would provide a new legal framework for restrictions over the winter.
Merkel expressed her concern about the high number of intensive care patients and rising death numbers – especially in regions with low vaccination rates.
“Think about it again,” Merkel said to those who still had not got the jab. “We just need to grab it, grab it fast.
“I am asking you: join us, and try to convince relatives and friends as well,” she added.
The chancellor also called on those who are vaccinated already to get a booster shot against Covid. The booster vaccinations are “a real chance to break the severe fall and winter wave of the pandemic,” Merkel said.
Germany has struggled to bring new momentum to its vaccination campaign lately, with a bit over two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated. Children under the age of 12, who cannot yet get vaccinated in Germany, are among the worst hit group.
The head of the German Teachers’ Association warned on Saturday that local health offices were struggling to keep control amid the many outbreaks in schools across the country.
“The reality is that we are already on the verge of losing control in some hotspot areas,” Heinz-Peter Meidinger told weekly paper Welt am Sonntag. “We no longer know how to contain infection outbreaks in schools.”
Also on Saturday, the government started offering free rapid Covid tests again. They were scrapped a month ago in an effort to persuade more people to get vaccinated."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/12/merkel-star-doppelganger-germany-ursula-wanecki;2021-11-12;Blazers out, nail varnish in: as Merkel steps down, so does star doppelganger;"Ursula Wanecki's second life as an impersonator started almost by accident. Sixteen years later, she is hanging up the blazers
Ursula Wanecki has a dream, which is to finally meet Angela Merkel and swap tips with her about how to make Silesian plum cake. “I know for a fact she likes to make it, with a crumble topping. I imagine us sitting in her garden, having a coffee and eating the cake – with a crunchy crumble – away from the public eye.”
She has been told “by people in the know”, she says, that her idea is not so far-fetched. Merkel knows about Wanecki, who has been impersonating her for almost as long as she has been chancellor, and has even sent her a signed book, which Wanecki takes to be tacit approval of her unconventional role.
Her public presence as Germany’s leading Merkel double in everything from satirical TV shows and supermarket openings to private weddings and birthday parties has kept her busy over the past 16 years, even as she calls it her “hobby” and has retained her day job as an assistant tax consultant. When Merkel, 67, retires from her role next month, 65-year-old Wanecki plans to do the same.
“What I’m looking forward to most is being able to wear nail varnish and big earrings again, something Merkel never does,” she jokes. “But I think that ditching the blazers will not mean people don’t continue to shout ‘Hallo Angie’ at me for some time to come. She will not disappear from the public consciousness for some time.”
Her second life started almost by accident, with absolutely no effort on her part, Wanecki said in a recent online interview from her modest three-room flat in Attendorn, west Germany.
“When he was very young my grandson saw Angela Merkel on the TV news and told his mum: ‘That’s granny.’ Then I wore an apricot-coloured suit at a wedding, something similar to what she had worn – the colour suits us both – and later dressed as her for a laugh to go to carnival. And it went down so well that it took off from there.”
She is indeed more or less Merkel’s spitting image, mimicking her down to her slightly stooped posture, even her cautious gait and sometimes childlike glee.
In a compelling series of sketches made for a popular TV show, in which she copies Merkel undertaking everyday tasks ranging from drawing money from a bank machine to throwing a stick for a dog, she has Merkel’s cautionary approach down to a T as she hesitates before stepping on to an escalator.
“But I swear I never learned the mimicry. It is truly how I am. I hardly need to make any effort, I just put on a bit of makeup and an oversized blazer and when I walk out the door I am simply Angela Merkel,” she said.
Despite being taller “by a head” and having a shoe size of 40, compared with Merkel’s 38, as well as “longer, slimmer legs”, she says most people fail to notice the difference, “especially if they’ve never seen Merkel in the flesh”.
Wanecki was born in Poland and despite having lived in Germany for years, has a strong Polish accent. “Therefore I am the necessarily quiet chancellor,” she said. “I arrive somewhere in a limousine, walk up the red carpet, hold my hands in her trademark rhomboid position. There’s a gasp when people first see me – the shock effect is what’s most important. But as soon as I open my mouth, the secret is out. Sometimes I’ve joked that I’ve spent too long speaking to Vladimir Putin and his accent’s rubbed off. That almost always draws a laugh.”
She has an agent who deals with impersonation requests, who has seen demand grow steadily over the years, reaching its peak in the recent, last months of Merkel’s fourth term. In October Wanecki took part in a feature film, though she is not allowed to go into detail. She has also starred in numerous films and tableaux by the British photographer and film-maker Alison Jackson, who specialises in faux scenarios using celebrity lookalikes, after the artist issued an appeal in the German media for a Merkel doppelganger.
Wanecki made the cover of Le Monde in Jackson’s 2013 depiction of the revival of the Franco-German alliance, eating croissants and bretzels with François Hollande. She even made headlines once, a few years ago, after appearing in an advert for a new magazine for gay women, in which Merkel appeared to be in an intimate setting with another woman in what the magazine’s editor said was an attempt to win a reluctant Merkel over to support same-sex marriage.
“I come from a strict Catholic family and I had had absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality,” Wanecki said. “But after I was approached by the magazine I started to do my homework and realised what an important topic it was.” But she was unprepared for the reaction that followed. “The furore around it throughout the world was extraordinary. I think it might even have helped Merkel change her mind about gay marriage.”
Merkel did not in fact vote in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in 2017, but she made no attempt to block it and subsequently said she supported the parliamentary approval it received.
Wanecki has also turned down plenty of offers, in particular, she said, if they appeared disrespectful towards a woman she described warmly as “clever, thorough and an excellent crisis manager”. These included a Russian TV advert for an underwear company, “and various other lurid invitations”.
Among the personal highlights was a trip to Greece at the height of the euro crisis to star in an ad in which she had to dip her hand into a barrel of olives and declare: “This is Greek gold with which Greece will manage to clear its debts.”
The low points came during the migrant crisis of 2015, when she was showered with offensive remarks while on assignments after welcoming refugees fleeing conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.
“That was the first time I felt scared about being mistaken for her,” she said. “And to be frank, the fear has never left me. I always take care, even in my home town, when I’m walking down the street to see who else is nearby. If someone comes up behind me unawares, I’m easily alarmed. In Berlin when I’m standing at the top of a flight of stairs with my suitcase, I always wait until it is clear before hugging the railing and walking down, in case someone tries to shove into me. There are a lot of crazy people out there who maybe want the chance to make the headlines.”
Soon Wanecki plans to hang up the blazers. She fancies a cruise and to explore more of her native Poland. “It was important for me in all the years to not lose the essence of Ursula Wanecki, the real me,” she said. “I hope that the same goes for Angela Merkel.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/10/polish-pm-blames-vladimir-putin-for-belarus-border-crisis;2021-11-10;Merkel appeals to Putin to intervene in Belarus border crisis;"Call comes after Polish PM said Russia was behind flow of people from Middle East to EU borders
Angela Merkel has asked Vladimir Putin to intervene in the crisis on the Belarus-Poland border in an appeal to Minsk’s key foreign sponsor as the EU prepared a new set of sanctions against Belarus.
In a phone call on a crisis that has escalated dramatically since Monday, when 1,000 people mainly from Iraqi Kurdistan arrived on the border, the German chancellor told Putin that the “use of migrants by the Belarusian regime was inhuman and unacceptable and asked [Putin] to influence the regime in Minsk”, according to the chancellor’s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, who described the situation as “state-sanctioned human trafficking”.
The conversation came hours after Poland’s prime minister accused the Russian president of “masterminding” the surging numbers and underlined the role that regional alliances were playing in the standoff and ensuing humanitarian crisis. Thousands of people are in the forests along the border, where temperatures fall below zero after nightfall.
Russia has denied any involvement and blamed Europe. The Kremlin readout of the phone call with Merkel said Putin “proposed to establish a discussion of the [current] problems in direct contacts between representatives of the EU member states and Minsk”. It did not mention Merkel’s request that Putin intervene or promise any action from Russia to end the crisis.
But Moscow sent a potent message of support for Minsk on Wednesday as it dispatched a pair of nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers on a patrol mission over Belarus. The Russian defence ministry called the rare deployment of the strategic bombers a preparedness check of Russia and Belarus’s joint air defence network.
Poland and neighbouring Lithuania have declared a state of emergency on their borders with Belarus, where the authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has been accused of ferrying asylum seekers from the Middle East to the EU’s borders as revenge for the bloc’s criticism of his crackdown on opposition.
After a meeting of EU diplomats in Brussels on Wednesday, about 30 individuals and entities are facing sanctions, most likely including Belarus’s national air carrier, Belavia, and travel agencies. A full list of those to be targeted is expected to be finalised by the end of the week, then confirmed on Monday and brought into force next month.
The EU has already imposed sanctions on 166 individuals tied to the Belarusian regime, including Lukashenko and his son, since the president embarked on a campaign of repression against opponents in order to stay in power after disputed elections last August, including forcing the landing of a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a dissident.
An option to include Turkish Airlines and Russia’s Aeroflot in the sanctions regime for bringing people into Belarus from the Middle East was discussed but sources played down the likelihood of a decision being taken that would widen the scope of the crisis.
The arrival of more than 1,000 people, many from Iraqi Kurdistan, at the Polish border on Monday brought the crisis to a head, with the EU accusing Belarus of a “hybrid attack”. Polish border guards said on Wednesday that two groups of several dozen people had breached the borders overnight. They were arrested and expelled, they said. Lithuanian border guards said they had prevented 281 attempts to cross the border illegally on Tuesday.
Charles Michel, the European Council president, said during a visit to Warsaw on Wednesday that Belarus’s actions were unacceptable. “Possible sanctions are on the table … and we want to make sure that we coordinate with all the member states in order to make the best possible choices and to identify what are the best possible tools in order to be effective. It must stop, this hybrid attack against the EU,” he said.
Poland’s accusations against Russia, the most direct yet in a crisis in which the Kremlin has not played a direct role, came amid an extraordinary session of parliament on Tuesday as the prime minister called Putin an “enabler” of Lukashenko.
“This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow. The mastermind is President Putin,” Mateusz Morawiecki said in the Sejm, Poland’s lower house of parliament, which is dominated by the rightwing Law and Justice party.
Morawiecki said Putin was determined to “rebuild the Russian empire” and called the crisis at the border “a new kind of war, in which people are used as living shields”.
Moscow has been an increasingly crucial ally for Belarus in the past year as the EU has pushed Minsk further into isolation.
On Tuesday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said western countries including EU member states, and Nato, were the “root” of the crisis. “They were pushing for a western-style better life and democracy the way it is interpreted by the west,” he said, referring to US-led interventions and alleged western backing for the Arab spring.
Belarusian travel agencies are accused of issuing visas and bringing in hundreds of people from Iraq, Syria and other countries to Minsk, from where they then travel west to try to cross the border and from Poland pass on to Germany. Many of the airlines are either Belarusian or based in the Middle East.
Asked whether Germany would take in migrants unilaterally, Merkel’s spokesperson said the question was “irrelevant”. A spokesperson for the German interior ministry said if Belarus did not provide humanitarian aid, then the European Union needed to do so, not just one member state.

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/03/the-chancellor-by-kati-marton-review-in-search-of-angela-merkel;2021-11-03;The Chancellor by Kati Marton review – in search of Angela Merkel;"A diligent attempt to uncover the private life and motivations of Germany’s first female head of government
Angela Merkel’s marathon tenure as Germany’s leader may have officially crossed the finishing line with September’s federal elections, but her final lap of honour could take some time. Depending on the pace of coalition talks between the politicians hoping to fill her shoes, she may yet give one more of her annual TV addresses in a caretaker capacity this Christmas.
Still, as a new generation of German leaders rises to the fore and Merkel recedes into the background, the contours of her legacy are becoming easier to distinguish. There are quantifiable historic firsts: 16 years in office make her the joint longest-serving chancellor of the postwar era, equalling the record of her former mentor Helmut Kohl. She’s the first German chancellor to have the wisdom to step down of her own will, at the end of a full term.
She’s the first female German head of government, the first with a scientist’s training, and the first to have grown up in a socialist command economy. She may go down in history as a once-in-a-century political adaptor, connecting two differently hardwired systems kept apart by the Berlin Wall.
Yet it’s also possible that Merkel may not be remembered as a pioneer, but as the last example of an idea that feels increasingly old-fashioned in an age where more and more political tribes are built around personal identity: leadership as an exercise in ego suppression, holding high office as tantamount to covering the very traits that make you unique.
Hungarian-American author Kati Marton is especially fascinated by this aspect of Merkel’s tenure: the intense privacy of a woman who rose to power in an era of oversharing.
“After several decades, Germans are not tired of her image, her voice, her looming persona – because Merkel does not loom,” Marton writes in her biography, in response to the German leader’s enduringly high popularity ratings. “Despite knowing little about their chancellor’s private life, other than that she comes across as leading a life not so different from their own, Germans thrice reelected her, each time by a comfortable margin.”
From Marton’s US perspective, the contrast is especially glaring: while Donald Trump’s stint in the White House became a reality TV show, broadcast in real time through tweets and continual leaks, Merkel’s chancellory is famously gossip proof. Marton writes that her obsession with privacy “verges on paranoia”. The world was privy to Trump’s every idle thought via Twitter; Merkel, however, keeps no journal, does not use email, and “texts only briefly and when necessary”. Her long-standing, mostly female set of advisers is not only intensely loyal but almost invisible to the media’s eye.
Those who have been unwise enough to blab found themselves banished from her inner circle: one political ally, Marton writes, was never allowed back into Merkel’s confidence after releasing a four-word email with the following explosive content: “Thanks for the suggestion, AM.”
Few Germans are even aware that their chancellor has a sister and a brother, because they lead ordinary lives doing ordinary jobs and never speak to the press. Her first husband, Ulrich Merkel, whose surname she kept after their divorce in 1982, once gave a reluctant on-the-spot interview in which he praised his ex for her stance during the refugee crisis of 2015.
Perhaps after Merkel has left office proper there will be a biography that will lift the veil on her private motivations; Marton’s diligently compiled but often overtly reverential chronological overview is not it. In spite of numerous interviews with close advisers, touted as “circumventing the chancellor’s extraordinary need for control”, there are few revelations here that cast a new light on her leadership.
Marton notes how Merkel was the daughter of a Protestant pastor and the former head of a party with the word “Christian” in its name. She believes her “private faith, and the Bible, would steady her sometimes rocky path”, as well as provide a connection with the first US president she met in office, George W Bush. She may well be right, but this book doesn’t present any evidence to back up that claim, nor does it explore how Merkel’s specifically East German Lutheran brand of Christianity may have influenced her.
Marton believes Merkel to be a feminist, even if the chancellor herself only used the term to describe herself for the first time last month (in a panel discussion with the the novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). But as with her East German background, the chancellor’s sex was never converted into a policy priority. In fact, little of Germany’s progress on gender equality over the last 16 years can be directly put down to Merkel’s leadership: she initially opposed her labour minister Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal for legally mandated gender quotas for senior management positions.
At times, there is a slightly comical sense that the qualities Merkel’s biographer finds most intriguing are also those that most elude her: Marton, who also grew up east of the Iron Curtain and went on to become an ABC News foreign correspondent and marry the influential late US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, cannot help but slide her own story into the footnotes. Not quite the lesson one would have expected a writer to draw from studying a politician who managed to command authority by leaning out rather than in.
In one aside, Marton mentions that she once met Merkel at a lunch party hosted by the film director Volker Schlöndorff in September 2001, long before she started her biography. The writer Susan Sontag was also in attendance, she reveals, though sadly her memory of what words passed between the two women is sketchy. The pair were “a study in contrasts”, apparently: “Sontag, expansive; Merkel, the active listener.”
Perhaps while we wait for Merkel’s inner circle to go public and help produce the first truly illuminating biography of her tenure, we need storytellers to fill in the gaps. A chamber play on love, life and the way we live now featuring Merkel and Sontag: now that would be revelatory.

Being a royal has probably never been tougher, as Princess Mako of Japan, a niece of Emperor Naruhito and daughter of Crown Prince Akishino, might complain if she weren’t so well brought up. Mako married the love of her life, Kei Komuro, last week. But rather than celebrate a fairytale romance, the Japanese public sniffed disapproval.
Komuro is a commoner with a mildly unconventional background who once briefly sported a ponytail. This caused a national trauma. Traditionally-minded Japanese were scandalised. To get her man, Mako had to renounce her royal title and become plain Mrs. Even so, opinion in Tokyo is deeply conflicted about modern royalty.
Amid a chronic dearth of royal male heirs, polls suggest most Japanese would scrap the age-old rule barring women from the Chrysanthemum Throne. About 80% support Princess Aiko, Naruhito’s 19-year-old daughter, as future empress. And while Komuro may not be quite the thing, many back Mako’s right to make her own choice without being regally debagged.
Like the dysfunctional family of media mogul Logan Roy in the HBO hit series Succession, Japan’s imperial family faces a succession crisis. Other royal households are in turmoil, too, as popular expectations and changed notions of duty fuel internal power struggles. King Abdullah of Jordan, for example, recently uncovered a Gulf-backed coup plot involving his half-brother, former Crown Prince Hamzah.
More shocking still, if Saad Aljabri, a prominent defector, is to be believed, Saudi Arabia’s “psychopathic” Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the well-known Geordie, contemplated a Macbeth-style regicide in 2014. A Russian poison ring was the ghostly dagger equivalent, Aljabri claimed last week. Imagine Kendall Roy with sandals and a beard.
In Thailand, the fitness for the highest office of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016, continues to be disputed. Channelling Caligula, Vajiralongkorn, a thrice-divorced playboy, once promoted his pet poodle to air chief marshal. Eat your heart out, Roman Roy.
King Philip VI of Spain also has his worries in a country with an annoying habit of abolishing the monarchy. His father, Juan Carlos, abdicated in 2014 to spend more time with his mistresses, but scandal dogs him still. Last week, parliament was told the exiled ex-monarch was injected with female hormones to control his sex drive.
Britain’s increasingly fragile royals are not immune to family upheavals and changing mores, as the Harry-Meghan saga shows. The Queen’s recent indisposition may revive arguments over the succession. Prince Charles, 72, is first in line, but some unkindly suggest his eldest son, Prince William, is a more up-to-date replacement. Others urge a republican revolution.
Royal successions typically raise fundamental questions: what is a monarchy for? Can it co-exist with democracy? Do sovereigns give value for money? Norway’s royals, for example, live a commendably frugal existence on £37.5m a year. They own nine homes – and occasionally travel on public transport!
In contrast, Britain’s royals own 26 palaces, castles and estates, cost at least twice as much, and think the Tube is something on social media.
Ruling families that adopt the hereditary principle, without actually being royals, also suffer succession stress. Their legitimacy, such as it is, derives from power, not blood or history. North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung, his son, Kim Jong-il, and grandson, Kim Jong-un, together made autocracy a family business – a sort of “Dictators ‘R’ Us”. But proletarian paradise was rocked in 2017 when Kim Jong-un’s embarrassing older brother, Kim Jong-nam, a Disneyland fan once considered heir to the Hermit Kingdom, was publicly assassinated. Even so, Kim Jong-un may yet face another usurper: his ambitious, slimmer sister, Kim Yo-jong.
Syrians rightly fear that their homicidal president, Bashar al-Assad, son of former president Hafez al-Assad (another mass murderer), is grooming his teenage son, also named Hafez, as killer-in-chief. Similarly, Tajikistan’s Stalin-esque leader since 1992, Emomali Rahmon, is fast-tracking his son, Rustam, to absolutist glory.
Not to be outdone, Uganda’s big man, Yoweri Museveni, accused of serial electoral fraud and systemic human rights abuses during his 35-year reign, is reportedly lining up his son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, for elections due in 2026.
Benign or otherwise, familial political dynasty-building is common in established democracies, too. Indira Gandhi, India’s third prime minister, was followed in public life by her son, Rajiv, his wife, Sonia, and now by their son, Rahul Gandhi. In the US, Jack, Bobby, and Teddy Kennedy built a celebrity brand. In Italy, a new Mussolini holds power in Rome.
Yet high-recognition names don’t always bring successful successions. In 2016, Jeb Bush failed miserably to emulate his brother, George W, and their father, George HW Bush, in winning the US presidency. Donald Trump is said to hope his daughter, Ivanka, will eventually follow him to the White House – but that’s a nightmare for another day.
Europe’s most powerful leader, Angela Merkel, made a mighty schlamassel (mess) of Germany’s political succession. First she backed a protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer – but she flopped badly. Then she threw her weight behind jolly Armin Laschet in September’s election, only to watch him crash to record defeat.
This month saw Russia’s first royal wedding since the Bolshevik revolution. But the name of the groom – Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov, a descendant of Tsar Nicholas II, another Romanov – is not enough to regain the throne. Party-pooper Vladimir Putin, Russia’s ersatz tsar, saltily declined to congratulate the happy couple.
If one thing’s worse than a succession battle, it’s having no heir at all. Take China. Its leader, Xi Jinping, is now so terrifyingly omnipotent that the comrades dare not even dream of a successor. But what happens if (celestial heavens forbid) Xi falls under the proverbial Shanghai trolley-bus? Better ask Logan Roy."

Angela Merkel will bring her likely successor as German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, along to bilateral meetings on the fringe of this weekend’s G20 summit, in a “historic” gesture to emphasise continuity between the outgoing and incoming governments.
Social Democrat Scholz, who is conducting coalition talks to form a power-sharing deal with the German Greens and the Free Democratic party (FDP), is expected to attend bilateral meetings with the US president, Joe Biden, and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as well as the heads of state or government of Argentina, Singapore, India and South Korea.
There are also plans for a four-way meeting on Iran between Germany, the US, France and Britain. For the leaders of the G20 nations, the summit will be their first face-to-face meeting in two years. To the disappointment of the host, Italy, the leaders of China, Japan, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia have declined to attend in person.
Spokespeople for Scholz, who was already due to travel to Rome in his finance minister role, declined to deny the reported plans.
The joint appearance was designed to signal “a lot of continuity in the G20 process”, Frankfurter Allgemeine reported, citing government circles. It was a “historic thing” for “the predecessor to pop up with her successor”, the newspaper’s source said.
Though Scholz has served as vice-chancellor and finance minister in Merkel’s last government, the two politicians hail from traditionally rival parties, and in the election campaign before September’s national vote Merkel had insisted there was a “huge difference” between her and Scholz.
Olaf Scholz
The finance minister and deputy chancellor in Merkel’s last government, has been an influential player in German politics since 2002, when he became the centre-left Social Democratic Party’s general secretary under Gerhard Schröder.
A former labour lawyer and deputy leader of the SPD’s then anti-capitalist Young Socialist youth wing, the taciturn 63-year-old has for most of his career been associated with the party’s right: as senator for the interior and then mayor of Hamburg, he often pursued strict law and order policies and continued the mercantilist traditions of the rich port city in Germany’s north.
In the federal finance ministry, Scholz made sure not to shake German orthodoxies around balanced budgets. “I am liberal, but I am not stupid,” he once told an interviewer.
His supporters say the keen jogger is not only highly competent and a stickler for detail, but also more leftwing than his reputation.  Along with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire, he was one of the driving forces between the plan to introduced a global minimum corporate tax that was backed by the globe’s leading economies this summer.
The specific scenario that Merkel had warned about, a Scholz-led leftwing coalition between the SPD, Greens and Die Linke fell short of a majority, however, and the incumbent chancellor has declined to paint her likely heir in a negative light since then.
Asked in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung whether she could sleep soundly at night at the thought of a Social Democrat running the country, she replied: “Yes.”
Asked further whether she was concerned that in Scholz, Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi there would be three European leaders who on balance spent money rather freely, Merkel said: “With Mr Scholz I never had the impression that his purse strings are loose.”
Scholz could be officially sworn in as Merkel’s successor during the week of 6 December, as long as talks between his SPD, the Greens and the pro-business FDP continue at the current brisk pace.
Twenty-two working groups are hammering out compromises for a coalition treaty that could be presented to the public at the end of November.
In a preliminary agreement, the three parties vowed not to raise taxes or increase the amount of debt the government can take, perceived as a win for the fiscally conservative FDP, which has an eye on the finance ministry.
The preliminary coalition agreement also promises to fulfil one of the core pledges of Scholz’s election campaign, a minimum wage rise to €12 (£10.15) an hour.
The Greens will hope to have their way in the talks to move forward the end date for coal power to the year 2030, and only permit new CO2-neutral vehicles on German roads from 2035 or earlier.
While the Covid-19 pandemic had largely vanished from the political agenda during the election campaign, rising infection rates could force the parties to formulate a more concrete plan. On Friday, Germany’s disease control agency warned of a “growing likelihood of infectious contacts” after reporting 24,688 new cases and 33 more deaths. According to Johns Hopkins University’s Our World in Data monitoring, Germany has reported 527 new coronavirus-related deaths over the last seven days.
Seventy-seven percent of German adults are fully vaccinated, or 66% of the entire population. But a survey commissioned by the health ministry suggests the rate of vaccinations is unlikely to improve in the near future: 65% of those who have so far refused the jab said they would “in no way” take a vaccine in the next two months, while a further 23% said they would “probably not” let themselves be immunised.
The three parties likely to make up the next government have agreed in principle to end the “epidemic situation of national relevance” by the end of November but continue to uphold some restrictions within a new legal framework."

After nearly 16 years and 107 EU summits, Angela Merkel, the outgoing chancellor of Germany, might have expected more from her fellow leaders than a glass paperweight and praise for being a “monument”.
But at what was expected to be Merkel’s final meeting in Brussels, touching on issues ranging from energy prices to Poland’s laissez faire attitude to EU law, the former US president Barack Obama at least offered a little glamour to proceedings in a surprise appearance in a farewell video.
“Thanks to you, the centre has held through many storms,” Obama said in the video aired in the summit room in the egg-shaped Europa building in Brussels. “So many people, girls and boys, men and women, have had a role model who they could look up to through challenging times. I know because I am one of them. Danke schön.”
Despite her well-known disapproval of a fuss, Merkel was given a standing ovation at the end of the two-day meeting by her peers. She was also presented with a glass paperweight reproduction of the Europa building in which she has spent so many late nights and early mornings.
When Merkel attended her first EU summit in December 2005, her fellow leaders included Tony Blair. Earlier this week, Merkel, the EU’s problem fixer, had spoken of her deep hurt over Brexit.
At a post-summit press conference on Friday, she warned her peers that the bloc, rocked recently by the Polish government’s claim of being treated as a province in relation to negative rulings about changes to its judiciary, needed to wrestle with a fundamental question.
“There is the issue of the independence of justice, but also underlying [the question] ... which way is the European Union heading, what should be a European competence and what should be tackled by nation states?” she said. “If you look at Polish history, it is very understandable that the question of defining their national identity plays a big role … which is a different historical situation than the one countries find themselves in that have had democracy since world war two.”
The comments reflected Merkel’s role throughout her tenure as a seeker of compromise.
In an address to her and the other 26 EU heads of state and government, the European Council president, Charles Michel, offered his own idiosyncratic reflections.
“Your style is your coolness,” he said. “You are a monument.” EU summits, Michel said, “without Angela is like Rome without the Vatican or Paris without the Eiffel tower”.
The former Belgian prime minister was full of praise for her “extreme sobriety and simplicity”. He added: “This is a very powerful seduction weapon.”
“I remember our first encounter,” Michel said. “You were just very interested in hearing me explain the details of our coalition agreement and the complexity of the Belgian institutions.”
Merkel’s summit appearance was also marked by a special “family photo” of the assembled heads of state and government. It will, however, only prove to be her last if talks over the makeup of the next German government bear fruit before the next scheduled meeting on 16 December."

Angela Merkel, who earlier this week reflected on her deep hurt over Brexit, has called for European Union countries to compromise over their competing visions of integration, at what was being billed in Brussels as a farewell summit for the German chancellor.
The attempt by Merkel, at her 107th and possibly final EU summit, to smooth over a dispute over Poland’s rejection of European court of justice rulings, in an olive branch to Warsaw, came as the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, demanded tough action, and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán rallied to the defence of the Polish government.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has threatened Poland with sanctions including a block on the dispersal of €36bn (£30bn) in pandemic recovery grants and loans over its insistence that key parts of EU law are not compatible with the Polish constitution.
The claim from Warsaw, given credence in the eyes of its government by a ruling by the country’s constitutional court, follows a series of European court of justice (ECJ) rulings demanding the repeal of measures in Poland that have been said to undermine the independence of the judiciary.
In a fiery speech in the European parliament this week, the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, accused the EU institutions of overreach and turning Poland into a “province”.
The Polish position has been described by France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, as a “de facto” exit from the EU.
Merkel said she supported the commission in making its warning to Morawiecki over the need to respect the ECJ. But in a possible sign of the scars left by Brexit, the chancellor also warned of an “underlying problem” that needed resolution.
“It’s the question of how the individual members envision the EU,” Merkel said. “Is it an ever closer union or is it more nation state? And this is certainly not only an issue between Poland and the EU, but also in other member states.”
She added: “We must find ways and possibilities to come together again on this, because a cascade of legal disputes before the European court of justice is not a solution.”
While the Dutch government is far from being a champion of European federalism, Rutte has been outspoken about the need for member states to respect common EU values and laws if they are to enjoy the benefits of the union.
He said he expected Poland to lose funding if it continued to act in defiance of EU law.
“We have to be tough,” Rutte said. “The independence of the Polish judiciary is the key issue we have to discuss. It is very difficult to see how a big new fund of money could be made available to Poland when this is not settled.”
Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said: “If you want to be part of a club and have the advantages of a club, you must play by the rules. A red line has been breached and we cannot accept that.”
In an attempt to put pressure on EU leaders as they assembled, MEPs voted in favour of a resolution on Thursday calling for the commission and other 26 member states to trigger a mechanism that allows the EU to withhold funds from Poland, with 502 of 671 MEPs backing the measure.
On the other side of the argument, Orbán, whose government has also faced threats to its EU funding for failing to respect the rule of law, offered his full support to Poland.
He said: “Poland is the best country in Europe. There is no need to have any sanction, it’s ridiculous. What’s going on here is that European institutions circumvent the rights of the national parliament and government and modify the treaty without having any legitimate authority to do so. Poland is right … the real division line is common sense and non-common sense.”
Morawiecki, after a meeting with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, shortly before the summit, repeated his insistence that Poland would not be “blackmailed”, but he appeared to have softened his stance.
“We are ready for dialogue,” he said. “We will of course talk about how to resolve the current disputes in agreement and in dialogue.”
Merkel’s summit appearance, marked by a special “family photo” of the 27 heads of state and government, could prove to be her last if talks over the makeup of the next German government bear fruit before the next scheduled meeting on 16 December."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/10/sebastian-kurz-departure-further-blow-europe-centre-right;2021-10-10;Sebastian Kurz departure is further blow to Europe’s centre-right;"Resignation of Austrian chancellor follows Germany’s CDU crashing to its worst federal election result
Europe’s ailing centre-right is mourning the departure of a second high-profile conservative leader in the space of a month, as Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, announced he would resign over allegations he encouraged the use of public funds to buy himself positive media coverage.
The fall from grace of the 35-year-old leader of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) comes just weeks after its German sister party failed to fill the space left by the outgoing chancellor, Angela Merkel, and crashed to the worst result in its history at federal elections.
Supporters of the Austrian leader, long hailed as a more aggressively conservative “anti-Merkel”, hope he will continue to pull strings in his role as ÖVP president and leader of its parliamentary group after Alexander Schallenberg, a long-term Kurz ally and current foreign minister, takes over the chancellery this coming week.
“What we need now are stable conditions,” Kurz told reporters in Vienna on Saturday, while denying the substance of the corruption allegations. “So, in order to resolve the stalemate, I want to make way to prevent chaos and ensure stability.”
The swift handover of power to Schallenberg heads off a looming vote of no confidence that could potentially have had Kurz’s party ousted from power in favour of an ideology-busting government of national unity between the Austrian Social Democrats (SPÖ), Green party, the liberal Neos and the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ).
By immediately switching to the backbenches, Kurz would also gain parliamentary immunity – although the Austrian daily newspaper Der Standard reported on Sunday the outgoing chancellor would personally apply to have the special privilege lifted so he could prove his innocence.
A swift return to power – something Kurz achieved, with an increased majority, after the collapse of his coalition government with the far right over the so-called Ibiza affair in 2019 – seems unlikely, however.
The allegations that led to the Austrian chancellor’s resignation first came to light last Wednesday after Austrian anti-corruption officers searched offices at Kurz’s chancellery, the finance ministry, his party headquarters and one of the country’s most powerful media houses.
The prosecutors suspect a network of conservative politicians around Kurz used funds from the finance ministry’s public purse to buy favourable newspaper coverage, as well as to “finance partially manipulated opinion polls that served an exclusively party political interest”.
Even though the prosecutors have not named specific newspapers, the owners of the tabloid Österreich last week put out a statement denying reports it had guaranteed favourable coverage of Kurz and his party in exchange for taxpayers’ money. Over the last two years, the Österreich media group is reported to have received €1.33m (£1.13m) for advertisements placed by the finance ministry.
The tone of text messages that allegedly prove Kurz’s awareness of these backroom deals has shocked the Austrian public as much as their content, with the usually suave chancellor and his colleagues describing political rivals as “arses”.
The Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, on Friday criticised the “tone of disrespect” shown towards individuals and state institutions. The Green party, a junior coalition partner in the current government, said Kurz was no longer fit to be chancellor.
On Saturday, Kurz said the messages were written “in the heat of the battle” and had been taken out of context, saying the accusations against him “are false and I will be able to clear this up”.
The outgoing Austrian chancellor’s fall from grace has been as swift as his rise to the upper echelons of the Alpine republic’s power structures. Having been made state secretary for integration at 24, Kurz rose to the foreign ministry at 27, and became one the world’s youngest democratically elected heads of government after leading the ÖVP to an election victory in 2017.
He has refashioned the centre-right party in his image since becoming its leader in May 2017, centralising decision-making powers and changing its colours from the traditional black to turquoise.
Kurz’s approach to dealing with the rise of a xenophobic, populist outfit to his right contrasted with the strategy pursued by the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Whereas Angela Merkel’s party insisted on a “firewall” against the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Kurz co-opted the Freedom party’s hardline immigration stances and entered a power-sharing agreement with it in his first term.
As the CDU is licking its wounds after 26 September’s painful defeat at federal elections, several voices of the German centre-right have pointed to Kurz as a model for renewing the party. “We need a German Sebastian Kurz,” the head of the CDU’s youth movement demanded only at the start of the month. After the events of the last week, such calls are going to be heard more rarely."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/06/german-greens-want-coalition-talks-spd-fdp;2021-10-06;Scholz moves step closer to succeeding Merkel as German chancellor;"Greens and liberals say they are willing to enter formal coalition talks with Scholz’s Social Democratic party
Olaf Scholz has come a step closer to succeeding Angela Merkel as German chancellor after the Greens and liberals announced their readiness to enter formal coalition talks with his Social Democratic party (SPD).
Scholz, who is also the serving finance minister, welcomed the agreement, triggered by an invitation from the Greens to the Free Democrats (FDP) for the three parties to start talks on Thursday. It makes the prospect of a centre-left government replacing the centre-right-led one which has been in power for 16 years more likely than at any time since the 26 September election.
Scholz said the talks would focus on forming a government which would “bring about progress and the necessary modernisation in Germany” and added he was “grateful for the very professional and serious manner in which the Greens and the FDP have expedited the formation of a government”.
The Greens’ co-leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, called an impromptu press conference earlier on Wednesday morning at which they declared their willingness to enter serious negotiations, 10 days after the national election.
Christian Lindner of the FDP followed about an hour later with a declaration before journalists that he had accepted the Greens’ invitation. He said his party would not be holding parallel talks with the Christian Democrats (CDU) whose leader, Armin Laschet, has not given up his hopes of succeeding Merkel.
No party won an overall majority in the 26 September election, but the SPD narrowly beat the outgoing chancellor’s conservatives for first place.
Habeck said the Greens “do not want to play an artificial poker game” and that owing to the “large amount of content overlap” between the parties, they were therefore “proposing to the FDP to approach the SPD together and from there to move from an exploratory negotiation phase to one of three-way talks”.
He admitted there were many areas in which the parties had to find agreement. “Many things have yet to be discussed,” he said.
Baerbock said that with a three-way coalition, the first on the federal level, Germany would be “learning a new form of politics”.
Lindner, appearing slightly caught off-guard, signalled that the impetus for reform was what gave his party and the Greens the biggest motivation for making a coalition work.
“We have accepted the suggestion to talk to the SPD,” he said. “Due to the common understanding that this country needs reform, this common interest [between the FDP and Greens] has emerged, despite the differences between us.” He said he was hopeful the sense of urgency could lead to a “progress-friendly focal point … which will trigger the powers of imagination”.
Laschet has refused to bow to pressure from within his own party to relinquish the idea of being able to form a government under his leadership. “We have signalled that we are ready to hold further talks,” he said. “But the decision as to which order one chooses to speak to whom, lies with the FDP and Greens.”
But Markus Söder, head of the CDU’s sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, appeared more willing to concede defeat.
“A clear direction has been decided on,” he said. “The CSU respects this decision. The new government is not yet decided on for sure, but the Union will not stand around on the back burner.”
In the past week the four main parties have pursued a flurry of two-way confidential talks, prompting a large degree of speculation and rumour, fuelled in part by leaks from within the CDU of behind-the-scenes discussions, which drew widespread condemnation from across the parties.
On Tuesday the possibility of a coalition between the CDU, Greens and FDP, considered far less likely based on the election results, was given a degree of momentum after the Greens and CDU leadership concluded a two-hour discussion by saying talks had been constructive and would continue.
But by clearly signalling their direction of travel on Wednesday, the Greens have given the talks a focus they had lacked until now.
The Social Democrats secured 25.7% of the vote, the CDU 24.1%, the Greens 14.8% and the FDP 11.5% in last month’s election, making the Greens and FDP kingmakers in any potential coalition.
In polls before and since, Germans have consistently said their preference is for a so-called “traffic light” coalition between the SPD, Greens and FDP, whose trademark colours are red, green and yellow respectively.
A “Jamaica coalition” of the CDU, Greens and FDP – their party colours coinciding with those of the Jamaican flag – is, while a mathematical possibility, far less popular.
However, FDP leaders said a Jamaica coalition should not be ruled out in the case that traffic light talks stalled.
A repeat of the grand coalition between the CDU and SPD, which has governed Germany for 12 of the past 16 years under the chancellor, Angela Merkel, is seen as an administration of last resort that has very little public backing.
However, there remains a high degree of wariness at this stage as to whether talks will lead to a successful conclusion, owing to the months of heated wrangling between the CDU, Greens and FDP after the last election in 2017, which ended in stalemate. It took about six months after the election for the grand coalition government to be formed.
This time around all the main parties have been at pains to stress the need for urgency. Huge challenges face Europe’s largest economy, not least how to drive a post-pandemic recovery at the same time as catching up with digitalisation and taking a global lead in pursuing innovative, sustainable and economically viable policies to tackle the climate emergency.
The first round of talks between the three viable coalition partners, the so-called Ampelsondierungen – literally “traffic light probings” – are expected to begin on Thursday.
Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, will continue in a caretaker role as German leader until a new government is in place."

Germany’s Green party and conservatives have described initial rounds of exploratory coalition talks as “constructive”.
The comment came after the first formal meeting since last month’s election between the likely chief kingmaker in a future government and the second-placed Christian Democrats (CDU).
Despite pressure on the CDU’s Armin Laschet to relinquish his claim to a place in government after the party returned its historically worst ever result, he is forging ahead in his attempts to woo both the Greens and the pro-business FDP to form a CDU-led Jamaica coalition, so-called due to yellow, black and green colours of the three parties matching those of Jamaica’s flag.
Annalena Baerbock, main candidate for the Greens, which secured just under 15% of votes, said the two-hour long discussion on Tuesday had been “constructive and objective” but that no decision would be reached in the coming days.
The Greens have long favoured a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), which narrowly won the largest share of votes in the 26 September vote.
But the FDP, which secured just 11.5% and is viewed as the other kingmaker, would prefer a partnership with the CDU. Most obvious coalition options will have to involve a third party.
Laschet said on Tuesday that his conservative alliance, which won just over 24%, “is basically prepared for such a union” and described the meeting as a “good exchange”.
The SPD, led by its chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz, held bilateral talks with the Greens and FDP on Sunday and said it was ready for three-way talks.
The outcome most popular with the German electorate, according to a series of polls, is a “traffic light” coalition led by the SPD with the Greens and the FDP, with red, green and yellow party colours.
In a new survey on Tuesday for the broadcasters RTL/ntv-Trendbarometer, 74% of those questioned were in favour of the CDU going into opposition, after 16 years in government under chancellor Angela Merkel.
While 48% of CDU/CSU voters said the conservatives should try to form a Jamaica coalition, an almost equal amount, 47%, said they should go into opposition; 53% of all of those questioned were in favour of a traffic light coalition, and only 22% wanted Jamaica.
A repeat of the grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD, which has been in power for 12 of the past 16 years, is seen as an administration of last resort, if talks between the other groupings fail, and has the backing of only 12% of the electorate, according to the poll.
All parties have stressed the need for a swifter conclusion to the talks than after the last election in 2017 when they dragged on for nearly six months.
Pressure is mounting due to the challenges which lie ahead for Germany, including post-pandemic economic recovery and widespread structural reform in an effort to tackle climate change.
But observers insist the complexity of a three-way coalition means the prospect of a new government before Christmas would be optimistic.
The FDP and the SPD in particular, have accused the CDU of not playing by the rules by leaking details of their respective bilateral talks to the German media.
Merkel will remain in power in a caretaker role until a new government is in place.

Merkel’s crown as Europe’s leader up for grabs;"The three contenders to take the helm for the continent as era of outgoing German chancellor draws to a close
She dominated Europe – a de facto leader in a time of crisis. For 16 years, Angela Merkel has used her signature cautious, calm pragmatism to steer the continent through the rise of the far-right, a blundered response to migrant arrivals, and, of course, Brexit.
With the Merkel era drawing to a close, another European leader could emerge and take the helm. Here are the main contenders:
One of the most insightful endorsements of Mario Draghi’s leadership came from the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, during a visit to Rome in June.
Describing the former European Central Bank chief as a “maestro”, Sanchez said: “Whenever Draghi speaks to the European Council, we all fall silent and listen. This isn’t something that happens often.”
Draghi, appointed Italian prime minister in February, has had a similar impact on the bunch of fractious political parties that make up his broad coalition, each of them falling into line over a range of thorny issues including the introduction of a Covid-19 vaccine passport.
He has also impressed the electorate, polling as Italy’s most appreciated leader. It’s a far cry from what the population is used to.
Draghi’s government has salvaged the country’s vaccination programme, revived the economy and adopted workable measures to contain coronavirus infections. On top of that, Draghi managed to push through a contested reform of the justice system, a requirement for Italy to secure the lion’s share of the European Union’s pandemic recovery fund.
“Things need to be done because they need to be done, not to have an immediate result, even if they are unpopular,” Draghi said earlier in September.
Pragmatic, calm, decisive and not afraid to say it how it is, for some of those close to him, Draghi, respected abroad as much as he is at home, is the most viable person to fill Merkel’s shoes as Europe’s de facto leader.
“We have the most prominent figure, it’s Draghi,” said Giancarlo Giorgetti, Italy’s minister of economic development.
European politics played almost no role in the German election campaign. Which probably has a lot to do with the fact that despite the differences in policies between the parties now jockeying for a position in the post-Merkel government, on Europe every mainstream party is more or less on the same page: Germany needs the EU almost more than the EU needs Germany. It’s raison d’etre is to ensure it does not fail.
If Scholz successfully assembles a coalition government and become chancellor, not that much is likely to change.
His role as finance minister under Merkel – responsible for keeping the economy going – and his central contribution towards setting up the EU’s €750bn (£642bn) coronavirus recovery fund, reinforced his commitment to the bloc as well as his gravitas as a strategic, albeit not exciting, decision-maker.
He called the fund “a clear signal for European solidarity and strength”, at the same time as he sent the message to a domestic audience that a powerful recovery in Europe was a crucial prerequisite for securing Germany’s own economic prosperity.
Scholz would be under pressure to take a leadership role over issues such as creating a refugee policy based on solidarity – something Merkel did not manage to achieve – as well as the challenge of driving environmental reform and coupling it with economic growth. He is a pragmatist rather than a visionary, but that is more likely to reassure than put off his future counterparts.
Macron has been outlining his vision for Europe since his election, arguing repeatedly since his major Sorbonne speech in 2017 that the EU has to address its failings: in his words, “too weak, too slow, too inefficient”.
His proposals, – an integrated EU defence, eurozone reform, a common asylum policy, a digital tax – have made little progress, hampered partly by a paralysed German coalition and the cautious, consensual instincts of Merkel.
Few observers believe, however, that the chancellor’s departure will clear the way for France’s ambitious, impatient and at times arrogant president to step straight into her shoes: no single leader, most say, will match Merkel’s influence at its peak.
In the wake of this month’s crisis with the US, Australia and the UK over the Aukus security deal, which cost France a multibillion-euro submarine contract, he once more urged greater European autonomy as China rises and the US refocuses on Asia.
After the chaotic western withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Aukus debacle, more EU leaders may now be willing to agree that the EU must be less dependent on Washington – but few want to risk harming transatlantic relations, and an EU army is a long way off.
How far Macron succeeds in advancing his agenda will depend largely on the success of France’s six-month presidency of the EU, which starts in January, and, of course, on him securing re-election himself in next April’s French presidential election.
He will certainly try to assume Merkel’s mantle. But he will need partners to get anywhere, along with compromise and consensus: the hallmarks of Merkel, but not, so far, Macron.

Less than four years ago, Erik von Malottki’s main objective was to keep the party he loved as far away from political power as possible. Inspired by young activist grassroots movements in the US and the UK, the trade unionist was one of a band of young Social Democratic Party (SPD) members who in January 2018 urged delegates to vote against joining another coalition with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.
Yet this week, the now 35-year-old and a band of similarly aged delegates propelled the German centre-left to an unlikely election victory. While the British Labour party remains entrenched in factionalism, the SPD has constructively channelled the energy of its youthful rebels, edging ahead in Sunday’s vote through a seismic shift in the country’s north-east.
The victory was narrow, with the SPD pulling ahead of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of the outgoing chancellor Merkel by only 1.6 percentage points. Whether its leader, Olaf Scholz, will also become Germany’s next chancellor depends on complicated coalition talks over the coming weeks.
But in the two northernmost states of the formerly socialist east, the SPD’s triumph was comprehensive: in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the party won a direct mandate in every single one of the 16 constituencies, all bar one of which were previously held by the CDU.
Its most symbolic victory came in the electoral district of Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I, where Anna Kassautzki, who was born in 1993, won a direct mandate held since 1990 by none other than Merkel.
At simultaneous state elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the Social Democrats emerged victorious with nearly 40% of the vote, a nine-percentage-point swing on 2016.
A deeper look into the electoral history of the region shows how remarkable the turnaround was. While Mecklenburg, the state’s western region, has a history of tilting left, Vorpommern on the Baltic Sea used to be a conservative stronghold – partly a result of the CDU being able to inherit party structures built by its socialist East German counterpart after the fall of the Berlin Wall (the SPD, by contrast, was banned under the socialist regime).
In Erik von Malottki’s constituency, Mecklenburgische Seenplatte I – Vorpommern-Greifswald II, the fight for first place used to be between the CDU and the far-left Die Linke. This year, the expectation was for a tight race between the CDU and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
“No one expected us to win here when we picked our candidates a year ago,” said Patrick Dahlemann, a 33-year-old delegate in the regional state parliament and one of the architects of the SPD’s regional revival. “To be honest, it wasn’t something we would have even dared dream of three weeks ago.” Yet in the early hours of Monday morning, Von Malottki swooped into the top spot from fourth place, 796 votes ahead of the AfD candidate.
Much of the SPD’s popularity here is due to the party’s national campaign. The centre left’s promise to raise the minimum wage to €12 an hour (£10.25) has been dismissed as tokenism by its opponents, but in the structurally weaker regions of the north-east and the Ruhr valley, it made voters listen: 60% of workers in Von Malottki’s constituency are on low wages. “For people here, the new minimum wage would be an absolute gamechanger,” he said.
Delivered by the monosyllabic northerner Olaf Scholz, a more familiar figure in the Baltic flatlands than the jovial Rhinelander Armin Laschet, the promise had credibility. Had the anti-coalition campaigners succeeded in pushing the SPD into opposition in 2018, it probably would have had less. “Scholz would never have ever been such a carthorse for us if he hadn’t been finance minister for the last four years,” said Dahlemann.
Yet neither would Scholz’s promises have been championed with the same energy at a local level if it hadn’t been for the Social Democrats’ youthful rebels. After failing to stop their party from joining another “grand coalition”, they claimed a totemic victory in November 2019, when Scholz lost out on the party leadership to the leftwingers Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans.
What seemed at the time like an upset created an equilibrium that made it possible for young members such as Von Malottki to throw their weight behind Scholz’s candidacy: “We knew they would have a seat at the table when it comes to coalition talks.” On the ground, the younger candidates lent a touch of populist aggression to Scholz’s statesman-like appeal.
Infrastructure problems in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are plain for everyone to see: trains cut through the region intermittently, and ticket halls at smaller rail stops have been derelict for decades. , Despite local campaigns, the Karnin lift bridge across the Peenestrom estuary has lain moribund since it was destroyed by the Nazis in an attempt to halt the Red Army’s advance in 1945.
The SPD’s young candidates wasted no time pinning the blame on the federal transport ministry, run by the Bavarian CSU since 2009. “In Bavaria, they build motorways without end,” Von Malottki said. His party has pledged to set up a demand-responsive bus network in regions cut off from public transport lines.
Embroiled in numerous corruption scandals during the pandemic, Merkel’s conservatives have done their bit to impersonate a party drunk on political power: the prodigal rise of the 28-year-old local CDU candidate Philipp Amthor was halted last year over his lobbying on behalf of an American IT company.
The SPD identified a chink in the Christian Democrats’ armour. Von Malottki signed a pledge to donate any extra income to charity. On his Twitter and Instagram channels, he started using the hashtag #unbribable. Precisely because his odds of winning looked so low, he said, voters believed him.
“None of us decided to stand as a candidate because we had our eyes on a career,” said Von Malottki, whose father is a forester and whose mother works at post-reunification agency tasked with opening up Stasi files to the public. “We’re all idealists. I was expecting to lose, so I wanted to at least run a campaign that people would remember me by.”
The SPD may have painted the north-east red, but its victory remains fragile. In several constituencies, the AfD came in at a close-run second place – in some, it increased its share of the vote.
The centre-left won the fight by taking on the AfD over material questions such as wages but it has barely taken the fight to the far right on cultural questions, such as over immigration or gender politics. Should it fail to act out its ideals in government, the north-east could eventually be awash in the bright blue colours of the populist right.
“We’ve only just recovered from the Schröder years,” Von Malottki said. “If we don’t deliver on our promises, all our gains will be gone again in four years.”"

Germany’s general election signals far more than just the end of the Angela Merkel era. Although it will eventually produce yet another centrist coalition government, this should not be dismissed as simply the same old same-old. For the new government will represent several steps into the unknown. There will be significant lessons and lasting political consequences – for Germany above all, but also for the continent of which, in spite of everything, Britain remains part.
Even without Merkel at the helm, Germany remains Europe’s economic powerhouse and principal regional player. That will not change. Yet, with no party exceeding 26% of the votes after last Sunday’s contest, German voters have ushered in a new and more fragmented political order. For the first time they face government by a three-party coalition, not the more familiar two.
The new government is likely to be led eventually by the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz. But the parties on which he would rely – the Greens and the economically liberal Free Democrats – will drive hard bargains. In the short term this may signal weeks of paralysis in Berlin – just as Germany takes over as chair of the G7. On the larger stage, it raises doubts about Germany’s familiar role under Merkel as the European Union’s ultimate anchor and arbiter. France may spy a window of opportunity to assert itself as Europe’s leader.
Some will seize on the revival of the Social Democrats (SPD) as the single most striking aspect of the election. After all, Scholz has turned around the seemingly inexorable electoral decline of Germany’s – and Europe’s – main party of the centre left. The SPD had slid from 41% support in 1998 to 21% in 2017. This week’s 26% vote showed noteworthy improvements in every part of the former East Germany.
Does this mean that those reports of the death of social democratic politics have been confounded? Up to a point, yes. If Scholz becomes chancellor, he will join centre-left heads of governments in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Spain, Portugal, arguably France, and potentially soon Norway. His own record – both as SPD leader and, before that, as a generally successful mayor of Hamburg – suggests Scholz should not be glibly dismissed as continuity Merkel.
Yet gaining barely more than a quarter of the vote should be no one’s idea of triumph. It is the direct result of the continuing diffusion of electoral support, and of the less firmly embedded nature of political identity that characterise many post-industrial democracies, especially under proportional voting systems. Yet Britain’s first-past-the-post system does not disguise the fact that a similar lightness of political identity is established here too. This is a problem with which Labour’s Keir Starmer has also been grappling this week.
In many ways, the most extraordinary aspect of the German election result was the eclipse of the CDU-CSU Christian Democrats. Merkel’s party recorded an all-time low vote share of 24%. It lost support in every part of Germany. The CDU and its Bavarian CSU ally have clearly been stunned.
Merkel’s own seat on the Baltic was won by the SPD. Across in Saarland, so was that of her original choice of successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. The economy minister, Peter Altmaier, went down too. So did Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun. The CDU candidate to succeed Merkel, Armin Laschet, is being urged to resign his leadership of North-Rhine Westphalia.
Given the CDU-CSU’s dominance of postwar German politics, reinforced after reunification under Helmut Kohl in 1990, this rejection is genuinely remarkable. Yet it echoes that of other seemingly impregnable centre-right parties elsewhere in Europe, such as the French Gaullists and the Italian Christian Democrats.
Nevertheless, the dynamics of the CDU-CSU collapse must not be misunderstood. It has become common to claim that the decline of centre parties of left and right is the result of shared policy failures that have triggered the rise of the nativist far right. But this absolutely did not happen in Germany.
Far from rising as the CDU-CSU fell back, the vote of the rightwing AfD went down by 2.3%. The leftwing party Die Linke did worse, losing almost half its votes and seats to become even more marginal. Instead, disillusioned centre-right voters migrated to the centre, to the SPD, Greens and FDP, not to the extremes.
The conclusion seems to be that German voters are searching for better and more progressive centrist solutions than Merkel’s successors offered. This is neither irrational nor perverse, and Germany is far from alone.
Europe is full of countries with latent or actual majorities for a less hegemonic progressivism than the mass parties of the industrial past tried to uphold. Britain, as Gordon Brown argued persuasively this month, is very much one of them. If Scholz proves to be the skilled political sculptor who can bring life and shape to the majority emerging from inside his country’s block of electoral marble, he will find he has many eager imitators.

It was billed as Angela Merkel’s grand farewell. But while a narrow election win for the centre-left SPD looks set to lead – eventually – to Olaf Scholz becoming Germany’s new chancellor, protracted coalition negotiations mean Merkel will be around for a few weeks yet. In our big story, Jan Werner-Müller reflects on the highs and lows of Merkelism, while Philip Oltermann explains Germany’s coalition possibilities after a tense election.
Two blockbuster interviews occupy our feature pages this week. First, Simon Hattenstone meets the inspirational Greta Thunberg, who outlines her powerful vision on how to tackle the climate crisis and opens up about the reality of being the world’s most famous activist.
Then Lisa Allardice catches up with the great American novelist Jonathan Franzen, who seems as ready as ever to speak his mind. And if that’s enough heavyweight reading for you, we ponder the global phenomenon that is The Great British Bake Off, which has just begun its 12th series and has local versions showing in 35 countries.
From this week you’ll notice some new features in our Books, Lifestyle and Diversions pages, in line with broader changes across the Guardian’s other print products.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-german-election-results-negotiating-a-new-era#comments;2021-09-27;The Guardian view on the German election results: negotiating a new era;"An SPD-led coalition would be in the country’s best interests, but after a knife-edge result, there is no guarantee one will emerge
Less than two years ago, the German Social Democratic party stood at 11% in the polls and appeared to be a moribund political force. Sunday’s knife-edge federal election, in which the SPD narrowly topped the polls with 26% of the vote, represents therefore one of the more improbable political comebacks of recent times. It is also a personal vindication for Olaf Scholz, the party’s candidate for chancellor. As the SPD bumped along in a poor third place, behind the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Greens, Mr Scholz’s conviction that he could still win the top job was treated as fantasy politics from the representative of a party on the road to nowhere. But as his rivals became increasingly accident-prone during a rollercoaster campaign, Mr Scholz’s suggestion that he represented the safest pair of hands to take Germany beyond the Merkel era became ever more plausible.
Whether he will get the chance to do so is still up in the air, and is likely to remain so for some time. The election has delivered a fragmentary political landscape with a near-perfect balance of forces between left and right. Chastened after the worst performance in its history, the CDU nevertheless finished only two percentage points behind the SPD. And while the Greens scored their best-ever result in finishing third, their influence in forthcoming coalition negotiations is almost matched by the economically liberal FDP, which opposes tax rises and is committed to restoring debt restrictions loosened during the pandemic. Preliminary negotiations between these two “kingmakers” will help determine whether the future coalition tilts left or right. Right now, the only certainty is that, for the first time since the 1950s, Germany will be governed by a three-party coalition.
That reflects what may be a lasting end to the CDU/SPD duopoly which dominated postwar German politics. In other European countries such as France, Spain, Italy and the Scandinavian nations, the emergence of new parties has complicated the life of the traditional centre-left and centre-right. Under Ms Merkel’s skilful leadership, the CDU appeared to have defied the zeitgeist to some extent, unlike the SPD. But the drop in poll ratings under the lacklustre leadership of Armin Laschet will not be easy to reverse. On the far right, the Alternative für Deutschland party failed to make significant gains but did well in the east, partly at the expense of the hard-left Die Linke, and has become a normalised part of the electoral landscape. The marked preference of younger voters for the Greens and the FDP, rather than the two traditional powerhouses, also suggests an increasingly plural political future.

Less than two years ago, the German Social Democratic party stood at 11% in the polls and appeared to be a moribund political force. Sunday’s knife-edge federal election, in which the SPD narrowly topped the polls with 26% of the vote, represents therefore one of the more improbable political comebacks of recent times. It is also a personal vindication for Olaf Scholz, the party’s candidate for chancellor. As the SPD bumped along in a poor third place, behind the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Greens, Mr Scholz’s conviction that he could still win the top job was treated as fantasy politics from the representative of a party on the road to nowhere. But as his rivals became increasingly accident-prone during a rollercoaster campaign, Mr Scholz’s suggestion that he represented the safest pair of hands to take Germany beyond the Merkel era became ever more plausible.
Whether he will get the chance to do so is still up in the air, and is likely to remain so for some time. The election has delivered a fragmentary political landscape with a near-perfect balance of forces between left and right. Chastened after the worst performance in its history, the CDU nevertheless finished only two percentage points behind the SPD. And while the Greens scored their best-ever result in finishing third, their influence in forthcoming coalition negotiations is almost matched by the economically liberal FDP, which opposes tax rises and is committed to restoring debt restrictions loosened during the pandemic. Preliminary negotiations between these two “kingmakers” will help determine whether the future coalition tilts left or right. Right now, the only certainty is that, for the first time since the 1950s, Germany will be governed by a three-party coalition.
That reflects what may be a lasting end to the CDU/SPD duopoly which dominated postwar German politics. In other European countries such as France, Spain, Italy and the Scandinavian nations, the emergence of new parties has complicated the life of the traditional centre-left and centre-right. Under Ms Merkel’s skilful leadership, the CDU appeared to have defied the zeitgeist to some extent, unlike the SPD. But the drop in poll ratings under the lacklustre leadership of Armin Laschet will not be easy to reverse. On the far right, the Alternative für Deutschland party failed to make significant gains but did well in the east, partly at the expense of the hard-left Die Linke, and has become a normalised part of the electoral landscape. The marked preference of younger voters for the Greens and the FDP, rather than the two traditional powerhouses, also suggests an increasingly plural political future.

The German constituency held by Angela Merkel for the last 30 years has flipped to a 27-year-old politician from the Social Democratic party (SPD), in the starkest expression yet of a generational change of guard underlying Sunday’s national vote.
Germany’s outgoing chancellor had continuously won a direct mandate in the electoral district of Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I since it was created after reunification in 1990.
Her successor, however, will not hail from her party but its historical rival: Anna Kassautzki of the SPD claimed the seat on the Baltic coast with 24.3% of first votes, improving her party’s performance by 12.7 percentage points.
Merkel’s designated successor in the district, the 33-year-old tax auditor Georg Günther, came second on 20.4% of first votes.
“I feel incredibly honoured,” said Kassautzki. “We delivered a team effort.”
Born in Heidelberg in 1993, the politician is a district leader of the Young Socialists movement and works at the University of Greifswald, where she leads a family support service team.
Kassautzki has said she is animated by social injustice and describes herself as a committed feminist and European in her Twitter biography. “If we want to move our country forward, we must ask the upper 10% to pay up more instead of courting them,” she wrote on her campaign website.
The 27-year-old’s triumph is representative of a broader change of power in Germany’s north-east, where the SPD managed to flip every single constituency in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, as well as emerging triumphant in parallel state elections in the latter and in Berlin.
The Green party, which used to have only one direct mandate, managed to expand its number of directly elected candidates to 16, after flipping unlikely seats in conservative strongholds such as south-western Baden-Württemberg and Munich.
The Bundestag will have its first two transgender delegates in the coming term after an increase in the ecological party’s share under the second vote. The Green candidates Tessa Ganserer and Nyke Slawik will enter parliament via their party’s list.
Slawik tweeted that she could hardly believe her win, adding she hoped “we will today open a new chapter of self-determination in politics and that we can end the years-long patronising of queer people”."
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/27/europe-angela-merkel-chancellor-germany-eu;2021-09-27;Europe is losing its moral compass – how will it find its way without Merkel?;"The pragmatic chancellor’s departure will be a turning point not only for Germany but also the EU
During a farewell tour of European heads of state and government this summer, Angela Merkel went to see the Queen. The few filmed minutes of her arrival in Windsor are irresistible. On one side, the Queen in a green floral dress, her smile controlled by centuries of code and tradition. On the other, a shy-seeming woman in trousers and purple jacket, nodding her head too many times, trying to observe the correct rituals for greeting a monarch. Elizabeth and Angela: two opposite worlds, two entirely different functions, and yet, similarities. Those boring speeches no one dares to make any more. That style, that calm, that stability and that way of embodying their countries.
Merkel now embodies more than Germany; she embodies Europe. She’s a pop icon, who has entered our consciousness like a song. Mugs, T-shirts and even lemon squeezers are sold in her image. But her rise and longevity remain a mystery. How could this woman, so strangely indifferent to the trappings of power, take over a party held for half a century by conservative males, and then be elected four times in a row to lead one of the world’s great powers? How did she become such a role model that a schoolboy once asked her in all innocence: “Can a boy also become chancellor?”
For years, I’ve been watching, writing on and, most recently, making a film about Merkel. It hasn’t been a blind admiration but rather a fascination: because Germany’s first female chancellor, who led Europe’s most powerful economy for 16 years, emerged from a country that no longer exists. We hardly remember its name, or reduce it to three initials: GDR. What other world leader can claim such an extraordinary backstory?
Merkel retires from the German chancellorship having spent more than half her life in a Soviet bloc dictatorship, a country separated from its western half and excluded from the free world. How could she not be radically different? She has already had two lives: before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The most common criticism of Merkel is that she has “done nothing”. That she leaves no mark on history, unlike her predecessors. Konrad Adenauer integrated West Germany into the international community and helped lay the foundations of today’s EU. Helmut Kohl brought about the reunification of Germany and subsumed the deutschmark into the single European currency. Gerhard Schröder undertook brutal and unpopular labour law reforms to make Germany competitive. So what has Merkel done for posterity? She has no major reforms to her credit. But her political record, alongside her two lives, has two sides: it can be read in both directions.
She entered politics on a whim just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. An ordinary chemist, devoid of oratorical skills, charisma, political guile or even any particular agenda. And at 35, she found herself, by a quirk of history, in the right place at the right time. She knew what to make of it.
Merkel came to power when September 11 still cast a long shadow over the west. An uninterrupted series of European and global crises followed. Ambitious reform is certainly not in her DNA, and luckily it was not the priority the times demanded of her. Merkel showed she was more of a manager than a visionary.
Yet, as well as managing every crisis that came her way, she restored German prosperity, aided by the Schröder reforms that she had the foresight to support when she was still leader of the opposition. On Merkel’s watch, Germany also softened its image: from austere and unattractive to likable. For 16 years, Merkel has made Germany happy. The first secret of her longevity in power is that she was entirely in tune with her country and her times. She was in the right place at the right time.
The second criticism is that she was more German than European. In short: a selfish, inward-looking leader. The criticism comes in particular from France – a country that professes to prefer romantic ideas of “fraternity” and “solidarity” to the dull realism of German budgetary discipline – and Berlin’s habit of insisting on respecting the letter of the treaties that unite us.
But was it selfish to save Europe’s honour by reaching out to more than a million refugees, whom other leaders, notably French, pretended not to see? Although leader of the EU’s richest country, and so its biggest budget contributor, Merkel lacked the audacity required to drive the European Union forward. She has driven more than one French president crazy and exhausted four of them (Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande, Macron), by not responding decisively to the 2008 financial crisis, instead imposing a slowness that almost strangled the Greek population and cost Europe dearly. She overplayed German economic nationalism and engaged in diplomatic mercantilism with Russia and China. For a long time, she opposed Emmanuel Macron’s ambitions for a Europe-wide mutualisation of debt, a German taboo.
But who finally got Germany to agree to back a massive post-Covid recovery plan for Europe? Merkel was the one who led Germany, in the end, to its own European revolution. In an interview with Macron for my book on Merkel, I asked the president whether (as one German official had told me) his desire to be remembered for ambitious European projects had at times rankled the more pragmatic chancellor.
Macron admitted that he and Merkel came from “different mental universes” but that, while she took longer to think about proposals and faced immense constraints, in the end she came around to supporting the same ambitions. “I think the things we achieved together in Europe were exactly what she wanted.”
Macron, despite awkward beginnings, became her favourite French president because they are both, in their own way, political UFOs, neither from the left nor the right. Merkelism, like Macronism, consists of a skilful acrobatics of reconciling opposites.
Merkel’s faults, failings, mistakes and inflexibilities cost Europe dearly at times. Her departure is a turning point; it leaves Germany facing immense challenges, not least the climate crisis, and the chance to open a new page in its history.
So why will I will miss her? Because her flaws and her qualities have, to my mind, both been guided by her moral compass. Morality made her put an end to the career of Kohl, her former CDU mentor, in 1999 after he had let the party become tainted by scandal. Morality about decades of corruption and tax evasion in Greece made her excessively rigid during the euro crisis. And morality made her utter the three words “Wir schaffen das” (we’ll make it) to ask her country to take in a million refugees.
Her life experience in the “country that no longer exists” made her measure the price of the values she was deprived of: freedom (including for refugees), concern for unity and unconditional respect for her opponents, whether in the German parliament, in eastern Europe or on the other side of the Channel.
Her low-key style and flat speeches are the antithesis of the populist politics reinvented by Donald Trump and the architects of Brexit. Merkel often changed her mind, but never made a false promise, because she never promised anything. For her, the function of words is to describe reality. Despite her diplomatic acrobatics, her reliance on tactics and even her mediocrity, Merkel is the anti-Trump, the anti-Johnson, the anti-populist. Her morality as a leader is what I will miss.
Under Merkel, the CDU has dominated German politics for the past 16 years. As her era ends, the party stands defeated. But whatever shape the incoming coalition takes, German democracy will remain rock solid, and Germany will stay anchored in Europe. For Europe, and a turbulent, anxious world, however, Merkel’s departure is the loss of a reassuring beacon.

Germany is set for weeks or even months of protracted coalition talks after the race to succeed Angela Merkel after 16 years in power failed to produce a clear winner, with the centre-left Social Democrats just ahead of the centre-right conservative alliance according to official returns.
Preliminary results released on the election commission’s website showed that the Social Democrats (SPD) led by Olaf Scholz had won the largest share of the vote at 25.7%.
The centre-right CDU-CSU bloc led for so long by the outgoing chancellor garnered 24.1%, its worst showing in its seven-decade history.
The Green party, in jubilant mood after winning 14.8% in its best result in a national poll, despite having lost the lead it held early on and dropping about 13 points since April, was confident of becoming a kingmaker in the upcoming coalition talks.
Both its candidate, Annalena Baerbock, at 40 the youngest chancellor candidate by some way, and the SPD’s Scholz expressed their willingness to work together, with Scholz quickly moving to congratulate the environmentalists and saying there were plenty of areas in which the parties overlapped.
But he said in the so-called “elephant round”, a television debate involving all the lead candidates two hours after polling booths closed, “out of respect for the citizens of this country, we cannot make any final decisions”. Scholz said his wish was for “constructive discussions, so that the whole country can recognise itself in the future government”.
Olaf Scholz
The finance minister and deputy chancellor in Merkel’s last government, has been an influential player in German politics since 2002, when he became the centre-left Social Democratic Party’s general secretary under Gerhard Schröder.
A former labour lawyer and deputy leader of the SPD’s then anti-capitalist Young Socialist youth wing, the taciturn 63-year-old has for most of his career been associated with the party’s right: as senator for the interior and then mayor of Hamburg, he often pursued strict law and order policies and continued the mercantilist traditions of the rich port city in Germany’s north.
In the federal finance ministry, Scholz made sure not to shake German orthodoxies around balanced budgets. “I am liberal, but I am not stupid,” he once told an interviewer.
His supporters say the keen jogger is not only highly competent and a stickler for detail, but also more leftwing than his reputation.  Along with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire, he was one of the driving forces between the plan to introduced a global minimum corporate tax that was backed by the globe’s leading economies this summer.
The initial reaction of the SPD had been of cautious optimism as well as relief that Scholz, the incumbent finance minister, appeared to have retained gains made in the latter part of the campaign. Analysis of the result late on Sunday night by the pollster Infratest Dimap showed that the SPD had managed to secure the support of 1.36 million CDU/CSU voters. At the headquarters of the Christian Democrats (CDU), any relief that it had not slipped as low as polls suggested it might under Armin Laschet was overshadowed by the fact that it appeared to be heading for its worst result in a federal election. According to analysis it lost also around 900,000 voters to the Green party and 340,000 to the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), with the latter picking up between 11-12% of the national vote.
The Green party was also buoyed by having almost doubled its result compared with 2017, making more gains than any other party and beating the FDP into third place. It also convinced 250,000 previous non-voters to give it their votes. The results strongly indicate that the environmentalists are on track to enter a new government.
Likely constellations include a so-called green-yellow-red “traffic light” coalition, with the SPD, Greens and FDP, or a “Jamaican” coalition of the CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP.
The far-right Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) is poised to enter the Bundestag for the second time, having won 10.3% of the vote, but to lose its position as main opposition party, while the leftwing Die Linke appeared to be on the cusp of failing to reach the 5% hurdle required to earn a place in parliament.
The preliminary results indicate that Germany is heading, as was widely predicted, for a three-way coalition. If past experience is anything to go by – in 2017 it took around three months – this will involve an extended period of heated wrangling. Merkel would remain as a caretaker leader in the meantime.
The election marked the first time since the second world war that an incumbent chancellor did not run for re-election. It left the contest far more volatile and unpredictable than ever, and left many Germans – according to polls, between 25% and 40% – undecided up until the day of the vote.
Laschet, addressing disappointed CDU followers at the party’s Berlin headquarters in the presence of Merkel, said the party had suffered from not having the so-called “chancellor bonus” after the latter’s departure. “It was clear to us that without having the bonus of being home to the person in office, it would be an open, hard and close election campaign,” he said.
“We are not happy with the result,” he added, but earned cheers for saying he would nevertheless put his “every effort into ensuring the new government is CDU-led”. Merkel looked on and waved, her face largely covered by a black mask.
The SPD minister Hubertus Heil told a German broadcaster: “The night is young. But it’s a huge success for us. A year ago we were 20% behind the CDU, but now we’re neck and neck.” He added he was “damned proud” of his party.
Baerbock called the result “wonderful”. “We held an election campaign that we’d never had before,” she said, addressing party members in Berlin, flanked by her co-leader, Robert Habeck. But, she added: “We can’t just cheer – we wanted more.” She admitted to mistakes, which she said were her fault, at the start of the campaign, but added: “We have a clear task for the future” – pledging to help create what she called a “climate government”.
Katrin Göring-Eckhardt, a leading Green party politician, said that even if her party had hoped for a better result – it was once polling at 27% – it was celebrating a success. “This is the vote of a generation that wants change,” she said, pointing out that many younger people had voted for the party.
“The task ahead is far bigger than any election,” she added, referring to the challenge to tackle the climate emergency, and promised that in government the Greens would deliver on the party’s promise for 100% of German energy to come from renewable sources.
This article was amended on 28 September 2021 to correct the figure relating to the performance of the Alternative für Deutschland party. AfD won 10.3% of the vote, as correctly indicated in the table of provisional results, rather than 11% as the text elsewhere said."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/27/germany-election-what-happens-next-as-parties-vie-to-form-government;2021-09-27;Germany election: what happens next as parties vie to form government;"Outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel could remain in post for weeks or months while parties attempt to cobble together a coalition
The two main rivals vying to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor have each said they will try to head the next government. So what happens next?
Germany’s chancellor is not directly elected but chosen through a vote in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, after a government has been formed. Merkel could remain in her post for weeks if not months while parties try to cobble together a coalition.
After years of two-party coalitions, three parties will probably be needed this time to achieve a majority – common in Germany’s regional parliaments but not seen at the national level since the 1950s.
In most parliamentary systems, the head of state nominates a party to form a government – usually the party that has won the biggest share of the vote.
But in Germany, all parties can embark on what are known as “exploratory talks”.
In this initial phase, which has no time limit, there is nothing to stop the parties from all holding coalition talks in parallel, although tradition dictates that the biggest party will invite smaller ones for discussions.
But Armin Laschet, the chancellor candidate from Merkel’s centre-right CDU-CSU bloc, said on Sunday that the conservatives would “do everything we can” to lead the next government, even after preliminary results put them a touch behind the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).
His SPD rival Olaf Scholz, the country’s finance minister, said voters wanted a change and for “the next chancellor to be called Olaf Scholz”.
The Greens have already called a party congress for next Saturday, 2 October, during which they could decide with whom they would take up exploratory talks.
Discussions will begin as soon as the results are in, with the parties looking to discover each other’s red lines and establish whether they can work together.
On Monday, the day after the election, the parties will hold leadership meetings. The newly elected MPs from each party will also hold their first meetings next week, with the SPD and CDU-CSU planning to convene on Tuesday.
The pro-business FDP party, which like the Greens could play a kingmaker role, has said it has a preference for a coalition with the conservatives and the Greens, but a three-way alliance with the SPD and Greens remains on the table too.
The newly elected parliament must hold its inaugural session no later than 30 days after the election, on 26 October.
If two or three parties agree in principle that they would like to form an alliance, they must then begin formal coalition negotiations, with various working groups meeting to thrash out policy issues.
At the end of these negotiations, the parties decide who will be in charge of which ministry and sign a coalition contract, a thick document setting out the terms of the agreement.
This phase also has no time limit, with the outgoing government holding the fort in the meantime.
The parties then nominate who they would like to be chancellor before the official vote in the Bundestag.
After Germany’s last election on 24 September 2017, Merkel was formally confirmed chancellor in a coalition between the CDU-CSU and the centre-left Social Democrats only on 14 March 2018.
According to article 63 of the German constitution, the head of state must propose a potential chancellor to the Bundestag.
If no cross-party alliance emerges, president Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the SPD may still nominate a potential chancellor, most likely from whichever party won the biggest share of the vote.
The parliament will then vote in a secret ballot, with the candidate needing an absolute majority.
If this is not achieved, a second vote will be held two weeks later. If there is still no absolute majority, there is then an immediate third vote in which a relative majority is enough.
The president then decides whether to appoint the chancellor as head of a minority government or to dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections.
This worst-case scenario was narrowly avoided in 2017: faced with an impasse in negotiations, Steinmeier urged the parties to meet again, pushing for the renewal of the so-called grand coalition."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/26/germany-election-worst-ever-result-momentarily-silences-cdu;2021-09-26;Germany election: worst ever result momentarily silences CDU;"Exit poll shows vote share of the conservative Christian Democratic Union on 25%
As the first exit poll flashed up on the screens inside the Konrad Adenauer Haus, the Berlin headquarters of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party faithful who had gathered in the central courtyard fell silent.
The black bar representing their conservative party showed up first: 25%, the worst result the dominant political force of modern German politics – the party of Angela Merkel, Helmut Kohl and Adenauer – has recorded in its history. Until today, the CDU’s low point was the 31% it gained at the first democratic vote in the postwar era, in 1949.
“Vote for what makes Germany strong”, urged a large banner outside the building, showing the head of CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet at the end of a line of era-defining chancellors. But tonight the CDU looked weak, and Laschet will face an uphill struggle to inherit the chancellory on the back of such a painful result.
The CDU not only has history on its side, however; it also has an uncanny inability to give up a fight. When the television screen showed the bar for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) revealing the two traditional broad-church parties to be neck-and-neck, there were yelps of relief.
By the time it was clear that a leftwing coalition between the SPD, the Greens and Die Linke would on first exit polls not have enough support for a governing majority, young Christian Democrats were cheering and clapping with their hands in the air.
When Laschet took to the stage at his party HQ at shortly before 7pm CET, his speech was almost upbeat: “We knew this would be an open and tight election,” he said. “We can’t be happy with the result, but this will be a long evening.”
Like Olaf Scholz, the SPD candidate, he laid a claim to lead the next government. Every vote for his party was a vote against a leftwing government, he said, “which is why we will do everything to form a government under the leadership of the [Christian Democratic] Union”.
During the Merkel era, Germany’s conservatives had long looked immune to the erosion in support suffered by other traditional parties of the centre right across Europe. In 2013, the chancellor shored up 41.5% of the national vote behind her party, an emphatic win reminiscent of the middle of the 20th century, when Germany was a de-facto two party state.
Now that the CDU has caught up with the rest of Europe, it is unclear what the ramifications will be. Rightwingers in the party will blame Merkel for gutting her conservative outfit of its old ideological core, leaving her successor to pick up the mess. Centrist will say the ideological core has had little to offer to a modern German electorate, and that it was only thanks to Merkel’s skill that the party managed to remain popular for so long.
Many will point a finger at Laschet, who ran a campaign that lacked focus, energy and a coherent message. The lackadaisical air that has followed him throughout the campaign trail was evident even on the day of the vote: as Laschet posed in front of photographers at the polling station, it was obvious that he had folded his ballot the wrong way around, so his own vote was clear for everyone to see.
Many commentators will argue that the CDU would have won a clear victory if it had picked as its candidate Markus Söder, the highly energetic and waspish state premier of Bavaria. Sunday’s result in Germany’s south throws a question mark over such received wisdom: the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, looked on course to get 33% of the vote in the conservative stronghold, the second worst result in its history.
As the Christian Democratic Union’s members digested the result on Sunday night, eyes turned to the result in the electoral district number 196.
The constituency, in an unspectacular part of the eastern state of Thuringia, was seen by some as one battleground that could point to the party’s future: the CDU was represented here by Hans-Georg Maaßen, the former head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, who was forced to resign in 2018 after being accused of ignoring evidence of anti-immigrant riots in the east.
Maaßen sees his job as being to win back CDU voters who have drifted off to Alternative for Germany (AfD), mainly by coopting their agenda. On social media channels, he has railed against Merkel’s immigration policy, “economic globalists”, and a perceived takeover of the national media by leftwing activists.
The AfD sees it differently: it has hopes that Maaßen could open the door to future coalitions between the large conservative bloc and the far-right upstarts. One local AfD branch, in the city of Suhl, endorsed Maaßen over its own candidate, urging its supporters to vote for “a candidate with backbone and political experience”.
On Sunday night it looked like the Maaßen experiment had failed spectacularly: not only was the SPD on course to win the seat in district number 196, but the CDU rightwinger was trailing behind the AfD in third place.
The worst-case scenario for the Christian Democrats was always that its party would descend into infighting as soon as the clock struck 6 on Sunday, and be unfit to conduct coherent coalition talks in the coming weeks.
If the eventual result as close as it seems, and with no emboldened rival in sight, Laschet is likely to survive. His party will do its utmost to block out the historic nature of its defeat, and fight to keep alive its dream of providing the country with its next chancellor."

Polling stations have opened in Germany as the nation decides who will succeed in the race to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years.
As final rallies were held across the country by the the main candidates on Saturday, with polls showing the lead held by the Social Democrats’ Olaf Scholz over Armin Laschet of the Christian Democrats to have narrowed to a tiny margin, voter participation among the more than 60 million Germans eligible to vote, was predicted to be high.
The Greens, under Annalena Baerbock, which at one point had led in the polls, were on track to secure third place, and are expected to find themselves in government for the first time since 2005.
The departure of Merkel – the first incumbent chancellor to not run for office again since the second world war, has left the contest far more volatile and incalculable than ever before. A large number of Germans were still believed to be undecided even in the hours ahead of polling day.
Due to the pandemic, about 40% – a record number – of voters have already cast their ballot in a postal vote.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president, said Germany faced a “political transition” and urged citizens to use their vote to determine “how the country continues to deal with both the small and large questions of our time”.
“Democracy thrives on intervention and participation. Those who participate will be heard. Those who don’t vote are allowing others to decide for them,” he wrote in a guest commentary for the Bild am Sontag tabloid.
The climate emergency has been a key topic during the campaign, with activists at Fridays for Future demonstrations across the country on Friday appealing to a new government to put tackling the global climate crisis at the top of its agenda. Ahead of polls opening, two remaining campaigners from a group that had been on hunger strike in a camp next to the Bundestag since 30 August called off their strike after Scholz agreed to a public meeting with them in four weeks’ time.
The polls opened at 88,000 voting stations around the country at 8am and will close at 6pm, with the first exit polls due to be published at the same time.
The lead candidates are due to hold a so-called “Elephant Round”, a live round-table TV debate about the future make-up of the government, at 8.15pm local time.
But clarity is not expected even once the final results are known. A coalition government is an inevitability, but for the first time in more seven decades it is expected to be made up of three parties, leading to months of complicated and heated negotiations between them.
Merkel will stay in office in a caretaker role until the new government takes power, which could take weeks or even months.
The party that achieves the best result will not automatically lead the government but will have to court the runners-up to join them in power. The Green party, which has previously shared power with the Social Democrats in national government, is expected to be a key kingmaker, along with the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP), which has traditionally been a natural partner for the conservative alliance.
The most likely coalitions are:
A traffic-light coalition – reflecting the parties’ trademark colours – between the SPD, Greens and FDP.
A Jamaica alliance (the parties’ colours matching those of the Jamaican flag) made up of the CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP.
Or a so-called ‘Red-Red-Green’ coalition between the SPD, Greens and the far-left Die Linke.
Under Germany’s proportional representation system, each voter has two votes. The first is for a direct candidate in one of the 299 constituencies that gives each district parliamentary representation.
The second vote is for a party and determines the composition of the Bundestag.
Parties must secure 5% of votes to be able to enter the Bundestag.
The size of the future parliament will only be determined once the votes are in, after adjustments are made to allow for the difference between the number of directly elected representatives and the results of the second vote to be taken into account.
But due to the number of direct candidates on track to win, it is expected the Bundestag could rise from the current all-time high of 709 seats to as many as 900. Election analysts have predicted a “horror scenario” that will not only be a challenge for those who have to organise the furniture but lead to an explosion in costs as well as complicating parliamentary business.
Under new rules, among those eligible to vote for the first time are 85,000 people with disabilities who will be allowed to enter the voting booth accompanied by a legal guardian."

But what has been her impact on politics across Europe and on the global stage?
The filmmaker and gay rights activist Rosa von Praunheim once confessed that he loved Angela Merkel, but hated her Christian Democratic Union party.
This sense of Merkel as a morally attractive, quasi-presidential figure above petty partisanship is widely shared within Germany and abroad: during the Donald Trump years she was lauded as the last defender of the liberal international order; Boris Johnson described her last week as a “titan” of diplomacy; and even Alexis Tsipras, the hapless leftwing Greek prime minister who was forced by Merkel into years of austerity, cannot help but admire her “sincerity”.
A contrasting narrative of Merkel as an opportunist with no real political convictions but a portrait of Catherine the Great above her desk and a metaphorical dagger underneath to stab male rivals in the back has largely disappeared.
This story was always sexist nonsense. But the apotheosis as the world’s last decent leader is too good to be true: yes, Merkel was successful in keeping her own party, various large coalitions, and the EU together at crucial moments. But she could only do so because, during a boom based on German exports, there was always enough money to buy everyone’s consent. While future historians are likely to marvel at her tactical skills in micropolitics, they may also conclude that she was uniquely placed globally to have done more on the climate emergency – and simply failed to do so.
As Germany’s first female chancellor prepares to step down, Merkelologists have been busy again ruminating about the deeper reasons for her unique style of governing: cautious, oriented towards consensus, pragmatic – the list is by now well known, if not outright cliched.
Might it have something to do with Protestantism (which made her a savvy outsider in a party profoundly shaped by co-founder Konrad Adenauer’s Rhenish Catholicism)? Is it her background as a physicist, predestining her to be the obvious antidote to the world’s science deniers, especially a certain former American president? Or is it all best explained by her upbringing in East Germany, which taught her not to trust too easily and talk as little as possible?
The truth is more banal. Merkel at one point did commit to a bold vision – and almost saw her political career end as a result. In 2005 she campaigned on a neoliberal platform of a flat tax, cuts in the welfare state, and ever more “flexible labour markets”; the federal election was hers to lose to Gerhard Schröder, who was deeply unpopular at that point. And lose she almost did.
That was the beginning of Merkelism as a political method: rather than make yourself vulnerable by prominent programmatic commitments (let alone rousing rhetoric in defence of them), observe carefully in which direction things are going, identify interests that might converge at one point, then occupy that point and claim that you were leading people there all along. She had once wanted to be the German Margaret Thatcher; instead, she decided to be all things to all people.
Tellingly, Merkel was happy to be celebrated at Harvard University as a great liberal promoter of marriage equality when she had actually voted against same-sex marriage in the Bundestag.
She adopted many policies, such as the minimum wage pushed by Social Democrats during the latter’s coalition with the Christian Democrats, and then sold them as her success – thus perfecting the art of what came to be known as “asymmetric demobilisation”: making sure supporters of other parties do not bother to vote, because they have been lulled into a sense that “Mutti” has taken care of everything already. This ecumenical approach was made easier by a kind of windfall profit: Schröder, marching down his very own version of the “third way”, had already implemented tough – critics would rightly say cruel – labour market policies, creating a large low-wage sector. Meanwhile, the euro made German exports cheaper; in combination with high demand from China, this meant golden years with high revenues for the German state, and little reason to make tough choices.
Merkel never took risks at moments of her own choosing: only crises forced her out of the politics-as-small-scale-problem-solving mode. But even when the house was on fire, she would sometimes wait and see how the mood of local spectators was developing: major Eurocrisis decisions were made with an eye on Landtag elections in Germany itself.
To be fair, crises allowed Merkel to initiate major changes, such as phasing out nuclear power in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster – after having first reversed the decision of the previous Red-Green government to end nuclear, a zigzagging that cost billions of euros.
Not all crises were political bolts out of the blue. Today, leftwingers around the globe treat Merkel as a saint who “opened the borders” for refugees. No doubt, Merkel put a lot on the line in autumn 2015; it was also a rare moment when she explicitly invoked her Christianity to justify why those in dire need had to be welcomed with open arms.
But the crisis had longterm causes, of course: Merkel had for years been fighting against a fairer European asylum system; she had also used the term Flüchtlingsbekämpfung (combat against refugees) which sounded like Schädlingsbekämpfung (pest control) and thus appeared to associate deterring refugees from crossing the Mediterranean with controlling pests.
For the writer Navid Kermani, Merkel’s remark in September 2015 that she had not realised the conflicts in Syria and Iraq could end up affecting the Heimat (homeland) so directly was an astonishing admission. It seemed that she would basically not get worried too much about anything, as long as all stayed quiet on the political home front.
After an acute crisis, Merkel would revert to her “radically reactive governing style”, as one Berlin journalist put it. There was little effort to improve safety or truly to rebuild once huge fires were no longer blazing. The “energy turn” away from nuclear power quickly became an administrative mess.
When the French president Emmanuel Macron, in a grand speech at the Sorbonne in 2017, pleaded with Merkel to build a more coherent EU architecture after the Eurocrisis, Merkel politely ignored him. She half-heartedly tried to find a different European approach to refugees – but then dropped the issue and rested content with paying off the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and assorted Libyan warlords to warehouse (or worse) refugees outside the walls of fortress Europe.
Only when the pandemic hit was Merkel again willing to take a daring step – issuing bonds backed by the EU as a whole. What famously made British prime minister Harold Macmillan’s job so difficult – “events, dear boy, events” – were the occasions when Merkel was for once willing to do what she had probably known all along was right, but politically seemed risky unless shrouded in the fog of an immediate crisis.
Merkel’s famous formula Fahren auf Sicht – driving without being able to see too far ahead (let alone having a GPS) – made for safe-enough journeys; but when it comes to the climate emergency, it would probably take the world over the cliff. Or so young German activists have been complaining for years, with Merkel defending herself by patiently explaining that politics consists of “what is possible”.
But what is possible has of course also depended on Merkel. After all, she is a scientist with superb analytical abilities to break down large problems into specific policy changes; she had been a minister for the environment in the mid-nineties and her anti-charisma has by now turned into a particular kind of charisma which instantly communicates sincerity (comparable to the effect young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has on certain audiences). Merkel was thus uniquely well placed to mobilise both national and international publics – but never did.
It turns out there is no such thing as leading from the back on climate.
The limits of Merkelism also became apparent during the pandemic. In spring 2020, the usual narrative about Merkel the rational problem-solver was deployed to explain why Germany had escaped relatively unscathed from the first wave. But by winter, her consensus-seeking style had produced literally fatal delays. Night-long meetings with the heads of the individual federal states about the right policies turned into a cartoonish version of EU summits: bleary-eyed politicians would announce an agreement, only to have it immediately undermined by colleagues who supposedly had shared the consensus. Chaos and confusion resulted.
Merkel’s CDU – a bit like the Tories – has long lived off a nimbus of competence and being the default party of government. The management of the pandemic hurt that image; the long months of lockdown also gave Germans time to contemplate just how far they have fallen behind in infrastructure, education and basically anything to do with the internet; obsessed with balanced budgets, Merkel-led governments simply failed to provide public investment.
Conventional wisdom has it that Merkelism has left her party an intellectually hollow shell. But it’s hard to argue that anybody has really articulated a 21st century vision of Christian democracy anywhere. That is one reason why so many centre-right parties – think of Sebastian Kurz’s People’s party Christian Democrats in Austria – have effectively mainstreamed the far right: without ideas of their own, and no clear sense of where the boundaries between centre-right and the far right should be drawn, nominally mainstream leaders have been busy accommodating nativism or even outright racism in countries such as France and the Netherlands.
In this respect, and to her credit, Merkel did hold it together. She made some remarks about how multiculturalism had “utterly failed” when, a decade ago, it became fashionable to do so. But she also dismissed, with characteristic understatement, a 2010 bestseller that put the fear of being replaced by Muslim invaders into Germans with the words: “not helpful”.
To be sure, her words might have been stronger, and her stance should have been clearer when it came to foreign far-right populists. She was happy to keep the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, in the European People’s party, the supranational association of European centre-right and Christian Democratic parties, while the latter was busy hollowing out Hungarian democracy.
The reason is simply that German industry – the powerful car manufacturers in particular – has long been cuddled by Budapest.
Merkel was always more outspoken with Vladimir Putin, and when she first went to Beijing in 2006, she sought to push for “more openness and more freedom”. A year later, she invited the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery. But, as Germany’s dependence on Chinese markets grew, her government turned quieter and quieter; and one of Merkel’s last major initiatives was an EU-China investment pact that pays scant attention to human rights.
Still, even critics will concede her fundamental decency on many occasions. And her fans will remind us that, if nothing else, she is a thoroughly uncorrupt politician; it is hard to imagine her cashing in as a lobbyist or even just on the speaking circuit. Then again, the fact that such self-restraint becomes a matter of moral merit might just show how little we expect from leaders today.
This article was amended on 8 October 2021. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Angela Merkel had “abstained” from a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage; in fact, she voted against the legislation.

Angela Merkel’s long goodbye as Germany’s chancellor finally draws to a close this weekend as votes in the federal election are tallied – at least in theory. If the latest opinion polls are to be believed, there will be no clear winner. No party is expected to command an overall Bundestag majority. Coalition talks on forming a new government could take months. In the meantime, in practice, Merkel remains in charge.
The uncertainty over who will replace her is a big change from the often predictable politics of the past 16 years. But it would not do to get overexcited. Neither Olaf Scholz, who leads the Social Democrats (SPD), the biggest centre-left party, nor Armin Laschet, Merkel’s conservative choice as her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) successor, offers radically different agendas. Both men stress continuity while promoting modest, incremental change.
This is a problem. The campaign highlighted pressing issues that were ignored during the Merkel era. One is pension reform for an ageing population. Another is inadequate public investment in healthcare, utilities, housing and broadband. Recent floods in western Germany revealed a lack of structural resilience. Critics say Merkel has done far too little to address climate change.
Would a hypothetical Scholz-led ruling coalition including the Greens and the pro-business Liberals (FDP) have sufficient clout and unity of purpose to tackle such challenges? Would a similar combination of parties led by Laschet? It’s possible the Greens leader, Annalena Baerbock, could yet emerge on top, but her ability to effect real change is also circumscribed by her need for allies.
The risk for German democracy amid all this horse-trading is that a resulting weak, compromise coalition may disappoint and alienate and push frustrated voters towards the extremes represented by the far-left Die Linke and the far-right AfD. Neither party is expected to do particularly well this time. But that may change if a post-Merkel government serves up more of the same.
That would be bad news for Germany but also for Europe and Britain, which both need a strong, confident partner in Berlin. Merkel, a consummate consensus-builder, helped hold the EU together during successive financial, migrant and pandemic crises. On the other hand, she famously lacked strategic vision. She far preferred cutting energy and trade deals with Russia and China to confronting the authoritarian threat they pose.
Both Scholz and Laschet advocate closer integration with the EU. Both support the creation, in parallel to Nato, of a European army and defensive union. Unlike anti-American pacifists to her left, Baerbock also backs Nato, urges a tougher line towards Beijing and Moscow and wants a “values-driven foreign policy”. She says the EU must be “self-reliant” as the US alliance grows less predictable.
Yet it’s unclear whether any of these chancellor candidates will throw their weight fully behind President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas about EU “strategic autonomy” or how far they might go towards fiscal and economic union, ideas Merkel always kept at arm’s length. In Scholz’s case, there are potential tensions, too, with Ursula von der Leyen, the German EU commission president and longtime Merkel crony.
In the absence of a strong lead from Berlin, Macron may try to expand his influence over the EU’s future direction. But a difficult re-election battle in April will distract and could even defeat him. The greater danger is paralysis within the EU, matching that in Germany, over the big geopolitical, climate, trade, energy and technology challenges it faces – and a rising risk of internal fragmentation.
All this could negatively affect Britain, which will rely on German goodwill and common sense if it is ever to forge a rational post-Brexit political and security relationship with Brussels and resolve disputes over trade, Northern Ireland and cross-Channel migrants. Merkel provided both. Her successor, whoever that is, may not do so."

Germany is braced to enter a new “Dutch-style” political era after federal elections on Sunday, as a knife-edge vote points to months of complicated coalition wrangling.
Outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel joined the campaign trail at a rally in the western city of Aachen on Friday night in an attempt to help her designated successor from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Armin Laschet, close the gap on the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD).
“We need a stable government,” Laschet told the crowd at the event in his home city. “If you want stability for Germany, the CDU-CSU [Christian Social Union] have to be in first place tomorrow.”
“We will turn this game around,” vowed the conservative Bavarian state premier, Markus Söder, at the event in the southern German state capital. Germany, he warned, must not become an “experimental site for leftwing tomfoolery”.
A lacklustre, at times unfocused campaign has seen the CDU trailing a resurgent SPD for the last month, though polling in the past few days has seen the gap between the two traditional broad-church parties tighten slightly. The last opinion survey to be published, by pollster Allensbach on Friday, showed the centre-left ahead by a whisker on 26% of the vote, followed by the centre-right on 25%. In others polls, the gap was also too narrow to be statistically significant.
Yet even if Sunday’s outcome were to reflect the predictions, the two Volksparteien – people’s parties – are mere shadows of the electoral forces they used to be in their heydays of the 1970s, when they shored up 90% of the national vote between them.
Instead, the vote is certain to yield a more even spread of parliamentary seats in the Bundestag than at any previous election in modern Germany, with the SPD or the CDU likely requiring the support of two more parties to build a governing majority. (A repeat of the grand coalition that has governed the country for the last eight years, even with hierarchies reversed, is seen as unlikely.)
While either the CDU’s Laschet or SPD candidate Olaf Scholz may receive standing ovations from their party faithful on Sunday, the strongest party on the night will not automatically get to field the next chancellor, and two second-tier parties are likely to rise on Monday with new kingmaker powers.
The pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) used to be a traditional junior partner of the German conservatives, while the Green party has previously shared power with the Social Democrats. But in this year’s campaign they have already signalled their openness to adventures new.
“It is right that things would be easier for us with the [Christian Democratic] Union and the Greens than with the SPD and the Greens,” said the FDP leader, Christian Lindner, on Friday, expressing a preference for a “Jamaica” coalition – so called because the parties’ traditional colours mirror those of the Jamaican flag.
In a televised debate the night before, however, Lindner also hinted that he could see himself as the rightwing corrective in an otherwise left-leaning coalition: “The FDP will enter a coalition of the centre,” said the aspirant next finance minister. “There will be no green debts and red tax rises with us.”
The Green party’s lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, has similarly expressed a preference for a pact with the SPD – without categorically ruling out joining a R2G (“red-green-red”) coalition that includes the far-left Die Linke, or one with the two centre-right parties: “A government without the Greens is like climate without protection,” she said on Thursday night.
“The political camps of old will have to move beyond their red lines,” noted an article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “Forming a government this time will be complicated, protracted and potentially explosive.”
The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), forecast to get 10%-11% of the vote, is the only party to have been ruled out as a coalition partner by all the other bigger parties.
With six parties expected to make up Germany’s parliament next term, the country is still a far cry from the Netherlands, where a record 17 parties entered the lower house after a national vote in March.
Still, Germany is likely to take its time to explore the unfamiliar dynamics of a changing political landscape. While the next Bundestag will have to convene for the first time by 26 October, there is no time limit on government formation, and no set rules on the order or format of coalition talks, which could theoretically take place in parallel. After the 2017 election, it took Merkel more than five months to form a government, a record in the history of the federal republic. That the German chancellor will still be in office in a caretaker role by Christmas seems more than likely."

The race to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor remains completely open two days before western Europe’s most populous country goes to the polls, with the latest predictions showing the leading parties almost neck and neck.
Two leading polls published on Friday ahead of Sunday’s election indicate the Social Democrats (SPD) have lost their lead over the Christian Democrats (CDU). One, carried out by Civey for the broadcaster ZDF, showed the SPD to be stable on 25%, but the CDU to have risen to 23%. A poll released later in the day for the polling institute Allensbach for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung showed the race to be even tighter, with the SPD on 26%, the CDU on 25%.
The SPD had been on a roll for weeks but has seen its lead whittled down to such a wafer-thin majority that its advantage is in effect non-existent, especially when a statistical margin of error of about 2.5% is also taken into account.
The battle for the runner-up is almost as open, and is being followed just as closely by punters, as it could be as, if not more decisive, in determining the make-up of the new government. The Green party is shown in the final polls to be on 16% and the FDP on 10.5% to 12%. The far-right AfD is on 10% followed by the far-left Die Linke on 5% to 6%, which means it is on the verge of not being reelected into parliament.
However, by a considerable margin, the most popular candidate for chancellor remains Olaf Scholz of the SPD, with 47% of those polled saying they would choose him if there was a direct vote for chancellor, while 20% said they were in favour of Armin Laschet of the CDU. Just 16% said they wanted Annalena Baerbock of the Greens.
A coalition government seems an inevitability and a three-way alliance is highly likely, the first time this will have happened on a national level, in a reflection of the increasing fragmentation of German politics that is also occurring elsewhere in Europe and beyond.
The resulting scenario will have wide-reaching consequences for how a new government operates as well as affecting Germany’s future role as a leading voice in Europe. Weeks, if not months, of heated negotiations over forming a new government are expected.
On Thursday night, the lead candidates of all seven parties expected to enter the Bundestag met for a final television debate, in which they sparred over the issues that have shaped the campaign, from economic recovery to climate change, pandemic management to energy security. But the gathering was too large, the time each candidate had too brief, to allow any one of them to make a significant impact.
The debate followed three previous encounters over the past month with the leaders of the CDU, SPD and Greens, after which audience polls had declared Scholz, the SPD leader, to be the winner on each occasion.
Thursday night’s debate opened with focus on the fatal shooting earlier this week of a petrol station attendant in Rheinland-Palatinate after he had asked a customer to wear the mandatory medical face mask, an incident that has shocked Germany.
It triggered discussion on a wide range of security issues including the tightening of gun laws, online hate speech and arguments over the necessity of the coronavirus restrictions still in place across Germany.
The collapse in support for the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been the main talking point throughout this campaign, with much blame especially within the conservative alliance itself having been put at the door of its candidate, Laschet, who is also the leader of Germany’s most populous state of North Rhein-Westphalia (NRW).
His campaign has been gaffe-prone – its lowest point came shortly after the floods that wreaked havoc in NRW and neighbouring Rheinland-Palatinate, when Laschet was caught on camera laughing during a moment of remembrance for the more than 180 people who died. His own party is perceived as being drained, empty of innovation or inspiration after 16 years in power under Merkel.
Even if the CDU catches up on the SPD, it is still on course for one of the worst results in its almost eight-decade history.
Relative to the CDU, the SPD has appeared to flourish, though even within the party itself its advantage is put down to some extent to a mix of luck and circumstance that could evaporate at any moment. Scholz, as incumbent finance minister who has helped steer the German economy through the pandemic, has presented himself as something of a continuity candidate to Merkel – even briefly adopting her famous rhomboid hand gesture, which, while meant as a joke, has gone down well with the electorate – at the same time as promising a change of course and widespread reform.
However, when it comes to the votes it has garnered over the past two decades, the SPD, like the CDU, remains a shadow of its former self as it has haemorrhaged supporters to other parties.
The party also remains haunted by the rise and fall of Martin Schulz, the former president of the European parliament who had stood as the party’s chancellor candidate in 2017 and had initially been on a roll before the SPD fell to a postwar low in the election.
The Greens have not escaped a bumpy ride throughout the campaign, having dropped from 28% in April after Baerbock was appointed its lead candidate, to 16%. Despite environmental issues being its raison d’être, the party has failed to benefit from recent environmental disasters, including Germany’s historic floods. In fact, it has actively resisted appearing to want to do so – even its own supporters accuse it of having shied away from seizing the reins over outlining the scale and challenge of the climate emergency.
Nevertheless, the Greens are very likely to play a significant role in any new government, in shaping future environmental policy as Germany struggles to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement to reduce its carbon emissions.
On Friday, thousands of campaigners for Fridays for Future gathered in Berlin joined by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, accusing the traditional parties of failing to take the climate emergency seriously and demanding the new government do so.
One of their key requests is for what it calls “generational justice” – young people make up the smallest group of voters and parties are perceived to have shaped their manifestos to appeal to the older generation who are statistically less interested in environmental concerns.
Nearby, in a camp outside the Bundestag, a group of climate emergency campaigners calling themselves The Last Generation, entered the 25thday of a hunger strike. They are demanding a public audience with the three main candidates for chancellor ahead of polling day and calling for the establishment of a citizens’ assembly for climate policy."

Germans go to the polls this Sunday to elect a new Bundestag, or federal parliament. The result – after coalition negotiations likely to involve two or three parties – will decide who will succeed Angela Merkel, who is standing down after 16 years as chancellor.
A two-way coalition between the conservative CDU and the German Greens had long looked the most likely outcome, but in recent weeks the SPD’s Olaf Scholz has performed well in televised debates and his party has taken a lead in the latest polls.
German federal elections are proportional, so the share of vote given by polling companies should be read as translating fairly directly into share of seats in the resulting parliament. Only parties with less than 5% of the national vote, or less than three directly elected constituency seats, are not awarded proportional parliamentary seats.
German political commentary has conventional names for potential coalitions, including GroKo for the “grand coalition” of CDU and SPD. A possible CDU-FPD-Green coalition is referred to as “Jamaica” because the party colours are more or less those of the Jamaican flag. For consistency, these coalitions are simulated using the latest polling averages as above. But depending on how many votes go to small parties that do not cross the 5% threshold for seats in parliament, the bigger parties may get slightly more seats than their vote share suggests.
Because coalitions are the norm in Germany, most are possible, but the other parties have traditionally said they would not enter coalition with the AfD, and there has never yet been a federal coalition involving Die Linke.
Polling data is taken from Wahlrecht.de. Then the Guardian calculates an unweighted 14-day moving average, featuring only the latest poll from each of seven pollsters within the 14-day period.
The coalition chart on this page was updated on 13 September 2021 to show estimated % share of seats by party, rather than raw average party share in the polls. This number is a better indicator of a party’s chances to form a governing coalition.
An earlier version of this article was amended on 25 May 2021. The earlier version erroneously stated that parties obtaining less than 5% of the national vote need to win at least one constituency seat to be awarded proportional parliamentary seats. The correct number is three constituency seats, this has now been amended."

Sixteen years is a very long time in politics, and since 2005 we’ve had Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron (and Nick Clegg), Theresa May and Boris Johnson – while the Germans have just had Angela Merkel. It usually takes time to get the hang of drawing a politician, particularly one from a foreign country, and Merkel was no exception. I’d only just about got a handle on the SPD’s Gerhard Schröder when he was replaced by the CDU’s first female leader, and my first attempts were a little shaky and somewhat speculative. Was she a Thatcherite? Would she be pro-Bush, like Blair, or continue Schröder’s opposition to the war in Iraq? Would she be easy to draw?
She turned out to be interesting rather than easy, with large, generous features, hooded, quite kindly eyes with splendid bags under them, a prominent, rounded chin, and jowls to die for. One has to be very careful while drawing her that she does not come out looking like Kenneth Clarke. I must confess now that I’ve always found her hugely attractive – unlike Clarke – and her features always put me in mind of a particular old friend. Conservative she may have been, but definitely not a Thatcher. She seemed far too rational and pro-Europe for that.
The first cartoon in which I actually managed to get a grip on her likeness was in 2006, where, unusually, she appeared as a dog. In a reworking of Briton Rivière’s Victorian masterpiece Sympathy, the role of the little girl on the stairs is taken by George W Bush. Merkel, ever the pragmatist, was far less critical of Bush’s foreign policy disasters than her predecessor, though by no means as slavish as Blair, who is jealous, having had his nose up Bush’s arse for the preceding six years.
Europe is a constant theme when it comes to Merkel, particularly what she would see as her spirited and principled defence of the nascent single European currency. Others, however, may have interpreted her as Europa, screwing the Greeks rather than the bull, and this is where the figure of the dominatrix of austerity, carrying a whole display team of gimps, comes into play.
Helmut Kohl, her gigantic predecessor as CDU chancellor and former mentor, often fell into the same role, in a leather one-piece bathing suit, fishnet tights and cute pickelhaube helmet – with, in his case, even more disastrous consequences for the inhabitants of the former Yugoslavia, rather than the Greeks.
For me, Merkel’s finest hour, after her extremely guarded response to Cameron’s feeble attempts to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the European Union, came in response to the terrible refugee crisis of 2015 to 2016. Instead of closing the borders, she offered to receive one million new migrants. Though laudable, as a conservative politician this caused her severe electoral problems and a challenge from the far right at home.
She narrowly held on to power in 2017 in coalition with the SPD, but announced that she would not be standing for a fifth term, which brings us neatly up to date with a reprise of Sympathy in 2019, where a much older Merkel takes on the role of the girl on the stairs forced to bear the attentions of the monstrous Arse Dog Johnson, getting Brexit done all over the carpet. Emmanuel Macron looks on in disgust.

Among the repertory company of political actors cartoonists feature in their output, we can’t help developing favourites, and often feel a sense of personal loss when they inevitably shuffle off the world stage. This is wholly divorced from either sympathising with or viscerally loathing the politics – or even, quite often, the individual. It’s just the buzz we get from drawing them.
When John Major resoundingly lost the 1997 election, Steve Bell told me he had lost his reason for living because of the Zen-like karmic thrill he got from doing the holes in Major’s airtex underpants. Likewise, George Osborne’s departure from frontline politics still has me grieving: I loved drawing his head because it clearly has no bones in it. And I’m feeling a similar pang of regret at the imminent retirement of Angela Merkel, who I’ve been drawing regularly since 2008.
None of us, of course, can do much about the way we look, though public figures in positions of power often try – either through botox or Photoshop. But while Silvio Berlusconi’s eyebrows got pulled ever closer to his dyed hairline, it’s significant that the woman he described as “an unfuckable lard-arse” didn’t appear to be that bothered about the face life had dealt her, clearly part of her political shtick as an ordinary and homely Ossi who, nonetheless, quietly succeeded in dominating Europe for over a decade.
Her face, in fact, is rather lovely, with more than a hint of the young Iris Murdoch about it. To a cartoonist’s eye, however, she’s obviously the MGM cartoon dog Droopy’s long-lost twin sister. So her defining feature for me has always been the dolorous countenance of her face in repose. This, in turn, has informed the role she’s played in the satirical narrative I found myself creating around her. Small, hunched and apparently unobtrusive; often passively observing some other idiocy nearby; when active, appearing to act more in sorrow than anger.
Even when she was helping immiserate the lives of millions of southern Europeans, particularly in Greece, in the Euro crises from 2011-15, I drew her as morose rather than gleefully malevolent. Whether that reveals the inner truth doesn’t really matter: cartoons are journalism and therefore tend to be the first response to the immediate appearance of things.
But I reckon this portrayal does capture a hint of what, for want of a better term, we may call Merkel’s soul. As she endured in office, I caught a definite whiff of long-suffering discomfort coming off her as she stood uneasily next to cavalcades of clowns and crooks at international summits, or in any meeting with any representative of the British government over the past 11 years. She tried her not-very-good best to disguise the general air of toe-curling embarrassment choking the atmosphere in the room, all of which was etched so eloquently on her expressionless face. Thus, albeit unconsciously, Angela Merkel smiled insincerely and squirmed inside for us all, and for that alone we should salute her.

A four-storey house set a discreet distance away from Neuer Wall, Hamburg’s luxury designer strip, holds the secrets to Angela Merkel’s successful sartorial style.
Except that fashion designer Bettina Schoenbach, who has her studio here on ABC Strasse, has taken something of a vow of silence over her association with Merkel, who became her client after winning the 2005 election.
On her website, Schoenbach describes her philosophy. “Style is an expression of personal choices made many times over,” she states, adding that she is “dedicated to helping customers take strategic control of their image”. It is a remark that could be straight out of the lexicon of the pragmatic Merkel. Thanks to Schoenbach, Merkel has throughout her chancellorship, now drawing to a close, been able to open her wardrobe daily and assemble her outfit with two or three flicks of the wrist: the dream of many a working woman.
The designer does not talk to the media, but that is probably how she has retained her role as the creator of Merkel’s signature “uniform”, as it is often called: a jacket and a pair of dark-hued wide slacks, matched with a necklace, flat black shoes and a roomy Longchamp bag.
Merkel set out with the aim of avoiding drawing attention to her outward appearance, and the trademark blazer did the job, not unlike a doctor’s white coat. It is now synonymous with her political style: concrete, constant, without embellishment, but never dull. With a bell-like form, to fit what the late Karl Lagerfeld once referred to as her “special proportions”, the blazer typically has three or four buttons, always done up, and a round neckline, allowing space for the necklace. Sometimes with a collar and lapel, or pockets, sometimes without, Merkel is believed to have amassed several hundreds of the jackets over the years, in linen, silk, velvet and wool, mostly from Italian cloth, according to Germany’s fashion press. They have come in all shades of the rainbow, from soft pastels to flaming purples and oranges, and were made for every season and occasion – the duller colours such as white and beige reportedly reserved for the less spectacular meetings with dark-suited business leaders. Lavender, it has been suggested, was worn ahead of difficult meetings, perhaps with the intention of contributing to a relaxed mood.
In one of the few remarks she has made about her style, Merkel told the Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2015: “There are occasions on which I have to wear dark colours, then sometimes I’m informed that I will be standing in front of a white background, and for that the blazer has to have a lighter colour. And sometimes I’m simply in the mood to wear something bright and colourful.”
She has rarely worn patterns, and dresses were only ever seen when she made her annual trip to the opera in Bayreuth. The headlines that followed her appearance in 2008, when she wore a low-cut taffeta dress to the opening of Oslo’s Opera House, are said to have irritated her so much that she never repeated the experiment. Her spokesperson was confronted the following morning with the question as to who had designed the distinctive creation, to which he sputtered the reply that it was a “new composition from her existing wardrobe” (it was designed by Anna von Griesheim). In a 2013 TV debate, she wore a necklace in the colours of the German flag, which sparked such a heated debate about expressing national pride that she was never seen wearing it again.
Like her wardrobe in the days before Schoenbach came along, Merkel’s apparent lack of concern for her hair also drew scornful remarks early on, until a celebrity Berlin hairdresser taught how to blow-dry it, prompting the august Frankfurter Allgemeine to reveal the news that “Merkel no longer leaves her hair to dry naturally; she blow-dries it”. It wasn’t the first time a chancellor’s hair had made headlines. Merkel’s predecessor Gerhard Schröder dyed his, a media outlet dared to suggest, triggering a lawsuit from him and the forced withdrawal of the claim.
“I like the fact she has a recognisable style,” Anna Wintour, the editor of US Vogue told German media recently. “She appears to me like someone who knows who she is. I don’t have the impression she is trying to disguise herself.”"

Her departure raises big questions about the future
When Angela Merkel’s successor is identified in elections this Sunday, that person will be the first new holder of Europe’s most powerful elected office for 16 years. The mere change of leadership will be a shock for the whole continent. Germany is the EU’s foremost economic power (although France sees itself as a political equal).
That strength has generally been wielded with deference to the wider European interest. Or rather, the two interests have been conflated. A culture of atonement for the past has made Germany especially committed to the EU’s founding mission – peace and prosperity by means of cross-border integration. For the continent’s smaller members, that has sometimes felt like integration on terms dictated by Berlin, especially when it comes to budget austerity. European solidarity is the key to German foreign policy, but aversion to public debt is its sacred economic creed. That has made for uncomfortable diplomacy within the eurozone.
Tension over fiscal transfers flares whenever the conversation turns to the economic stability of the union, but the more insidious threat is the rise of illiberal nationalism, which risks making a mockery of the bloc’s foundational ideals. This is sometimes cast as a problem specific to former communist countries (Hungary and Poland being the worst offenders). But xenophobic rhetoric has encroached on the mainstream in nearly all European democracies.
With internal stresses testing solidarity, it is hard for the EU to focus outwards, although the global challenges are greater still. The affront felt in France at being bypassed in the formation of a new security pact between the US, the UK and Australia is not minor petulance. It speaks to strategic insecurity and is already reviving debates about the need for European defence autonomy. That subject also touches on historical sensitivities around German power.
It is one of the many tricky issues that Ms Merkel has avoided in her long tenure at the heart of European diplomacy. The last decade has seen the EU hit by the eurozone and the migration crises, as well as Brexit and the Trump presidency. A recent book by academics Jens Steffek and Leonie Holthaus, entitled Prussians, Nazis and Peaceniks, points to Germany’s dilemma of being pushed into an “international leadership role” while not actively seeking one.
To be trusted within the EU, Berlin needs to deal with the mismatch between domestic and international expectations of German foreign policy. So far, little has been done to ease the tension between an inward-looking electorate and Germany’s increasing power. Evasion of hard choices might prove to be Ms Merkel’s defining legacy. It is not always a flaw. The EU has defied many forecasts of failure. The resilience of the project is routinely underestimated by its critics, usually because they misdiagnose incremental progress as stasis or decline. The distinction can be hard to discern, and Ms Merkel has walked the boundary with skill.
Her reputation as a methodical pragmatist should be understood in the context of the convictions to which that pragmatism has been applied. In the EU, that has sometimes meant a zeal in maintaining institutional stability (and fiscal conservatism) at the expense of flexibility and adaptation to circumstance. If 27 countries want to move as one, they cannot do it quickly. But to stop moving altogether risks being overtaken by global events. The climate emergency demands radical and agile economic changes that do not come naturally to the EU.
The Merkel era, however, has been a triumph of neutralising crises, without quite resolving them. Given the scale of those challenges, deferral amounts to accomplishment, but it is an ambiguous legacy that bequeaths plenty of problems to a successor and leaves existential questions about Europe’s future unanswered."

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/22/post-angela-merkel-germany-elections-armin-laschet-cdu;2021-09-22;Germans undecided on whether Merkel’s CDU heir can fill her shoes;"Christian Democrat continuity candidate Armin Laschet is struggling to live up to his brief
Angela Merkel’s shoe size is 38, she revealed to a rain-sodden, momentarily confused audience at an election rally on the Baltic coast on Tuesday night. That is relatively small – 5.5 in UK sizes – which means her shoes should not be too hard to fill. “That’s manageable,” Merkel said.
As the German chancellor chuckled mischievously, she gestured towards the man on her left, a 33-year-old tax auditor who is running to inherit the north-eastern constituency she has held since it was created in 1990. But her comment also applied to the man on her right, Armin Laschet, who is meant to lead the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) into the post-Merkel era as her designated continuity candidate at Sunday’s national election.
Laschet, 60, is struggling to live up to his brief, with the CDU scrambling in polls behind the resurgent Social Democratic party (SPD) of the finance minister, Olaf Scholz. For the behemoth of postwar German politics to slump to second place after 16 years in power, possibly on no more than about 20% of the vote, would amount to nothing less than a political earthquake.
Tuesday’s rally in Stralsund was meant to be one of the last opportunities to turn the tide for Laschet’s campaign and send Merkel’s many admirers across the country into the voting booths full of enthusiasm for her chosen successor.
The mood music on the night was anything but promising. An ash grey sky brought gusts of wind and rain to Stralsund’s Alter Markt town square just as Merkel and entourage took to the stage. A small but noisy crowd of fewer than 50 anti-lockdown protesters chanting “Merkel muss weg” (“Merkel must go”) threatened to drown out the politicians’ speeches.
But the chancellor gave it her best. Laschet, she said, would fight to bring jobs into the structurally weak region in the formerly socialist east with the same dedication she had shown, while a leftwing coalition led by Scholz would “only think about how to distribute wealth, not generate it”.
Merkel warned that a left-leaning German government would run up joint debts with the rest of Europe not just temporarily, through the EU’s pandemic recovery package, but permanently, “which would not be good for Europe and become a great burden in a few years’ time”.
Still, fiery rhetoric has never been Merkel’s forte, and the line about her shoe size was the most memorable. In a typical Merkellian twist, she opted to express her support not by talking up the feats of a future chancellor Laschet, but by talking down her own.
The line of succession to Merkel’s tenure has been the source of speculation since her second term in office, when names whispered in Berlin’s corridors of power were the since-disgraced Bavarian defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, and Ursula von der Leyen, now the president of the European Commission.
Since then, that line has been redrawn, rubbed out and sketched anew so many times that its final destination looks less like a work of draftsmanship than the result of a slip of the pen.
Laschet has many qualities: the Rhinelander can be a great speaker, as he displayed in the speech that won him the CDU leadership in January this year; he is respectful towards those from other political tribes; like Merkel, he is easily underestimated and has sticking power. If he can make up a few percentage points before Sunday, he may still come to lead the next governing coalition.
Yet when he stands next to the chancellor, there is an overwhelming sense that Merkel’s small shoes may be too big for him.
Two weeks before the vote, the news weekly Der Spiegel ran a cover story entitled Das Laschet Disaster, in which it accused the CDU candidate of several strategic errors: a bitty political agenda, a lack of a coherent narrative about what he wants to do with the top job in German politics, and above all, a lack of focus.
“Laschet acts as if he was waiting to inherit Merkel’s power – and not to win support and votes,” Spiegel wrote.
The same lapses in concentration were apparent by the Baltic Sea on Tuesday night. Laschet praised Merkel’s record of bringing unemployment in the city down from 24.1% to under 8%, and vowed to “continue her work”.
But when he commiserated over the death of a 20-year-old petrol station worker at the hands of what appears to have been a militant anti-masker, he muddled up the date of the incident and his condemnation lacked gravitas. “You can argue about everything, you can have different opinions about corona[virus], but one must not hurt others,” Laschet said.
A small band of hardcore CDU supporters tried to respond to the ensuing jeers from the anti-vaxxers with a chant of Armin Laschet wird Kanzler (“Armin Laschet will be chancellor”) to the tune of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, but gave up soon after.
Should the CDU not emerge as the strongest force in the country on Sunday night, an almighty in-party reckoning beckons. The former finance minister and CDU veteran Wolfgang Schäuble gave a flavour of the resentments simmering beneath the surface last weekend when he already pinned the blame for Laschet’s struggles on the outgoing chancellor.
Faced with a growing mutiny insider her own party’s ranks, Merkel had handed over the leadership of the CDU to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in 2018 but held on to the chancellory. A mistake, Schäuble told Tagesspiegel newspaper, that had left the party able to claim neither that “everything will change” nor that “everything will stay the same”.
Others, in turn, blame Schäuble and other grandees such as the state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, who backed Laschet to become the carthorse of the CDU campaign over Markus Söder, the waspish Bavarian premier who looked fresher, more combative and popular than the Rhinelander when the party bloc made up its mind over the candidacy in the spring.
On Monday Söder was quick to defend Merkel, pointing to her impressive approval ratings. Laschet’s poor campaign, he said by implication, was of Laschet’s own making. Should the CDU come in second or level with the SPD, he is likely to soon put across that point in more unequivocal terms."

Angela Merkel’s 16-year tenure at the top of German politics will leave lasting legacies in many fields, but the art of political oratory is unlikely to be one of them. When the chancellor addresses the public she is rarely snappy and quotable, and she has even admitted she didn’t believe in governance by speech-making. “The idea that a person can touch other people so much with words that they change their minds is not one I have ever shared, but it’s a beautiful idea nonetheless,” she told Der Spiegel in 2016.
And yet during her decade and a half in power, which is set to end after Sunday’s election, there have been numerous additions to German dictionaries that sum up something about her leadership, be it phrases she used herself or those that others used to describe changes in the country she has led.
The rhombus shape that Merkel makes with her hands when facing cameras at summits or during visits of state became her trademark gesture more by accident than by design, or so the chancellor claims. “The question was always where should your arms go,” she once told Brigitte magazine. “And that’s how it came about.” Perhaps, she added, the Merkel-Raute also spoke of a “certain love for symmetry”. Before the 2013 election, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union embraced the rhomboid as the ultimate symbol of her power, renting a large banner outside Berlin’s central station with a mosaic of Merkel’s hands next to the slogan “Germany’s future in good hands”. Olaf Scholz, her would-be successor, was recently photographed for the cover of Süddeutsche Zeitung’s weekend supplement making the gesture, in a cheeky nod to his ambitions.
The word in Merkel’s vocabulary with the strongest whiff of old Prussia, ertüchtigen means to toughen up through physical exercise. The German chancellor has used the term repeatedly, especially through the eurozone crisis, to illustrate what she saw as the “old continent’s” need to modernise through economic reforms in order to be able to compete with China and the US.
A prime example of Denglisch, “public viewing” is an anglicism that snuck into the German language around the summer of 2006 when Germany hosted the football World Cup. It refers to the screening of tournament matches involving the men’s national team in public spaces such as Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate. During the Merkel era, supporting a successful Germany side became fashionable among a wider section of society than it used to be.
As the national side fought their way to the semi-finals or finals of six international tournaments in a row, supporting Germany at football also became increasingly enjoyed by the chancellor herself. Photos chart the blooming of a love affair: stiffly lining up with a tracksuited national squad in 2006; making her first unannounced visit to the post-match dressing room in 2010; and becoming the team’s unofficial mascot during the victorious 2014 World Cup campaign in Brazil. The wise-cracking striker Lukas Podolski memorably described her visits as a Muttivation, playing on the chancellor’s supposed role as the “mother of the nation”. Podolski earned laughs for his quip, but the term Mutti has been used less frequently in Germany than one may assume from the international coverage of her tenure. When used, it usually comes either with implied speech marks or a dose of macho paternalism. For a more genuine term of endearment, try Angie.
Stress-testing is used in medicine to show how the heart performs during physical activity. In the Merkel era, which was accentuated by a series of economic and geopolitical crises, a Stresstest became something that every structure needed to undergo, be it banks, governing coalitions or nuclear power stations. In 2011, when the chancellor decided to phase out all of Germany’s nuclear power stations by 2023, it was voted word of the year by the Association for the German Language.
Die Wende, “the turning point”, is how Germans refer to the events of autumn 1989, when the citizens of the German Democratic Republic rose in peaceful protest against the socialist regime. The term Energiewende refers not to a political system change but the transition to low-carbon or renewable energy sources. Die Wende took place over a few months – the Energiewende predates Merkel’s tenure and is still ongoing. The country has committed itself to becoming greenhouse gas-neutral by the year 2045.
Literally meaning “alternative-less”, alternativlos was Angela Merkel’s own version of a line usually associated with Margaret Thatcher: “There is no alternative.” But if “TINA” was specifically used to close down debates over alternatives to the market economy, Merkel’s government declared all type of policy decisions alternativlos: banking bailouts in response to the global financial crisis, military missions in Afghanistan, reducing the national debt. Her use of the phrase also inspired the naming of the first party to the right of her CDU to make it into the Bundestag: Alternative für Deutschland.
Between 2000 and 2007 a neo-Nazi terror group called the National Socialist Underground murdered 10 people in targeted attacks throughout Germany, most of them small business owners of Turkish or Kurdish origin. With police in the dark about the racist motivation behind the murders, German media tied them to gang warfare among the country’s German-Turkish population. Because İsmail Yaşar, the sixth victim, had owned a kebab shop, a Nuremberg newspaper referred to the killings as the Döner-Morde, or kebab murders; other newspapers wrote of a “kebab murderer” or “kebab killer”. The term lives on in ignominy for the way it dehumanised murdered people as mere meat, and as a shorthand for the blind eye the country turned to the activities of the far right. Two of the NSU’s members were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide after a failed bank robbery on 4 November 2011, finally shedding light on activity that had gone undetected for over a decade.
“Virgin territory” is how Merkel described the world wide web in 2013: “Das Internet ist für uns alle Neuland” – “the internet is virgin territory for all of us”. People scoffed at the phrase, as if the chancellor was finally waking up to digitalisation some 30 years after the Transmission Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) allowed computers on different networks to talk to each other. The phrase stuck also because Merkel’s governments never looked as if they pursued a coordinated strategy to heave Germany’s public administrative systems on to digital tracks. But context is important: Merkel’s spoke her line at a press conference after meeting the then US president, Barack Obama, to discuss the NSA’s bugging of her phone. Her wider point was that even though internet usage in 2013 was widespread, the legal ramifications of mass surveillance and cyber-espionage were still uncharted territory.
In the summer of 2015, when Merkel declined to close Germany’s borders to more than 1 million migrants and refugees who had mostly been uprooted by the war in Syria, the term “welcoming culture” was used to describe the upbeat attitude many Germans displayed towards the newcomers. About 55% of Germany’s population over the age of 16 volunteered to help in some form, a study later found, from giving people temporary accommodation in their homes to teaching German.
“Germany is a strong country,” Merkel told the media at a press conference in central Berlin on 31 August 2015, trying to address concerns about the steeply rising number of people applying for asylum in Germany that summer. “The motive with which we approach these matters must be: we have already managed so much, we’ll manage this.” Wir schaffen das became Merkel’s version of Obama’s “yes we can”: a casual, throwaway line that nonetheless spoke of her determination to take on the logistical and political challenges facing her at the time. As with alternativlos, the AfD tried to use Merkel’s language against her: “Wir wollen das gar nicht schaffen,” the AfD politician Alexander Gauland proclaimed at a party rally in October 2015 – “we really don’t want to manage this”.
Dating back to the 19th century, the phrase “liar’s press” entered wider usage in Germany in the first world war when it was used by German intellectuals railing against foreign newspapers’ coverage of the Kaiser’s colonial rule. In the 1930s the Nazis referred to Hitler’s critics as Lügenpresse apparatus. Eighty years later, the phrase washed back into Germany on the wave of a backlash against Merkel’s refugee policy among some parts of the population, chanted at anti-government demonstrations organised by the Pegida movement.
Merkel was Germany’s first Putinversteher, though only in the literal sense of “one who understands Putin”: having once been selected as East Germany’s third best student of the Russian language in her teens, she was able to exchange pleasantries and not-so-pleasantries with the Russian leader without a translator. In the more figurative sense, Putinversteher came to mean those such as her predecessor Gerhard Schröder who voiced sympathy with Russia’s position over the annexation of the Crimean peninsula and warned against European sanctions. For economic and geopolitical reasons, Germany has been far more equivocal about Putin’s Russia than Britain.
Used by the pollster Matthias Jung to describe the causes behind Merkel’s 2009 election success, “asymmetric demobilisation” describes an election strategy that functions on the basis of avoiding making statements on controversial topics, with the aim of demotivating political opponents or removing their firing power to the extent that they avoid tackling an issue or going to the polls. The term has since been used in relation to Merkel’s style of governance even in non-election periods, though Jung himself recently said the strategy was effectively rendered ineffective with the 2017 elections, in which Alternative für Deutschland entered parliament on an explicit anti-Merkel ticket.
The debate around “opening-up orgies” after Germany’s second lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic revealed a dividing line within Merkel’s party. The saying was coined in February 2021 by Winfried Kretschmann, the Green state premier of Baden-Württemberg. The chancellor was among those politicians, like Kretschmann, who warned that reopening shops, restaurants or bars too soon could backfire. Many Christian Democrats, including her designated successor, Armin Laschet, advocated a strategy of “living with the virus” and pushed to exit lockdown at the earliest opportunity.
Merkel’s training as a quantum chemist has frequently shaped her political vocabulary. Defending her pandemic management in front of Germany’s parliament in December 2020, the chancellor spoke of the danger of not sticking to concrete facts. “I decided to study physics in the GDR […] because I was quite sure that you can suspend a lot of things but not gravity, not the speed of light, even in the GDR,” she said. “Two and two makes four, even under [Erich] Honecker [the former East German leader].”
Asked by the journalist Moritz von Uslar which physical law also applied to politics, Merkel proposed the law of Schwerkraft, or gravity: “Without mass, no depth.”"

Angela Merkel is used to being unimpressed by British prime ministers. She was appalled by David Cameron’s casual surrender of influence in Europe, all to placate fringe elements in his party. She was stunned, on first sitting down with Theresa May, to discover that there was no plan and no substance behind the “Brexit means Brexit” platitudes.
With Boris Johnson there was no danger of disappointment. His style and methods were known in advance to be everything Merkel is not. He is a bumptious improviser; she is a systematic problem-solver. She sifts evidence and builds consensus. He tells lies and divides to rule.
Johnson is also the last of five Downing Street occupants that Merkel will have dealt with over 16 years in office. A successor will be identified in elections on Sunday. When it comes to getting the measure of successive prime ministers, only Queen Elizabeth II beats the current German chancellor for depth of experience.
By the length of her reign, Merkel has acquired something like regal status not just in Germany but across Europe. She has been an anchor of continuity in an age of extraordinary volatility. She has helped navigate the EU through cascading crises, usually with tactical patches that defer hard strategic choices. The merits of that technique, and whether it can continue without Merkel’s personal authority, are disputed on the continent.
But in Britain Merkel represents something different, based on a more selective reading of the record. She is an icon for remain-voting liberals, who have experienced the past few years as something more traumatic than normal electoral defeat: more like exile.
That feeling derives in part from the fundamentalist dynamics of Brexit. The leavers denied it at first, but there was no way to accomplish their ambitions without banishing pro-Europeans and burning the things they held sacred. It was a domestic cultural revolution in which definitions of “Europe” were not always connected to international realities, or the actual EU. That was especially true of the paranoid hallucination of Brussels as a colonising oppressor. In reaction, many remainers fell into romantic embrace of the European project’s founding ideal – integration as insurance against war and the antidote to nationalism. That principled pro-European narrative informed Ted Heath’s determination to sign Britain up, but did not feature much in political debate thereafter.
Merkel makes a handy figurehead for that conception of Europe. She exudes rationality and pragmatism, which casts her as a natural opposite to demagoguery and populism. In 2015, she gambled on hospitality to Syrian refugees. In 2016, she greeted Donald Trump’s election victory with a barely coded rebuke, offering cooperation on the basis of shared values: “democracy, freedom and respect for the law and human dignity independent of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views”. He repaid her with venom. She has been the world’s most powerful woman on a global stage groaning under the weight of swaggering men. She was the grownup in the room when Britain and the US looked like twins having a transatlantic tantrum.
Being German added a neat historical irony to Merkel’s standing as Europe’s anti-Trump. It looked like a parable of atonement and vigilance in the country that had salvaged democracy from the ashes of Nazism, rebuking complacency and incipient fascism in the self-styled bastion of the free world.
Things are never quite that simple. Merkel is a Christian conservative, not a humanist liberal. She is wary of multiculturalism, and pragmatic with authoritarians when intra-EU alliances or security of energy supplies require it. She has been patient to the point of indulgence with Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin. Such nuances of realpolitik are less of a concern for British remainers, who have too few heroes to be picky.
The problem – our problem, I should say, as a grieving Europhile – is that the Europe we miss is an expression of things we have lost in Britain, not a place to which we can return. The EU’s strategic interest now lies in making Brexit work according to the letter of the deal that has been done. It is a path of strategic divergence punctuated, for as long as Johnson is prime minister, by provocations that will sustain the myth of Brussels as the enemy of self-determination. Labour will corroborate that story with silence. The rest of Europe will work around its nuisance neighbour. That task involves a tricky balance between contradictory goals: cultivating healthy relations with a rich and powerful player in the region, while refusing concessions that might make Brexit look in any way like a plan that worked.
The rupture was painful, and the wound is open and raw for many British remainers. But the continental site of the injury is covered in scar tissue. That does not have to mean there is no reconciliation available, only that it feels remote right now. The unpredictability of recent years is a warning against confident long-term forecasts. Merkel was one of the few constants, which is why her exit feels so poignant; a sunset in the rear-view mirror.
For Germany, a new chancellor will bring new policies. For the EU it will be a test of cohesion. Those are measurable challenges. For remainers, the loss has a more abstract, nostalgic inflection. Merkel has been our ambassador from the time when there was no Brexit; when there was a place for Britain in a wider European project. That place is now kept open only in the remainer imagination, where Merkel stands on a pedestal, not for veneration as a leader, but as a monument to the leadership that pro-European Britain never had.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2021/sep/21/refugee-crisis-two-myths-angela-merkel;2021-09-21;How the refugee crisis created two myths of Angela Merkel;"The right says the German chancellor undermined EU security; Liberals say it was a triumph. But her legacy is far more mixed
When Angela Merkel steps down as chancellor once Germany’s elections later this month produce a new government, the tributes will centre on her role as the figurehead of western liberalism; an island of stability, caution and openness in an era marked by turbulence and far-right reaction. She will be remembered “for serious work, stable leadership and having a gift for political compromise”, wrote Ishaan Tharoor in the Washington Post last week. When she faced off against Donald Trump after his inauguration in 2017, some newspapers dubbed her the new “leader of the free world”.
Fundamental to this image is the intervention she made in late summer 2015, at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis. “Wir schaffen das” – we’ll manage this – was Merkel’s public statement as thousands of people, mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, were making their way through Turkey, Greece and the Balkans to western Europe. By declaring Germany – and, by extension, Europe – open to refugees, she was making a bold, pragmatic statement of intent.
Yet two contradictory myths have grown up around the “wir schaffen das” moment, both of which overstate the significance of her intervention and mischaracterise its effects. The populist right blames Merkel for prompting one of the largest mass migrations in the continent’s recent history, a “catastrophic mistake”, as Trump later put it, that would undermine Europe’s security and identity through an overwhelming foreign intrusion.
Liberals, meanwhile, treat it as a triumph. Merkel’s stance, in this telling, held true to the values that supposedly underpin the European project – the EU, after all, is the only geopolitical bloc to have been awarded the Nobel peace prize – and showed that a crisis could be met with compassion.
In truth, Merkel’s contribution to Europe’s politics of immigration went much further than “wir schaffen das”, and her legacy is far more mixed. As an investigation by Die Zeit has since shown, “wir schaffen das” did not, for the most part, encourage migration: it acknowledged a reality that already existed.
The refugee crisis had already been under way for several months by the summer of 2015, with people motivated to travel more by what was pushing them from their homes than the reception they expected in Europe. Syrians in 2015, for instance, were facing a worsening conflict, decreasing food rations from aid agencies, and employment bans in Lebanon and Turkey, where most Syrian refugees have settled. When Germany announced in early September 2015, a few days after Merkel’s speech, that it would keep its borders open to refugees who were heading westwards from the Keleti railway station in Budapest, people had been travelling for months already.
What’s more, Europe’s “crisis” – the chaotic and deadly arrival of people not just through Greece but across the central Mediterranean from Africa – was in large part a product of the continent’s own border policies, which had closed off safe routes to asylum and funnelled people into dangerous bottlenecks. Germany under Merkel, as the EU’s most powerful member, played a key role in creating the problem. It helped maintain a system in which border security was given higher priority than refugee reception – between 2007 and 2013, according to Amnesty International, the EU spent €2bn on the former, and only €700m on the latter. Likewise, Merkel’s insistence on punitive austerity as the solution to Europe’s earlier economic crisis fatally weakened the capacity of frontline states such as Greece to respond to greater numbers of refugees at a crucial moment.
Even the moment of openness that “wir schaffen das” expressed was short-lived, with Germany soon working to rebuild and strengthen Fortress Europe. By mid-September 2015, Germany had introduced temporary controls on its border with Austria, the beginning of a process that would eventually see migration routes through south-eastern Europe closed off. A few months later, Merkel was a leading proponent of the 2016 deal that effectively trapped many refugees in Turkey, while Germany has done nothing to challenge the EU’s authoritarian turn that has made search and rescue in the Mediterranean almost impossible. Merkel may have been a bulwark against far-right domination of European politics, but the price was to absorb some of the far-right’s agenda on border control.
Yet while Merkel did not radically alter the European course of the crisis, she shifted the tone of debate at a crucial moment. Fleeting as it was, this mattered. Its effects can be seen in the way German society accommodated the 1.7 million people who claimed asylum there between 2015 and 2019. Despite the dire predictions from the right, this has been an undoubted success: a survey published last year suggested that refugees who arrived in Germany between 2013 and 2016 were finding jobs more rapidly than in previous years. As the Guardian reported last year, another survey suggested that more than 80% of refugee children felt that they belonged in Germany and were welcome. The xenophobic backlash, playing on fears of crime or terrorism, is real, but it is something that can be – and is being – challenged.
Britain’s government makes an instructive comparison: even as it proclaims its generosity towards a small fraction of the people currently trying to flee Afghanistan (the official scheme promises to resettle 20,000 people over five years), this is drowned out by its authoritarian posturing. The latest of these, a promise to “turn around” migrant boats in the Channel, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, risks deadly consequences if it ever comes to pass. The response to recent Afghan arrivals – sustained by a huge volunteer effort – itself reveals the shoddiness of Britain’s asylum system: why is it being left to volunteers and charities to provide essentials such as clothes?
Ultimately, Merkel’s legacy tells us less about one politician’s actions than about what can be done if a society has the will to help people in need. That is a collective effort. But the myths and symbols politicians trade in have the capacity to enable such efforts, or to destroy them. In Britain, it often feels like the debate on asylum is dominated by a competition to see who can sound the toughest: between politicians who enthusiastically push a hard-right agenda, and those who purport to be liberals but take a tough stance because they think it’s what the public wants.
This goes beyond the peculiar cruelties of our current government: it is the product of years of xenophobia encouraged by the rightwing press, and will take a huge effort to unpick. But Merkel should remind us, however inconsistent her actions might have been in reality, that there is always an alternative.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/19/centre-left-german-election-candidate-eager-to-form-government-with-greens;2021-09-19;Germany: centre-left candidate ‘eager to govern with Greens’;"Poll declares Olaf Scholz of the SPD victor of all three televised debates before next Sunday’s vote
The centre-left frontrunner to replace Angela Merkel emphasised his eagerness to form a government with the Greens in the last TV debate before next Sunday’s German elections, as the ecological party’s candidate came close to ruling out joining a coalition with the outgoing chancellor’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
A snap poll declared Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to have emerged victorious from three out of three televised debates, with more respondents describing him as the winner of Sunday night’s showdown than the CDU’s Armin Laschet or the Green party’s Annalena Baerbock.
On the programme – hosted by private broadcasters ProSieben, Sat.1 and Kabeleins – moderators allowed the three candidates to explain their position at a slower and more in-depth pace than at previous encounters.
The first half-hour alone was taken up by a discussion of social policy that brought out commonalties between the SPD and the Greens.
Both Scholz and Baerbock call for raising the minimum wage to €12 (£10.25) an hour, and propose taxing high earners more strongly to provide tax relief for those on low incomes.
When the Green candidate said she wants to introduce a basic security benefit for children, financed out of taxes on couples with income of more than €200,000, her Social Democrat rival agreed with her.
The two politicians kept a more cordial tone between each other throughout, and in his concluding statement Scholz said it was his belief that “most voters” wanted the next German government to be made up of his party and the Greens.
Baerbock, meanwhile, expressed her lack of enthusiasm for a so-called “Jamaica coalition” with the CDU and the pro-business, low-tax Free Democratic party (FDP), without categorically ruling out joining such a power-sharing arrangement.
“I’ve made it clear that I think it’s time for the [Christian Democratic] Union to go into opposition,” she said.
The lopsided dynamic initially seemed to suit CDU leader Laschet, who has on the campaign trail often cut the least fortunate figure when at his most combative.
The slower pace of the debate allowed the Rhinelander to emphasise fundamental differences between his party’s worldview and those of his centre-left rivals: politics should not interfere with unions and employers negotiating appropriate wages for each sector, nor should it try to dictate to industry which technologies to invest in for the future.
Laschet accused the Green party of wanting to restrain technological innovation by burdening industry with bans on specific products. Baerbock responded by pointing out that Laschet’s own party had in the 1990s banned the use of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) in refrigerators. As a result, she said, “the best fridges” were now being built in Germany.
As in the previous two debates, Social Democrat candidate Scholz took a step back while his two rivals tore into each other. Snap polls suggest his strategy worked: in a poll conducted at the end of the programme, 42% of respondents described him as the winner, ahead of Laschet on 27% and Baerbock on 25%."
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-angela-merkel-farewell-to-a-bulwark-of-stability#comments;2021-09-19;The Guardian view on Angela Merkel: farewell to a bulwark of stability;"Though sometimes overly cautious, the German chancellor has been a standard bearer for a consensual way of doing politics
One of the most emblematic political photographs of recent times was taken during a G7 summit in Canada in 2018. Leaning forward across a narrow table with hands outstretched, a grim-faced Angela Merkel confronts Donald Trump, who sits with his arms folded, refusing to meet her eye. Emmanuel Macron and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, flank the German chancellor as she glowers down at the American president.
As Ms Merkel prepares to stand down as chancellor following next Sunday’s German election, after 16 years, the image sums up her recent role as a bulwark of liberal values in turbulent times. Amid resurgent nationalism and deep political polarisation across the west, the longest-serving and most influential European leader of the 21st century has been a vital standard bearer for a consensual, rules-based way of doing politics on the world stage. The political virtues she has embodied during her long reign – patience, tolerance, a lack of stridency and an aversion to showmanship – have come into their own, as culture wars proliferate on all sides. Her famous decision to keep Germany’s borders open to Syrian refugees in 2015 demonstrated a generosity of spirit and compassion to which all western democracies should aspire.
But beyond the upheavals of recent years, the overall legacy of Germany’s first female chancellor is more complex and enigmatic. Domestically, Merkelism became synonymous with an ecumenical and managerial politics of the centre ground. The global financial crash tempered Ms Merkel’s neoliberal economic instincts, and during 12 of her 16 years as chancellor she led a Christian Democrat-Social Democrat “grand coalition”. This hobbled her centre-left opponents’ attempts to present themselves as a distinct alternative and allowed her to reap the political rewards of successful policies such as a new minimum wage – which was an SPD condition for entering into coalition in 2013. Though Ms Merkel’s political convictions were difficult to pin down, a certain ambiguity, flexibility and calculated blandness became the secret of her success. Four victorious federal elections testified to the efficacy of an inherently cautious approach. But latterly her writ has not run in the poorer east, where the rightwing nationalists of the AfD have enjoyed significant success amid growing disillusionment.
The deliberately low-key style worked for many of the crises that came Ms Merkel’s way. But some challenges could have benefited from greater imagination and strategic ambition. In Europe, her consensus-building skills mostly have been an enormous asset, especially in ensuring fiscal solidarity between European Union member states during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the punitive austerity forced upon southern European states during the European debt crisis in the early 2010s – insisted upon by Ms Merkel and her then finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble – was deeply misguided and anti-democratic, and failed to address real flaws in the economic architecture of the eurozone. The backlash helped launch an era of political turbulence and populist insurgencies, and brought nationalism back into fashion.
More recently, Ms Merkel’s Green party opponents have been right to criticise the slow timetable for ending the country’s dependence on coal, and the lack of financial firepower to enable a fair green transition. In relation to China, whose appetite for German exports underpinned her economic model, she has pursued a policy of profitable accommodation that appears out of step with changing geopolitical times.
Nevertheless, Ms Merkel’s status as one of the most formidable, skilful and assured political leaders of modern times is beyond question. In the 21st century, no other leader comes close. From when she was working as a quantum physicist in the former East Germany, she has been an avid reader of history. During the course of a length of tenure bettered only by Otto von Bismarck and by her late mentor Helmut Kohl (whom she may yet overtake), she perhaps had a chance to shape her own times more than she did.

One of the most emblematic political photographs of recent times was taken during a G7 summit in Canada in 2018. Leaning forward across a narrow table with hands outstretched, a grim-faced Angela Merkel confronts Donald Trump, who sits with his arms folded, refusing to meet her eye. Emmanuel Macron and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, flank the German chancellor as she glowers down at the American president.
As Ms Merkel prepares to stand down as chancellor following next Sunday’s German election, after 16 years, the image sums up her recent role as a bulwark of liberal values in turbulent times. Amid resurgent nationalism and deep political polarisation across the west, the longest-serving and most influential European leader of the 21st century has been a vital standard bearer for a consensual, rules-based way of doing politics on the world stage. The political virtues she has embodied during her long reign – patience, tolerance, a lack of stridency and an aversion to showmanship – have come into their own, as culture wars proliferate on all sides. Her famous decision to keep Germany’s borders open to Syrian refugees in 2015 demonstrated a generosity of spirit and compassion to which all western democracies should aspire.
But beyond the upheavals of recent years, the overall legacy of Germany’s first female chancellor is more complex and enigmatic. Domestically, Merkelism became synonymous with an ecumenical and managerial politics of the centre ground. The global financial crash tempered Ms Merkel’s neoliberal economic instincts, and during 12 of her 16 years as chancellor she led a Christian Democrat-Social Democrat “grand coalition”. This hobbled her centre-left opponents’ attempts to present themselves as a distinct alternative and allowed her to reap the political rewards of successful policies such as a new minimum wage – which was an SPD condition for entering into coalition in 2013. Though Ms Merkel’s political convictions were difficult to pin down, a certain ambiguity, flexibility and calculated blandness became the secret of her success. Four victorious federal elections testified to the efficacy of an inherently cautious approach. But latterly her writ has not run in the poorer east, where the rightwing nationalists of the AfD have enjoyed significant success amid growing disillusionment.
The deliberately low-key style worked for many of the crises that came Ms Merkel’s way. But some challenges could have benefited from greater imagination and strategic ambition. In Europe, her consensus-building skills mostly have been an enormous asset, especially in ensuring fiscal solidarity between European Union member states during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the punitive austerity forced upon southern European states during the European debt crisis in the early 2010s – insisted upon by Ms Merkel and her then finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble – was deeply misguided and anti-democratic, and failed to address real flaws in the economic architecture of the eurozone. The backlash helped launch an era of political turbulence and populist insurgencies, and brought nationalism back into fashion.
More recently, Ms Merkel’s Green party opponents have been right to criticise the slow timetable for ending the country’s dependence on coal, and the lack of financial firepower to enable a fair green transition. In relation to China, whose appetite for German exports underpinned her economic model, she has pursued a policy of profitable accommodation that appears out of step with changing geopolitical times.
Nevertheless, Ms Merkel’s status as one of the most formidable, skilful and assured political leaders of modern times is beyond question. In the 21st century, no other leader comes close. From when she was working as a quantum physicist in the former East Germany, she has been an avid reader of history. During the course of a length of tenure bettered only by Otto von Bismarck and by her late mentor Helmut Kohl (whom she may yet overtake), she perhaps had a chance to shape her own times more than she did. But her reassuringly stable and constructive presence in the politics of the west will be badly missed.

As Annalena Baerbock steps on to the stage, the downpour that minutes before had soaked those gathered on Chemnitz’s Theater Platz ceases. The Green party candidate is quick to use the opportunity to stress that everything is still possible. “Minutes ago it was raining, now the sun has come out – it can happen,” she says with a huge grin, hinting that the change in the weather is a good omen for her party’s fortunes.
There are both chuckles and jeers from those gathered. With a week to go before one of the most open and tension-filled German elections in years, Baerbock is in the last stages of a campaign that weeks ago saw her heading for the top job, as successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, but in which she is now fighting for second or third place.
With Germany on the brink of its biggest political switch since 2005, the drama of the final days of campaigning is pulling in the crowds. And everyone puts the twist on the weather that suits them. For Brigitte Jung, a retired kitchen help who has been unemployed since being made redundant from the Chemnitzer Hof hotel on the same square just over 20 years ago, the rain is “a sign from him up there that she and her kind are not wanted”.
The 73-year-old, sheltering under a lilac umbrella, insists that the environmentalist party would be a disaster for Chemnitz, the state of Saxony, and for Germany. “They’ll put up the price of petrol, cover the country with wind farms and ban meat,” she warns.
And in reference to two forms of transport the Greens have been promoting to cut CO2 emissions, she adds: “I’m too old to ride a cargo bike and too poor to own an electric car.”
Neither is she enthusiastic about the other main contenders for the chancellorship. Armin Laschet for the Christian Democrats “is nothing but a creepy clown,” she says, recalling how he was caught laughing on camera at a tribute to those who died in Germany’s recent floods. Olaf Scholz for the Social Democrats, who is leading in the polls, she finds “colourless but probably the best of a bad bunch”.
Last time, she voted for the far-right AfD – along with a quarter of Chemnitzers – but she says they “will never get into government, so what’s the point of giving them my vote?” Despite her disillusionment, she is keen to “see the circus”, as she puts it, on display on Friday morning in this university city, known as Karl Marx Stadt in communist times, which has a strong working-class industrial heritage.
Among the crowds a group of anti-vaccine protesters and pandemic sceptics try to interrupt the event, shouting “you will not force the vaccine poison on us” and blowing whistles.
Overlooking the square, some dark-clad, burly males, identifying themselves as members of the far-right scene, wave banners and jeer as a contingent of several dozen police look on. Memories of 2018 still shape the local psyche: tensions over immigration to Germany spilled into street riots here, led by rightwing extremists, after the death of a local man for which two refugees were blamed.
In one of her few election tour dates in the former communist east, Baerbock, dressed in a black trench coat, is at pains to acknowledge the struggles of those who participated in the peaceful revolution to bring down the East German regime in 1989. And she says similar efforts are needed now to tackle the “huge challenge of our age,” namely the climate emergency. She predicts that Europe’s largest economy has the innovation and creative potential to become a pioneer in climate-neutral technology, which she insists will “create well-paid jobs”, even as it closes down local coal mines.
In Saxony, the Greens will be lucky if they secure fifth place ahead of the far-left Die Linke. But they are predicted to secure 10% – almost double their vote in 2017, which, say policy makers within the party, makes Baerbock’s presence in Chemnitz worthwhile, not just for this election, but those to come.
Another reason is the AfD, which despite being predicted to lose votes this time round, still breathes down the necks of all the established parties in Saxony, as elsewhere in the region, in particular since entering the Bundestag as the main opposition party four years ago.
The AfD rejects what it views as the hysteria surrounding climate change, which it says, as with the coronavirus, is little more than an artificial construct being used to impose controls on the population like those deployed by the communist regime.
“Climate change is nothing new,” says Tino Chrupalla, whose election to the Bundestag for the AfD in the Saxon city of Görlitz has propelled him to the top echelons of the party in Berlin. “It makes little sense to tackle global warming – we just need to adjust to it.” The tax on CO2 emissions is nothing more than a “modern form of the selling of indulgences”, he insists, as well as warning that Germans are being fleeced by “the highest electricity prices in the world” as it attempts to transition to renewable energy. Instead of wind and solar energy, the party is determined to resurrect nuclear power stations.
On Friday evening, just over 260km to the north in Potsdam, a posher part of the former communist east, young people are gathered on Bassinplatz to put questions to the SPD’s Olaf Scholz, who has been on a roll for weeks after surpassing the CDU’s Laschet in the polls.
Alexa Bouwer, 22, a history student drinking a beer with friends, says she has already made up her mind who she will vote for but she has come to soak up the atmosphere.
“I have only ever known Angela Merkel,” she says, pointing out that she was aged six when the outgoing German chancellor came to power. “This election is one of the most crucial for years, not just for Germany but also for Europe. It’s about our future, and we are excited about having the chance to shape a new political landscape.”
For the two-hour debate, Scholz is dressed casually in a sweater, and – unusually – is addressed as Olaf, and referred to in the personal “du” form. He promises that as chancellor he will tackle everything from increasing pay and working conditions for care workers to ensuring farmers aren’t priced off their land by renewable energy plants.
He will also “get to work immediately” on ensuring that Germany becomes greenhouse gas neutral by 2045, but insists “the enormity of the task involved in effectively dismantling an industrial system which has existed for over 200 years is something most people do not grasp”.
The atmosphere is cosy and amicable, the seriousness of the topics lightened somewhat by jokes and beer. But then a group calling itself “the Last Generation” arrives. Members have been on hunger strike for 20 days, and today they bring a banner and a demand for a live television debate on the climate emergency with Scholz and the other leading candidates ahead of election day.
Alarm has been growing over the health of the strikers, who are camped in front of the Reichstag in Berlin, and in hushed tones on the sidelines Scholz urges them to “stop this self-destructive act”, saying he is willing to speak to them but only when they break their strike.
“I’m so disappointed,” says Jacob Heinze, one of the hunger strikers, gaunt and wrapped in a scarf as he watches Scholz drive away and the audience disperse. “I have no hope for this election as none of the parties which have a chance of winning has a programme which could avert the crisis that’s coming, and none of them are prepared to have an honest conversation about it.”"

On 26 September, Germany will vote for the 20th parliament of the postwar era, after which Angela Merkel will stand down as chancellor after 16 years.
Voting booths in the country’s 299 electoral districts will open at 8am and close at 6pm. Holders of a German passport who have lived in the country for at least three months are eligible to vote – German citizens living abroad can apply to participate in the election remotely and are allowed to vote under certain conditions.
Due to the pandemic, more people are expected to cast their vote by letter than ever before. At Germany’s last federal elections in 2017, 28.6% of votes were postal votes – this year, as many as 50% of eligible voters in some regions have already applied for a postal vote, though by mid-September fewer had been posted than in previous years.
As soon as voting booths close at 6pm, broadcasters will publish an exit poll, followed by projected outcomes based on public counts in representative voting districts.
There will be 47 parties listed on the ballot sheet, which enables each voter to cast two votes: one for a candidate standing in their constituency, and one for a party list of candidates in their federal state.
A 5% threshold limits the number of parties who can send a delegate into the Bundestag after the vote. Six parties are expected to clear the hurdle: the two traditional Volksparteien who have governed in a “grand coalition” for the last eight years, namely the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Green party, the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP), the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and the leftwing Die Linke, which has been polling precipitously close to the 5% hurdle.
One politician who won’t be standing for election is the outgoing chancellor, for the first time in German history: Merkel won’t be in the running to represent the Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I constituency, which she has held continuously since it was created after reunification in 1990.
Three parties have nominated official candidates to replace her, though their names won’t be signalled as such on ballot papers: the CDU has put forward its party leader, Armin Laschet, the SPD the current finance minister and deputy chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the Greens its co-leader Annalena Baerbock.
With the outgoing government having committed Germany to become greenhouse gas neutral by 2045, one of the dominant questions has been how Europe’s largest economy will go about curbing the carbon emissions of its industry.
The Greens and Die Linke want to meet the same target earlier, partly by phasing out coal power stations by the year 2030, eight years earlier than currently planned. The FDP wants to reach climate neutrality by 2050, while the AfD rejects the scientific consensus on man-made climate change and has not put forward a climate policy.
Whether environmental targets will have an impact on day-to-day behaviour has been one of the flashpoints of the campaign. While the CDU and FDP place an emphasis on emissions trading, SPD, Greens and Die Linke want to introduce speed limits on German motorways and make short-distance flights unattractive or even illegal.
The economic consequences of the pandemic are another dominant theme. Even though Germany has taken on large amounts of debt to shoulder the effect of two prolonged lockdowns, CDU and the FDP reject future tax rises, with the later promising far-reaching cuts. The SPD and the Greens, on the other hand, say they want to offer tax relief to small businesses but also re-introduce a wealth tax of about 1% for high earners.
Some issues have been notable by their absence. While all the large parties apart from the AfD express their commitment to the European project, their manifestos in this respect have been short on specifics.
This election race has been one of the most open in recent memory, with three parties having at various stages taken leads in opinion polls. After the CDU and the Greens unveiled their candidates in the spring, the ecological party briefly leapfrogged the conservatives into the top spot. When Baerbock’s star faded, following allegations she had plagiarised passages in a book and inflated her CV, the CDU reestablished the pole position it had enjoyed for the first year of the pandemic. But the CDU candidate Laschet has looked gaffe-prone and weak within his own party, and in recent weeks the SPD has crept ahead to become the new surprise frontrunner.
Crucially, none of the parties are forecast to win more than 25-27% of the vote at most, meaning the winning party on the night won’t automatically field the next chancellor unless it can build a coalition that has a governing majority.
With 6-10% of votes this year predicted to go to parties that don’t make it above the parliamentary threshold, that majority may need as little as 46% of the vote.
Even then, current polls indicate the next German government will require a power-sharing deal between three different parties, such as a coalition between SPD, Greens and FDP (nicknamed “traffic light coalition” after the parties’ traditional colours) or CDU, Greens and FDP (nicknamed “Jamaica coalition”).
If no single party has an absolute majority, two or more parties enter exploratory talks to determine their willingness to enter a coalition with one another. If a basic desire to cooperate can be established, the parties enter coalition talks to determine which party holds which ministry, culminating in a coalition treaty. While these talks are ongoing, the old government remains in power in a caretaker role, potentially for months: there is no time limit on government formation, though parliament needs to convene for the first time at least 30 days after the vote, to elect the new president. The new chancellor is voted in only after the coalition government has reached an agreement."

After 15 years of “Merkelism” the German chancellor’s neutral, consensus-building approach means many Europeans accept her country as the EU’s leader – but post-Angela Merkel Berlin will have to radically change tack, according to a study.
“Angela Merkel has come to embody a strong and stable Germany, positioning herself as Europe’s anchor though more than a decade of crises,” said Piotr Buras, the co-author of the report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).
“But ‘Merkelism’ is no longer sustainable. Merkel may have adroitly managed the status quo across the continent, but the challenges that Europe faces now – the pandemic, climate change, geopolitical competition – require radical solutions, not cosmetic changes. The EU needs a visionary Germany.”
The study, based on polling in 12 EU member states, found “strong and continued” support for German leadership within the bloc and enduring approval for the chancellor, who steps down this month ahead of federal elections.
A large plurality (41%) of respondents, including majorities in the Netherlands (58%), Spain (57%) and Portugal (52%) said they would favour Merkel over France’s Emmanuel Macron in a hypothetical contest for EU president.
Pluralities across the 12 countries also said they trusted Germany to defend their interests across a range of issues, including – despite criticism of Germany’s hard line on austerity and balanced budgets – economic and financial policy (36%).
Even countries with very different policies, such as Spain (45%) and non-eurozone Hungary (50%), backed German economic leadership, while even the low 24% recorded in Italy was the strongest answer among those who expressed an opinion.
Similarly, 35% of Europeans surveyed said they would be happy to see Berlin take the lead for the EU on defending human rights, including 49% of respondents in Hungary and 23% in Poland, both of which are involved in rule-of-law disputes with the bloc.
A plurality of Europeans polled for the study also believed that without Merkel there would have been more conflict in the world rather than less, a view held most strongly in Spain (33%), the Netherlands (30%) and Portugal (28%).
Support for Berlin as a potential geopolitical leader, however, was markedly low. Only 25% of respondents felt Germany should handle the EU’s relationship with the US, for example, with support for Berlin taking the lead in the bloc’s dealings with Russia (20%) and China (17%) even lower.
The report revealed a disconnect between the way Europeans see Germany and the way Germany sees itself, with German respondents yet to be persuaded that their country could or should play a greater role within the EU.
Only on the question of standing up for human rights and democracy did more than one-third (38%) of Germans say their country could defend EU interests, with one in five saying it would be unable to lead on any of the issues addressed in the survey.
Germans were also pessimistic about their country’s post-Merkel future, with a majority (52%) believing its “golden age” was past – a view shared by a sizeable minority (34%) in the 12 countries surveyed. Only 10% believed it was still to come.
The authors said the survey showed that to maintain the reputation and trust it has built up under Merkel’s leadership, Germany must radically rethink its EU policies, going beyond Merkelism to confront member states such as Poland and Hungary that are accused of violating the bloc’s values.
Beyond Europe’s borders, Germany must also change its broader foreign policy, they argued, finding a way to use its economic and political clout to defend Europe’s interests and principles by, for example, working closely with Joe Biden’s administration on a transatlantic approach to China.
The survey showed, however, that German domestic opinion would be an obstacle. “The key challenge, for whoever wins next week’s election, will be to convince Germans that a serious shift is required in how their country engages with the EU,” said the co-author Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the ECFR.
“The approach of putting EU cohesion above all else, which has shaped much of the EU’s policy agenda during the Merkel era, could prove a tempting pathway for Merkel’s successor. But in the face of international crises and domestic concerns about Germany’s role within the EU, ‘more of the same’ is unlikely to hold.”
For Germany to retain its status as the leading driver of EU policy, Puglierin said, it would need to “engage with the issues that are important to its citizens, and provide its EU partners with clearcut ideas about how the EU can compete in a divided and crisis-shaken world”.
Merkel’s successors would also need to “sell the importance of German leadership in the bloc to their voters at home”, she said. “They can no longer afford to remain neutral, or pursue the status quo. It is time for Berlin to take sides.”"

Candidates representing the two parties that have governed Germany in a “grand coalition” for 12 out of the past 16 years tore into each other’s record on Sunday night, in a televised election debate that saw centre-left frontrunner Olaf Scholz declared winner despite swipes from his conservative rival.
In the second of three televised debates, hosted by Germany’s two public broadcasters, conservative candidate Armin Laschet of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) tried to turn his fortunes around by attacking finance minister Scholz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) over his track-record on tackling money laundering and corruption.
Ahead of national elections in two weeks’ time, polls predict Laschet’s CDU crashing to historic lows as the tenure of its four-term chancellor, Angela Merkel, comes to an end.
“If my finance minister were to work like you, then we would have a serious problem,” said Laschet, who is the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia.
Germany’s federal finance and justice ministry were raided last week in order to obtain information relevant to an investigation into the government’s anti money-laundering agency, though not to probe Scholz’s ministry itself.
Scholz accused his CDU rival of being “dishonest” for suggesting he himself stood accused of wrongdoing, and boasted of his own effort to modernise the ministry he has led for three years.
Similar attempts to damage Scholz over his links to the Wirecard accounting scandal and the Cum-Ex tax fraud scheme failed to achieve the desired effect.
Laschet’s line of attack was softened by the fact that financial scandals tend to be too complicated to be summarised in TV soundbites, and that questions about failed oversight duties could equally be asked about his own party.
A snap poll published after the debate showed Scholz repeat the clear victory he had achieved in the first debate, with 41% of viewers describing the SPD candidate as the most convincing, compared with 27% who said the same of Laschet and 25% who opted for Green party candidate Annalena Baerbock.
Baerbock cut a more relaxed and lively figure than in the first debate but found herself pushed into a moderator role as the two men got stuck in what she mocked as Vergangenheitsbewältigungen, raking over the past of their coalition wrangles.
The Green candidate criticised the largest two parties for their unambitious carbon emissions targets, arguing that Germany needed to switch off its coal power plants significantly earlier than 2038, as planned.
She declined to rule out holding coalition talks between the SPD, the Greens and far-left outfit Die Linke. She said Die Linke was “of course a democratic party” that did not represent as extreme positions as the far-right Alternative für Deutschland on the other end of the political spectrum.
Scholz too declined to rule out coalition talks with Die Linke but accentuated his difference to the party founded in 2007 partly by disaffected Social Democrats. “An acknowledgement of transatlantic relations, Nato and the European Union are necessary for a good government,” he said.
Laschet, in turn, did not rule out the possibility that his party could continue to serve in a coalition with the SPD, but with senior and junior roles reversed in the case of a Scholz victory."
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/12/europes-fear-of-refugee-has-shattered-the-illusion-of-a-cosmopolitan-haven;2021-09-12;Europe’s reputation as a cosmopolitan haven has been exposed as a mirage;"NA
When Kabul fell in mid-August, almost the first reaction of European leaders was fear of another wave of refugees arriving on the continent. “We must anticipate and protect ourselves against major irregular migratory flows,” said the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Armin Laschet, the Christian Democrat candidate hoping to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor in the election that takes place in two weeks, said there could be no repeat of the refugee crisis of 2015, when Germany received more than a million asylum seekers. By the end of the month, the European Council had agreed to “act jointly to prevent the recurrence of uncontrolled large-scale illegal migration movements faced in the past”.
The focus on “protecting” Europe from an influx of asylum seekers reflects a troubling transformation of the European Union over the past decade. There was a time when “pro-Europeans” were confident that the world would almost inevitably be remade in the image of the EU, as it endlessly expanded its rules and exported its model centred on the “social market economy” and the welfare state. Since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2010, however, Europeans have become more defensive and now see the world largely in terms of threats.
Against this background, Europe also increasingly conceives of itself in cultural terms. As the European model has become less credible and compelling – in part because, led by Merkel, Europeans have hollowed it out in an attempt to become more “competitive” – “pro-Europeans” now talk endlessly of “European values”. Ursula von der Leyen’s “geopolitical” European Commission even includes a commissioner for promoting the European way of life (it was originally “protecting” rather than “promoting”), who is responsible for asylum and immigration issues.
When Macron became French president in 2017, he spoke of a Europe qui protège – “that protects”. This was initially, above all, about protecting citizens from the market; he hoped to reform the eurozone to create a more redistributive EU. But his plans were blocked, or rather simply ignored, by Merkel. Since then, under pressure from the far right and increasingly mimicking it, Macron has reinvented the idea of cultural, rather than economic, protection – in particular, from Muslims.
“Pro-European” centrists such as Macron increasingly think of international politics in terms of a Huntingtonian “clash of civilisations” – but whereas Samuel Huntington saw the west as one civilisation that would find itself in conflict with China and Islam in the post-cold war period, they see Europe as a civilisation that is distinct from, and which must also assert itself against, the United States.
The civilisational turn in the European project complicates the story of Brexit we have told ourselves. Leavers have often been portrayed as yearning for a white Britain before mass immigration began in the 1950s. But the reality is more complex. For example, one-third of Britain’s black and Asian population voted to leave in 2016. As political scientist Neema Begum has shown, many did so because they saw the EU as a “white fortress” – and even those who voted to remain tended not to identify as European. Continental Europe generally lags behind the UK in terms of racial equality – for example, Brexit dramatically reduced the number of MEPs from ethnic minorities in the European parliament. (There are no exact figures because member states such as France and Germany do not collect ethnic data.)
On the continent, “pro-Europeans” believe they have something in common with other Europeans that separates them from the rest of the world – they think of Europe as what the Germans call a Schicksalsgemeinschaft, or community of fate. Few remainers think in this way; many are genuine cosmopolitans. The problem is that they are often as ignorant of the reality of the EU as leavers are and support an imaginary EU rather than the real existing EU. In particular, many on the British left imagine the EU to be much more open and progressive than it really is. Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator and now a candidate for the Republican nomination in the French presidential election next year, last week called for a suspension of immigration from outside Europe.
It is particularly odd, when you think about it, that identifying with “Europe” should be thought of as an expression of cosmopolitanism. Europe is not the world and supporting the EU, or thinking of yourself as European, does not make you a “citizen of the world”, let alone a “citizen of nowhere”, as Theresa May famously suggested in 2016. Rather, it makes you a citizen of a particular region – one that happens to be the whitest on earth. In fact, historically, “European” and “white” were largely synonymous – think, for example, of what “European” meant in apartheid South Africa.
It is true that, after the Second World War, a new, more civic European identity emerged, at least among elites, that was centred on what became the EU. But it constantly drew on older ethnic or cultural ideas of Europe for legitimacy and pathos – for example, the most prestigious prize for “pro-Europeans” is awarded in the name of Charlemagne, the embodiment of a medieval European identity synonymous with Christianity. As even the term “pro-European” illustrates, civic, ethnic or cultural ideas of European identity were always being elided.
Moreover, while the EU was based on learning the lessons of centuries of conflict within Europe that culminated in the Second World War, and gradually also came to incorporate the collective memory of the Holocaust into its narrative, “pro-Europeans” did not even attempt to learn the lessons of what Europeans had done to the rest of the world and never had anything to say about the history of colonialism.
The EU has become more embattled during the past decade as the far right surges throughout the continent and increasingly sets the agenda for the centre right and even some centre-left parties, such as the Danish Social Democrats. This means that the fragile civic identity that emerged during the postwar period seems to be giving way to a more cultural or even ethnic identity – defined, in particular, against Islam. In other words, whiteness may actually be becoming more, not less, central to the European project.

The new frontrunner to win Germany’s national vote at the end of this month says he believes he can reawaken Europe’s centre-left from its decade-long slumber with a two-fold promise: to guarantee his country’s continued economic success, while at the same time putting an end to the myth that individual success is always self-made.
Germany’s vice-chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has this summer surprisingly lifted his Social Democratic party (SPD) above Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in opinion polls, in large part due to a reputation for rational decision-making and fiscal prudence that mirrors that of the outgoing chancellor.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Scholz said he would also use the political victory within his reach to kickstart a fresh debate about how to redefine professional and social merit.
“Why did Britain vote for Brexit if it was against its own interest? Why did America vote for Trump? I believe it is because people are experiencing deep social insecurities, and lack appreciation for what they do,” the 63-year-old said before a campaign rally in the university city of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony.
“We see the same dissatisfaction and insecurity not just in the US or the UK but in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Austria or Germany – countries that may look from the outside like they don’t have any problems at all.
“Among certain professional classes, there is a meritocratic exuberance that has led people to believe their success is completely self-made. As a result, those who actually keep the show on the road don’t get the respect they deserve. That has to change.”
Centred around the word “respect”, Scholz’s campaign borrows heavily from Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel’s recent writings on the “tyranny of merit”, and he told the Guardian he had been left “shaken” after reading the British sociologist Michael Young’s 1958 book The Rise of Meritocracy.
“He [Young] described the rise of meritocracy as a dystopian satire of the year 2034, but it has turned out to be an almost prophetic description of the trends of our time,” Scholz said.
Thinkers such as Sandel or Daniel Markovits argue that meritocracy – a political system that aims to reward individuals on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement – has come to be dominated by educated knowledge workers who define merit solely along their own value sets and neglect to credit physical forms of labour.
“There is nothing wrong about merit as such,” Scholz said. “But it is something that must not only be limited to top-earners and those with university degrees. A security guard has merit too. Manual labourers don’t deserve less respect than academics.”
For the potential next leader of Europe’s largest economy to adopt this line of argument is significant, but in Scholz’s case also potentially risky: meritocracy was championed unironically by the third way tendency within the European and American left, in which Scholz, as a SPD general secretary during the Gerhard Schröder years, played more than a bit part.
And whether “respect” can become a coherent policy as well as a catchphrase remains unclear. “We have two tasks,” Scholz said. “Recognise these other types of merit on the one hand, and pay better wages for those who are not appropriately compensated on the other. A higher minimum wage is important, as are better wages for carers and skilled workers.”
Some of Scholz’s campaign pledges are social democratic in the old-fashioned sense: as well as the minimum wage increase to €12 an hour, he calls for the return of a wealth tax and the construction of 400,000 new homes a year. The SPD proposes replacing the sanction-tied Hartz IV unemployment benefit controversially introduced by the last centre-left government with a new, less “distrustful” welfare programme, called “citizens’ money”.
“Maybe progressive parties in Europe and the USA have for too long neglected to tackle these two big challenges,” Scholz said. As models for renewing the left, he points not to the Democratic party of the US president, Joe Biden, but social democratic parties in Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
Like its Scandinavian counterparts, even a resurgent SPD is a shadow of its former self: polls show the Social Democrats leading the election race on between 23-25% of the vote. The last time Scholz’s party won a federal election, under Schröder in 2002, it achieved 38% of the vote.
The SPD candidate’s project to reinvigorate the German centre-left remains a balancing act: for while his campaign at least partially reverses out of the rhetoric of the third way, it also seeks to steal the crown of economic competence from the centre-right CDU.
“Germany still has a very powerful industry,” said Scholz. “It is an industry with globally competitive companies, some of which are medium-sized companies with 300 to 2,000 employees. There are very few countries in the world where this tradition is so deeply anchored. We are still good at building cars, planes or satellites.”
When sketching out the task of setting Germany’s ferociously energy-hungry industry on greener tracks, Scholz sounds more similar to his centre-right rival Armin Laschet than Annalena Baerbock of the German Green party.
“Our great challenge is that we remain a car nation that is successful at making electric vehicles instead, that our industry produces chemistry, steel or cement without damaging our climate protection targets, and that we achieve this in barely 25 years.”
Private enterprise was already driving a switch to electric vehicles in the German car industry, he argued – the task that would fall on his future government would be to expand the infrastructure enabling its use. “There will be no shortage of investment capital for this new start. But […] there will need to be a charging station at every petrol stop.”
He insisted the effects of global heating could not merely be mitigated, but that “we can take significant steps to stem climate change”, and that his government would be able to do so without a radical break with Germany’s debt-averse fiscal culture.
“The debt brake is in our constitution, and modifications would need a two-thirds majority in our parliaments. In view of the CDU and FDP’s firm stance on this question, no one should build their political ideas on the possibility that the debt brake will substantially change.”
Helmut Schmidt, Germany’s Social Democrat chancellor from 1974 to 1982, is an evident role model for the SPD candidate: one TV campaign ad starts with the sound of the late fellow Hamburger’s inaugural address laid over images of Scholz striding towards the Bundestag.
Schmidt is often credited with the line that “politicians who have visions should see a doctor”, a quote Scholz said was not only apocryphal but also unfair.
“After all, he is the architect of the G6 and G7: after the collapse of the financial system in his time there was a need to coordinate the economic policies of the largest industrial nations. The same is true today: we should come up with joint response to the current challenges.”
Scholz’s commitment to European sovereignty-sharing is phrased more passionately than Merkel’s, and while the outgoing chancellor was the voice of her party on the question of further economic integration, he points to a potential route for deepening the union of states.
“By the middle of this century, the world will have 10 billion inhabitants. The EU will at this point still only have 400 million. If we want to preserve in the future the things we care about in Europe – democracy, the rule of law, individual freedoms, a market economy, a welfare state – then we have to work together.”
“That is why I believe that progress for the European Union has to be Germany’s most pressing mission right now. Even more so after Great Britain sadly left.”
The recovery package to support member states hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, pushed along by Scholz’s finance ministry in defiance of Germany’s erstwhile frugal union allies, is talked of by German conservatives not as a step towards a “transfer union” but a temporary instrument that will run out in 2027. Scholz, however, claimed it would leave a lasting legacy.
“The EU as a union is taking out joint loans to help states master this crisis. We have agreed that these liabilities will eventually be repaid. This is where the new moment comes in: these debts will not be reimbursed from national contributions based on each member state’s GDP, but from new European own resources. This will make a great difference for Europe’s future development.”"

Germany’s Greens have so far received more large donations ahead of this September’s federal elections than the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel, after a Dutch tech entrepreneur gave the environmental party the highest one-off sum of cash in its history.
Steven Schuurman, co-founder of software company Elastic, whose net worth is listed by Forbes magazine as 2bn US dollars (£1.45bn), on Tuesday transferred to the German Greens (Die Grünen) a donation of 1.25m euros (£1m).
A Greens spokesperson confirmed the receipt of the money and described it as the largest single donation in the party’s history. The party also believes this is the largest one-off donation to any party that has ever been declared to the Bundestag.
The donation is the second large sum given to the Greens this year: in April, the party confirmed it had received 1m euros (£860,000) from a software developer from Greifswald, who told the party he did not feel as if he deserved the riches he had made from speculating on bitcoin.
The party, which nominated co-leader Annalena Baerbock as its candidate for chancellor, is expected to double its showing in parliament compared to the last national vote in 2017, and could play a kingmaker role during the coalition-building phase after the vote.
Schuurman said the donation came with no strings attached and his companies did not stand to profit commercially from Green party policies in Germany.
“I had reached a point where I realised I wanted to use my money and time to make the world a little bit of a better place,” Schuurman said. “The climate crisis is such an immense and international challenge that you can only tackle it through governments.
“Germany is perhaps the most influential country in the EU, and I was impressed with the Greens’ party programme and that they have a candidate who recognises the urgency of the situation.”
“Humanity is a beautiful species,” he added. “This is the generation that will decide whether it will sail into the storm or change direction.”
The Greens’ general secretary, Michael Kellner, said the donation was a “significant sign of support for more climate protection”.
Schuurman’s donation means the party has this year received 3.14m euros (£2.7m) in donations of at least 50,000 euros (£43,000), more than the 2.95m euros (£2.5m) collected by the centre-right CDU, which is fielding party leader Armin Laschet as the candidate to step into Merkel’s shoes and has attracted the highest amount of private donor support at the last two elections.
The pro-business, low-tax Free Democratic party (FDP) is the beneficiary of the highest amount of larger donations, having received 3.6m euros (£3.1m) so far this year.
Schuurman earlier this year donated 1m euros to Dutch social-liberal party D66, and 350,000 euros (£300,000) to the Party for the Animals (PvdD) in the Netherlands.
German political parties are permitted to receive private donations from outside Germany as long as they come from within the EU."

Angela Merkel has used what is likely to be her last speech in the German parliament to make her most impassioned intervention in the electoral race so far, urging the public to vote for her party’s beleaguered candidate over his surging centre-left rival.
The chancellor, who will stand down after federal elections on 26 September, warned of the possibility of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens governing the country in a coalition with the far-left Die Linke.
“What is at stake are real economic and tax-related decisions that will determine the future of our country, the number of jobs,” Merkel said, adding that Armin Laschet of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was the only candidate capable of forming “a moderate government that will lead our country into the future”.
Laschet’s star has sunk dramatically in recent weeks, with one poll published on Tuesday forecasting the CDU to drop below 20% for the first time in Germany’s postwar history. The SPD, fronted in this campaign by the vice-chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, is leading the polls on about 25%.
Merkel also used her speech to criticise Scholz for using the term “guinea pigs” to describe people vaccinated against Covid-19. At a campaign rally on Saturday, the SPD candidate had urged unvaccinated people to get a jab against the virus, saying “guinea pigs” like himself had shown the vaccines were safe.
Merkel said the analogy was “lopsided”: “None of us are guinea pigs, neither Olaf Scholz nor I,” she added in the Bundestag on Tuesday.
Scholz responded that people had to be won over to take the vaccine in a way that was “casual, relaxed, also with jokes that you can laugh about”.
“If some people don’t want to get the joke and kick up a fuss instead, it may have more to do with the fact that the latest opinion polls don’t give them much to laugh about,” Scholz added.
Germany has fully vaccinated 61.4% of its population against Covid, lagging behind other large European nations such as Spain, France and Britain.
Scholz later thanked the chancellor for her work during the pandemic and used the occasion to pitch for his campaign, promising to prioritise the fight against child poverty and push for affordable living and stable pensions.
Merkel, whose governing style has usually involved her rising above the fray of party political squabbles, drew jeers from other parliamentarians for her partisan intervention.
“My goodness, what a fuss!” she retorted. “I’ve been a member of the German Bundestag for more than 30 years and where should we discuss such issues if not here? It is the heart of our democracy.”"

Germany’s ambassador to China, Jan Hecker, has died suddenly at the age of 54, less than two weeks into his Beijing posting.
Hecker was a former foreign policy adviser to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
“We are deeply saddened and shocked to learn of the sudden death of the German ambassador to China,” a statement on the embassy’s website said. “Our hearts are with his family and his friends and colleagues at this time.”
A cause of death has not been given. Hecker began his posting in Beijing on 24 August, having arrived earlier that month with his wife and three children, according to German media. Frank Rückert, Hecker’s deputy, would take over his duties for the time being, Deutsche Welle reported.
Hecker had worked with Merkel’s chancellery since 2015, coordinating refugee policy during the European migrant crisis until he was appointed head of the foreign, security and development policy department in 2017.
“I am profoundly shaken by Jan Hecker’s death,” Merkel said in a statement on Monday. “I mourn for a highly valued, longstanding adviser of deep humanity and outstanding expertise.
“I think with gratitude of our work together and am happy to have been so closely tied to him for years. My deepest sympathy goes out to his wife, his children and his other loved ones in their immeasurable grief.”
Hecker was one of Merkel’s top advisers on foreign policy, and his posting to Beijing was seen in Germany as a concerted effort to stabilise relations with China into the post-Merkel era.
Hecker had been an influential player in Merkel’s exclusive inner circle since 2015, when she tasked him with coordinating the country’s response to the refugee crisis. It was largely due to his competence as an organiser that Germany is now seen as having largely lived up to the chancellor’s promise of Wir schaffen das (“We will manage”).
In recent years, he was in charge of such sensitive diplomatic missions as the Franco-German-led negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. When the US president, Joe Biden, and Chancellor Merkel met for their first in-person bilateral talk at the Cornwall G7 summit this June, photos showed Hecker as one of the only other people at the table.
He had not risen into a position of such power through the conventional diplomatic route but with a background in law: between 2011 and 2015 Hecker was a judge at Germany’s federal administrative court."

Advancing Panzer tanks and Wehrmacht divisions once symbolised German ambitions to dominate Europe. Eighty years on, the position is wholly reversed. Blitzkrieg has been replaced by snooze-krieg as the leading candidates to succeed Angela Merkel in this month’s safety-first federal election seek to perpetuate modern-day Germany’s ingrained reluctance to lead Europe on the global stage.
As the world burns, Germany slumbers. Whether the challenge is an accelerating climate crisis, crumbling EU unity, China’s abusive authoritarianism, a collapsing US security umbrella or bottomless Russian malevolence, Europe’s most powerful country too often fails to take a stand. Emmanuel Macron’s France strikes out randomly. Boris Johnson’s Britain claims, delusionally, to “punch above its weight”. Berlin, in contrast, fights shy.
Popular Merkel’s 16-year reign is generally held to have been good for Germany at home. Voters are sad to see her go, and this regret is shared abroad. Germany’s first female leader is viewed as a competent, reassuring, trustworthy figure who eschewed the histrionics and gaffes of male politicians. Her courageous response to the Syrian refugee crisis and personal handling of the terrible twins – chauvinist ogres Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – is widely admired.
Yet longevity should not be confused with achievement. Nor is good management a substitute for strategic thinking. Helmut Schmidt, the late West German chancellor, memorably quipped: “Wer Visionen hat, soll zum Arzt gehen” (“Anyone who has visions should go to the doctor”). Germans, it is said, have a historically justified fear of charismatic leaders. No one ever accused Merkel of being a visionary or oozing charisma. Instead, her reluctance to dwell on the big picture has produced the very opposite problem.
Merkel’s response to the 2009 European sovereign debt crisis is a case in point. Admirers say she saved the eurozone by backing bailouts for its hardest-hit members. Critics say the short-sighted rescue primarily benefited German banks. Harsh austerity measures were imposed on Greece and poorer countries, widening the EU’s north-south divide. Their legacy continues to boost Eurosceptic, far-right nationalist-populist movements.
Merkel stands accused of prioritising German economic and business interests over EU solidarity and democratic and human rights values – an approach only half-jokingly referred to as “Merkantilism”. Just consider her now lapsed European parliamentary alliance with Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s EU law-breaking, gay-bashing, authoritarian leader. It’s claimed, for example, that he backed Merkel’s choice as European Commission president, the sadly inept Ursula von der Leyen, in return for political protection.
“Merkel’s alliance with Orbán wasn’t just about party politics; it was characteristically Merkantilistic,” analysts Matthias Matthijs and R Daniel Kelemen claim. “Hungary is a major, low-wage, near-shore manufacturing centre for German multinationals... Merkel recognised how good relations with the Orbán regime served German commercial interests and used her enormous influence to shield him from EU criticism.”
Merkel is similarly attacked for putting profit before principle in China, whose global bullying and human rights abuses have not deterred huge German export growth. Russia is another sore point. Ukraine and east European states strongly oppose her support for the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline. The US fears Putin’s pet project will increase Europe’s energy dependency, but its warnings are ignored.
Merkel’s friendly dealings with dictatorships and autocrats, justified as promoting peaceful engagement and influence, have arguably produced few political benefits while undermining European principles. Her efforts to reverse Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea got nowhere. Her careful protests over crackdowns in Hong Kong and Belarus, and the poisoning of Putin’s best-known critic, Alexei Navalny, had little practical effect.
Under Merkel’s risk-averse leadership, Germany has hindered development of a credible, independent European defence and security capability, much to Macron’s frustration and, perhaps, to Russian, Chinese and US delight. And as the Greens’ leader, Annalena Baerbock, notes, her record on another big issue – the climate crisis – also falls well short of inspirational.
By hastily renouncing nuclear power after Japan’s Fukushima accident, Merkel left Germany more reliant on coal and imported gas. A push towards renewables has since slowed. July’s disastrous flooding in western regions raised the stakes. She now admits Germany must do much more to reduce carbon emissions. But it will not be done by her.
Merkel’s failure to lead by example on some of the main challenges facing Europe, drawing on the authority conferred by her long tenure and experience, is the biggest disappointment of her time as chancellor. Even her “Wir schaffen das!” (“We can do this!”) moment during the 2015 refugee crisis cannot disguise the subsequent failure to follow through with an EU-wide asylum pact. To be fair, Merkel, unlike others, tried her best.
Perhaps she is guilty of excessive pragmatism. Perhaps she worries too much about old ghosts. Or perhaps this reluctance to offer a strong lead in Europe reflects an active preference, shared by Germans generally, for a quiet life in a world noisily going to hell all around them. Some may call that sensible, others foolish and selfish – given that Germany’s prosperity pivots on stability.
Whatever the truth, Merkel’s most likely successors, Armin Laschet or Olaf Scholz, show no sign of changing the steady-as-she-goes, beware-foreign-entanglements mantras of the Merkel school of statecraft. Both men are cast as the “continuity candidate”. On big global issues, both are doing their desperatebest to sound and look like Merkel – though “Mutti” wears the trousers far better than they.
Who will speak for Europe in a world run ragged by conflict, populism, pandemic and poverty? Certainly not an ineffectual Brussels bureaucracy. Britain has thrown itself under a geopolitical bus. France lacks the strength. And strategically underperforming Germany is asleep at the wheel. The answer should be obvious.
Unless and until Berlin awakes and, like Rapunzel, lets down her hair, the encircling enemies of democracy will continue to thrive."

Whatever the truth, Merkel’s most likely successors, Armin Laschet or Olaf Scholz, show no sign of changing the steady-as-she-goes, beware-foreign-entanglements mantras of the Merkel school of statecraft. Both men are cast as the “continuity candidate”. On big global issues, both are doing their desperatebest to sound and look like Merkel – though “Mutti” wears the trousers far better than they.
Who will speak for Europe in a world run ragged by conflict, populism, pandemic and poverty? Certainly not an ineffectual Brussels bureaucracy. Britain has thrown itself under a geopolitical bus. France lacks the strength. And strategically underperforming Germany is asleep at the wheel. The answer should be obvious.
Unless and until Berlin awakes and, like Rapunzel, lets down her hair, the encircling enemies of democracy will continue to thrive."

Of all the political posters and billboards that line the streets of German towns and cities this late summer, the ones most likely to stop commuters in their tracks are those bathed in traffic-light red.
Using a stark colour scheme usually exclusive to the Marxist-Leninist parties on the fringe of the German left, the posters are surprising in more ways than one: in the centre of the picture sits a bald, suited man who looks less like a leftwing rabble-rouser promising you radical change than a middle manager at a regional building society scrutinising your loan application.
The bureaucrat-on-the-barricades act seems to have worked: three weeks before Germany heads to the polls on 26 September, the grey man in the suit, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, has unexpectedly jostled himself into pole position to succeed outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel.
Vice-chancellor in Germany’s coalition government for the last four years, he is currently doing a better job convincing the public that he can be the Merkel continuity candidate than Armin Laschet, the contender fielded by her own party.
Polls published last week show Scholz’s centre-left SPD leading Laschet’s Christian Democratic Union by 3-5 percentage points, a position Germany’s oldest existing party last enjoyed when it won federal elections under Gerhard Schröder in 2002.
For much of the past decade, the SPD has looked like a spent force, drained of energy through compromising coalitions with Merkel’s party, lacking in distinctive profile after slaloming from the left to the centre of the political spectrum and back again.
But the current moment suggests that all that can be rectified when you have the good fortune to go up against two less than impressive competitors – and if you can pull together a tight, well-run campaign.
“The SPD has come up with the perfect campaign,” said Frank Stauss, a political communication expert whose agency has previously advised the German Social Democrats and Austria’s conservative ÖVP. “It is 100% in tune with Scholz’s message.”
The CDU only agreed to nominate Laschet as Merkel’s successor in April and its campaign has looked far from tailor-cut around its candidate, and has come across as comically incongruous. One CDU poster has the slogan “So that Germany stays strong” next to a picture of Laschet, a politician seen as more of a liberal compromise builder than a forceful protector (not least through virtue of his surname, lasch means “lackadaisical” in German).
The Green party, which has nominated Annalena Baerbock as its first ever chancellor candidate and briefly surged to the top of the polls in May, gives the impression of having lost confidence after the 40-year-old stumbled over plagiarism allegations. Many of its posters depict her in tandem with Green co-leader Robert Habeck, or fall back on Photostock images of young people and families on cargo-bikes.
Only the SPD’s campaign is focused entirely around the man it wants to push into the top seat. Devised by Raphael Brinkert, a sports marketing specialist who has run campaigns for footballers like Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich, it makes a virtue of Scholz’s image as a boring but competent technocrat.
In several posters, the blank-faced former mayor of Hamburg leans back and holds a card with election pledges into the camera: a minimum wage rise, stable pensions, the construction of 400,000 homes a year. Scholz packt das an is the slogan, “Scholz will sort it”. Brinkert, who started working on the campaign in May 2020, has styled his client as an efficient executor, not a politician desperate to be liked. “Sometimes those who dare get lucky,” Brinkert said when asked what politicians could learn from sports marketing.
Arresting posters and catchy slogans on their own don’t win elections, and even within Scholz’s party few doubt the SPD would have continued its decline had the CDU and Greens candidates not proved so gaffe-prone and unpopular with the electorate. “You may as well cite chaos theory,” said one party staffer in explanation of the centre-left surge.
But if posters could swing elections, it would be in Germany, where printed matter still plays an important role. “Right now, the political poster is undergoing a real renaissance,” said Stauss.
Regulations about political advertising limit the playtime of party TV broadcasts and Stauss said there were too many channels nowadays for any one party to dominate on social media.
“Each year, we say we want to spend less on expensive poster campaigns, and each year we find they still make a difference,” he said. “Voters still have to get out, and they notice if you don’t show face in the street: they think you’ve given up the fight.”
This will be a vote without precedent in Germany: no previous election in Europe’s largest economy has been fought while the incumbent chancellor is still immensely popular yet not running for re-election. In such a constellation, small gestures can make a big difference for the politicians who are pitching themselves as Merkel’s continuity candidate.
In the first of three televised debates, Scholz gave off such an accurate impression of Merkel’s style – noncommittally rising above the fray while his rivals tore into each other – that most viewers voted him as their winner of the evening and the chancellor herself had to intervene the following day to clarify there was a “huge difference for the future of Germany” between the Social Democrat and herself.
In coming weeks, Scholz will probably do more to remind voters that his tenure as finance minister and vice-chancellor gives him the kind of international clout that his conservative and ecological rivals lack.
On the campaign trail, the 63-year-old has got the loudest cheers when mentioning plans for a global minimum corporate tax rate – a scheme Scholz rightly claims to have kicked off with his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire.
Sceptics say the SPD’s lead will start to evaporate once voters have had more time to scrutinise the policies behind the billboard slogans, as it did with the Green party and the CDU.
The conservatives have over the last week mounted a concerted campaign against a “leftward drift” they foresee if Scholz were to forge a coalition with the Greens and leftwing Die Linke – an option the centre-left has so far declined to rule out for tactical reasons. Scholz’s supporters say their opponents have already missed the chance to turn the tide. As a result of the pandemic, 40-50% of the electorate are expected to vote by mail this year. Postal ballots have been with voters for two weeks."

In September 1998, when a relatively youthful Gerhard Schröder defeated Helmut Kohl and ended his 16-year reign as German chancellor, the victorious leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) told supporters that the country had opted for “a change of generation”. Mr Schröder’s triumph turned a page on the cold war era, aligning Germany with a fresh-faced centre-left resurgence in western democracies led by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. It was, in the political vernacular, a quintessential “change” election.
Almost a quarter of a century later, Angela Merkel will stand down of her own accord later this month – the first chancellor to do so – after equalling Mr Kohl’s longevity in office. But this time, ahead of a 26 September election, German voters seem to be somewhat reluctant to move on. None of Ms Merkel’s prospective replacements come close to matching her popularity. Fewer than one in five see the chancellor’s own preferred successor, the CDU/CSU candidate, Armin Laschet, as the best option to replace her. Caught on camera laughing during a visit to a town devastated by floods, Mr Laschet has fought a lacklustre campaign and has become a liability for his party. A poll last week found that from highs of around 35% at the start of the year, the CDU/CSU’s ratings have plunged on Mr Laschet’s watch to the low twenties and fallen just behind the SPD for the first time since 2006. The Greens electrified the contest by topping polls in the spring. Their extraordinary surge seemed to embody a widespread desire for a more environmentally driven politics to meet net zero pledges. But they too have lost their mojo as the party’s candidate for chancellor, the inexperienced Annalena Baerbock, struggles to recover from allegations of plagiarism and financial mismanagement.
The travails of the two former frontrunners have thus cleared the stage for the battered and bruised SPD, for years a symbol of the apparently terminal decline of European centre-left parties. Remarkably, the SPD now narrowly leads the race to take charge of the new era. Yet even this Lazarus-style resurrection can be seen as a tribute to the enduring appeal of Merkelism. The 63-year-old SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, has served as a fiscally cautious finance minister in the outgoing government. He is basing his pitch on being a safe pair of hands, much in the former chancellor’s mould. A recent SPD campaign ad even joked of Mr Scholz as “Er kann Kanzlerin” (“he can do chancellor”), using the feminine form of the German word to underline a message of continuity with his predecessor.
If Ms Merkel were standing, she would almost certainly win. After 16 years in office, that is some compliment to her political skills and consensual style of government. But as Germany faces up to major challenges, such as meeting some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world and dealing with a rapidly ageing population, a new generation of leaders will need to make their mark in new times. The makeup of any future coalition is almost impossible to predict, such is the uncertainty of a race in which the lead has changed hands three times. The economically liberal FDP, for example, could become a kingmaker after 26 September, cancelling out centre-left commitments to higher taxes, more state spending and green investment.

Angela Merkel has waded into the fray of Germany’s election campaign by dismissing her centre-left vice-chancellor’s attempt to model himself as her continuity candidate, as her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) tries to revive its flagging fortunes with warnings of “chaos” under a leftwing coalition government.
The intervention comes as the Social Democratic party (SPD) candidate for chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Merkel’s deputy in her fourth and final cabinet, is doing an increasingly effective job of convincing voters he is more likely to continue the chancellor’s centrist and rational legacy than the candidate representing her own party.
Scholz repeatedly emphasised his and Merkel’s agreements on key policy areas in a TV debate on Sunday, for which polls declared him a clear winner.
But on Tuesday Merkel dismissed the comparison, saying there was a “huge difference for the future of Germany” between Scholz and herself.
“With me as chancellor, there would never be a coalition in which the Left party [Die Linke] is involved,” Merkel said at a joint press conference with the visiting Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in Berlin. “And it is an open question whether Olaf Scholz shares that stance or not.”
No poll published over the last few days indicates that a coalition between the SPD, the Greens and Die Linke – three broadly leftwing parties – is likely to gain a governing majority at the national vote on 26 September.
But a surge of support for the SPD over the course of the last two weeks means a left-leaning “R2G” coalition is not completely unimaginable either, with one poll published on Tuesday putting such a power-sharing deal at 47%.
The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are increasingly focusing their campaigns on such a scenario. A video, shared on CDU and CSU social media channels this week, warns voters they have to make a “decision on the direction of travel” for Germany’s future, that they face a choice between “a strong centre or leftwing chaos”.
A new CSU website, Linksrutsch-verhindern.de (“Stop the leftward drift”), is illustrated with a banner of Scholz and politicians from the Greens and Die Linke in the style of Marx, Lenin and Stalin.
Their messaging has reminded German commentators of a campaign slogan the CDU first trialled in 1994 and has returned to whenever a coalition with Die Linke has been in sight at national or state level: “Let’s stride into the future … but not in red socks.”
The CDU candidate, Armin Laschet, this week said his campaign was more than a nostalgic revival of the “red socks” campaign: “The Left party is a party that does not belong to Germany’s government,” he said.
Few believe either Scholz or the Green candidate, Annalena Baerbock, would genuinely favour governing the country in an alliance with Die Linke, the successor party of the Socialist Unity party that used to govern East Germany.
Die Linke’s commitment to scrapping Nato and ending all German troop deployments abroad sits at odds with the two larger parties’ priorities, and would provide a permanent line of attack for the opposition.
“Anyone who seriously wants to hoax people into believing that Olaf Scholz – let me repeat: Olaf Scholz – will install a communist dictatorship in Germany and prance through the Bundestag with the red flag has got a screw loose,” the SPD deputy chair, Kevin Kühnert, said on Sunday night.
But in the TV debate that preceded his comments, Scholz and Baerback also neglected to emphatically rule out the option of a coalition with Die Linke, which they may see as useful tactical leverage for coalition talks.
Scholz merely said any government led by him would be tied to “indispensable” principles that included a clear commitment to Nato and the European Union, as well as a responsible approach to economic growth and domestic security."

Pope Francis has criticised the west’s recent involvement in Afghanistan – inadvertently quoting Vladimir Putin in doing so.
In a wide-ranging interview with Spanish radio station COPE, the pope was asked for his thoughts on the redrawn political map of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of the US and its allies from the country after 20 years of war.
The pope said he had been moved by a quote from the Germany chancellor, Angela Merkel, whom he described as “one of the world’s great political figures”.
He said he would attempt to translate the quote into Spanish: “It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from the outside and building democracy in other countries, ignoring the traditions of the people.”
While the phrase was open to interpretation, he said he “felt a sense of wisdom” in Merkel’s words.
The words, however, were not uttered by Merkel but rather the Russian president last month as he demanded that countries stop meddling in Afghanistan during the chancellor’s recent visit to Moscow.
During the visit, which marked an end to one of Europe’s most complex and politically fraught relationships, Putin called on the west to “stop the irresponsible policy of imposing foreign values from abroad”, and characterised efforts to support the previous Afghan government as an attempt to “build democracy in other countries according to foreign templates”.
In the press conference with Putin, Merkel conceded that efforts to allow the Afghan population to collectively chart out its future had fallen short. “I must say that, in our development cooperation efforts, we did not want to force any system on Afghanistan,” she said.
“But we saw that millions of girls were glad to go to school and that women could participate. There are many in Afghanistan who are very, very unhappy about developments now,” she added.
In the pope’s interview, which aired on Wednesday after being recorded at the Vatican late last week, Francis said it appeared that “all eventualities were not taken into account” as western allies departed from Afghanistan.
“I don’t know if there will be any review [of what happened], but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new authorities [of Afghanistan],” he said. “I say deceit or a lot of naiveté, I don’t understand.”
He called on Christians to engage in “prayer, penance and fasting”, describing the actions as what was needed in “moments of crisis” such as this one.
The radio station, which is owned by Spain’s Catholic bishops’ conference, said before the interview that the pope had been given the chance to vet the content before it aired.
The Vatican did not reply to a request for comment."

As Maren Heinzerling crossed hands with the most powerful woman in the world, leaned backwards and started to spin her dance partner in a circle, she began to worry.
“What are you doing,” the retired railway engineer recalled thinking. “You are spinning around the room with Angela Merkel.” Heinzerling had to grip the chancellor’s hands tighter as they span faster with each rotation.
“I realised I couldn’t let go, or the chancellor would have careered across the hall and smashed into a wall.”

The scene dates back to 17 May 2017, when Heinzerling, then 78, was invited to Merkel’s chancellory in Berlin to pick up a national award for her volunteering work, teaching physics to primary-school-age refugee children.
Heinzerling had improvised their little dance number after Merkel, who has a PhD in quantum chemistry, had been too quick on an experiment the science teacher had devised for the cameras to do their work.
“But then I remembered this other experiment,” Heinzerling said, and she spontaneously grabbed the chancellor’s hands.
The point of the dance was to demonstrate centrifugal force, which in Newtonian mechanics is the invisible force that appears to act on a body moving in a circular path.
Merkel’s lack of a poker face has become immortalised in comedy sketches, her eye-rolls and frowns at press conferences and obligatory public functions are memes on social media. But in pictures of the her dance with Heinzerling, she is smiling.
“My impression was that Frau Merkel cared for nothing else in the world at that moment,” Heinzerling told the Guardian in March, three weeks before she died unexpectedly.
Perhaps the German chancellor was smiling because she knew that the photographers had a chance to snap a perfect metaphor for her idea of leadership. The scientific concept of centrifugal forces has been repeatedly cited by Merkel and her spokespeople to describe political challenges. Over the course of 16 years, she has dedicated most of her political energy towards nullifying crises that could have spiralled out of control.
When Merkel clears her desk at the chancellory, she will have matched the record previously held by her mentor, the “eternal chancellor” Helmut Kohl.
Unlike all her seven male predecessors, she will be stepping down of her own will, at the end of a full term, and while her popularity ratings remain so phenomenally high that her three most likely successors have all in different ways modelled themselves on her.
Merkel managed to retain her power by moving her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) into the centre of the political spectrum, entering coalitions with both the centre-right Free Democratic party (FDP) and the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD). Merkel’s CDU became the sun that other parties could merely orbit. A coalition with the Green party long looked like the logical conclusion of her realignment: in 2018, it only failed because of the reluctance of the FDP.
Critics say the cost of Merkel’s success has been an erosion of the political landscape: by co-opting other parties’ policies and programmes, she has made Germany’s traditional parties increasingly indistinguishable. The CDU has struggled to put up a united front as it approaches the post-Merkel era: party insiders fear a defeat at the September vote could throw the once-dominant force of German postwar politics into an existential crisis that could culminate in a split between centrists and conservative hardliners.
Having spent the first 35 years of her life on the eastern side of the iron curtain, Merkel already had first-hand experience of how quickly political systems can unravel once forces of flight are unleashed.
After winning her first election in 2005, Germany’s first female chancellor brought to her office a heightened awareness that even small decisions in the most populous and economically powerful country at the heart of the European Union could have direct consequences for the continent as a whole.
“Merkel has two core qualities,” said Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of Süddeutsche Zeitung and author of her authorised biography. “She is risk-averse and a centrist in the sense that she wants to bring people together rather than alienate them. These qualities apply to domestic politics as well as the European Union, which is a political constellation that has an intrinsic tendency to drift apart.”
Months into Merkel’s second term in office, the EU risked being wrenched apart by events on the stock markets. A global recession sparked by a burst housing bubble in the US triggered a balance-of-payment crisis in the eurozone, which member states were unable to counteract through devaluation because they were tied into the same currency.
As the crisis intensified, politicians in northern Europe called on countries like Greece or Italy to be kicked out of the club, which would have amounted to a de-facto break-up of the eurozone.
Against domestic resistance, Merkel took the necessary steps to keep the arms of the eurozone member states tightly locked together, negotiating bailouts for hardest-hit states and giving political support for massive liquidity injections on behalf of the European Central Bank.
As France’s influence wavered under presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, and Britain began to peel off from the bloc of nations, Merkel rose to become Europe’s single most powerful broker of compromises.
She retained that role in the years leading up to and after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, patiently enduring the special pleading of British prime ministers in the hope of keeping the UK within the EU’s orbit while keeping a united front with the other 26 member states. “We must do everything to prevent centrifugal forces,” she said in a speech shortly after the Brexit vote.
“Merkel’s greatest legacy is that she managed to keep the EU together in an era of intense strain, something that requires political will power and usually some German money,” Kornelius said.
Perhaps the greatest irony of her leadership is that it took a woman from the east to assuage fears, shared more or less openly by most European states at the time, around a post-reunification resurgence of German aggression.
In spite of her erstwhile criticism of the Schröder government’s pacifist stance on Iraq, Germany under her leadership engaged in no new wars other than pro-forma participation in European military missions against Islamic State and in Mali. In 2011, the same year that Merkel’s second government ended military conscription, it refrained from joining the Nato mission in Libya.
“She steered Germany into the centre of Europe and increased its influence without being perceived as a threat by its neighbours,” said Kornelius. “That’s a historic achievement.”
Yet while Germany may no longer perceived as a threat, another kind of suspicion has grown: that Merkel has turned her country into a kind of oversized Switzerland, a state that favours chequebook diplomacy over military conflict but remains politically neutral less out of principle than to protect its trade links.
Merkel provoked Chinese ire when she met the Dalai Lama at the start of her leadership, but intensified commercial ties to the People’s Republic thereafter, with nigh-annual visits to Beijing and exports tripling over the course of a decade and a half.
She aided Russian dissidents like Alexei Navalny, but has also relentlessly pursued a Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that many fear will increase Russia’s geopolitical influence. The distrust such decisions has sown in Ukraine, other eastern European states and the Baltics is often ignored in Berlin’s political circles.
While Merkel always took the right steps in moments of crisis to guarantee that Europe would not spin out of control, she has done little to stabilise the continent’s joint political structures by deepening them.
“The image of centrifugal forces is key to Merkel’s stance on Europe, but the same image also reveals her greatest flaw,” said Josef Janning, senior associate fellow of the German Council on Foreign Relations.
“She never understood that centrifugal forces can only be contained in the long run by strengthening the centripetal force, to pull bodies of mass more strongly to the centre.” Partly as a result of German vetoes, Europe’s fiscal and banking union remains incomplete. A common European asylum system remains out of reach. A sovereign European security strategy, allowing the union of states to act more independently of the United States, is still an idea rather than a reality.
“Germany under Merkel hasn’t amplified Europe’s ambition,” said Janning. “It has given up articulating an idea where Europe should eventually end up. It has simply made itself comfortable in an imperfect set-up”.
At its best, Merkel’s almost scientific approach to decision-making meant she understood political challenges as complex problems that cannot be solved with soundbites. At no point in her 16 years as chancellor was this more apparent than in the summer of 2015, when more than one million migrants and refugees, most of whom had been uprooted by the war in Syria, crossed into Europe.
Merkel’s decision not to close Germany’s borders to those arriving via Hungary and shelter around 890,000 refugees over the course of that year is well known. Less well known are the alternative scenarios sketched out by her advisers.
Closed doors on the German border would have meant a build-up of refugees on the Balkan route, causing chaos in a region still recovering from a decade of civil wars. It could have left Greece, the focal point of the first crisis of the Merkel era, to cope with millions of refugees on its own. And it would have risked destroying the Schengen system, the foundational principle of open borders within Europe. Taking in Syria’s refugees, not stopping them, looked like the anti-centrifugal option.
“One of Merkel’s greatest strengths has always been that she thought about political problems rationally, and in the long term, when most of her male antagonists thought about them emotionally, in the short term,” said Gerald Knaus, the chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a thinktank that advises EU member-states on migration policy. “She has a scientist’s scepticism: can this solution actually be made to work?
“In 2015, for example, she knew that closing the German border to refugees wasn’t actually an option while her government was committed to not use violence to deter individuals. In recent years some governments, like Croatia on its border with Bosnia, were prepared to treat refugees cruelly. But Germany in 2015 made an ethical decision not to.”
The events of summer 2015 did unleash new forces, which threatened to overstretch the capacities of the German state – the staff of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees increased five-fold that year – and eventually to loosen Merkel’s own hold on political power.
Anti-immigration party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which had originally been founded in opposition to Merkel’s bailouts during the eurozone crisis, become an openly rightwing populist outfit and found a new stride, entering parliament for the first time as the third largest party in 2017.
Rightwing extremist circles were further radicalised, increasingly targeting asylum shelters with arson attacks in the coming years and assassinating a CDU Merkel ally with pro-immigration views in 2019. No other country in Europe saw as much severe and fatal rightwing violence that same year as Germany.
Yet once again Merkel understood how to slow down the dance: she resisted calls to step down, and sat out the conflict with her inner-party rivals.
A “money for refugees” deal with Turkey, and similar arrangements with Libya and Morocco, meant the number of migrants and refugees arriving in Germany dropped off dramatically. The AfD has carved out a steady presence in the former regions of Germany’s east, but has struggled to formulate coherent policies beyond its anti-immigration stance and looks set to underperform on its 2017 showing this September.
“In the end, Merkel survived the refugee crisis because she resisted the pressure to make promises she couldn’t keep,” said Knaus, who is credited with devising the refugee deal between Turkey and the EU. “Others made that mistake and became unbelievable as a result.”
The German chancellor’s heightened awareness of the centrifugal forces inherent in dynamic situations has also given her a tendency to slow down processes of a more progressive nature. Merkel, Germany’s environment minister in Kohl’s fifth cabinet in the 90s, has throughout her tenure spoken of the climate crisis as a “global challenge”. But her own record on the subject is mixed.
The decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany was one that Merkel inherited from the preceding Social Democrat-Green coalition government, but one which she had started to put into reverse gear in her second term before U-turning again after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Germany is now on course to close its last six remaining nuclear plants by the end of 2022.
Critics say the nuclear exit has increased Germany’s reliance on dirty carbon-based coal and gas, though supporters of the policy argue the exit plan drove a boom for renewable energy sources that would not have happened otherwise.
“The optimists were right,” said Uwe Leprich, a climate policy specialist at the Saarland University of Applied Sciences. Balancing nuclear and renewable sources on the same energy grid, he argued, would have been an enormous technical challenge that would have slowed down green innovation.
Instead, Germany looked for a few years like it wanted to become the world’s green champion. At the height of a boom in solar power, German companies producing photo-voltaic modules hogged 20% of the global market. In the years after Fukushima, the number of new wind farms built every year gained pace dramatically: the amount of electricity gained from wind blowing across German land and sea doubled to 106 TWH within six years.
But as Germany’s Energiewende (“energy turn”) picked up speed, Merkel’s government tried to reduce its momentum. Renewable energy, her cabinet argued, needed to outgrow the subsidy regime of old and learn to finance itself through the market alone. Since 2017, wind farms are no longer paid set feed-in premiums but have to compete for subsidies in an auction system.
The number of new wind farms has dropped off dramatically since then. Since the start of the year 2018, Germany has built 1,728 new turbines – fewer than in the year 2017 alone. The slowdown could now threaten Germany’s target to cover 65% of its electricity needs through renewable energy by 2030.
A reluctance to support new technologies as aggressively as its competitors has already put an end to the solar boom: there are no German companies among the world’s top 10 manufacturers of solar panels. Seven of them are Chinese.
“Germany got scared of its own courage,” said Leprich. “We fell back to the energy blueprints of the noughties, and ignored new technologies that could have have offered alternative means to store energy.
“Under Merkel, Germany gambled away its former status as a renewable energy leader and has long been overtaken by nations like Denmark or the Netherlands.”"

The three politicians battling it out for the top job in German politics have clashed in a TV debate during which the leader of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats failed to regain lost momentum and ceded the role of continuity candidate to his centre-left rival.
Polls published before the first of three televised debates suggested the race to lead Germany into the post-Merkel era was more wide open than ever, with Olaf Scholz’s SPD in a narrow lead over Armin Laschet’s CDU and Annalena Baerbock’s Green party following closely in third place.
A snap poll of viewers carried out after the programme suggested Sunday’s debate had done little to change voters’ minds, with 36% declaring Scholz the winner, ahead of Baerbock on 30% and Laschet on 25%.
In a combative but respectful two-hour debate that covered the war in Afghanistan, the future use of military drones, the climate crisis, measures to contain Covid-19 and the use of gender-neutral pronouns, Baerbock and Laschet went on the offensive to make up for lost ground.
Laschet, whose CDU has haemorrhaged about 15 percentage points in polls since the start of the year, described recent events in Afghanistan as a “disaster” not just for western allies but the German government – and by implication the chancellor he hopes to succeed.
The most animated and talkative of the three candidates in Sunday’s debate, he accused the resurgent SPD of blocking Germany’s army from being equipped with state-of-the-art hardware and warned of the Greens’ plans to burden businesses with environmental restrictions and higher taxes.
At times, Laschet’s energetic but wordy performance seemed to underline rather than banish the nervousness in CDU party ranks: the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia fluffed his concluding statement in which he tried to liken his own “steadfastness in adverse weather” to the “wind of change” experienced by the country as a whole.
Baerbock, who has struggled to recover from allegations of a doctored CV and plagiarised passages in her book, tried to renew her pitch as the plain-speaking candidate of change and reform.
“Years of wait and see under the grand coalition have not done this country any good,” she said of the power-sharing arrangement between CDU and SPD that has governed Germany for the last eight years. “We need a genuine new start.”
Baerbock criticised Merkel’s government for neglecting children and families during the pandemic, and accused her rivals of skirting around the issue of a ban on petrol and diesel engine cars, which she wants to enforce by 2030. The 40-year-old Green co-leader was the only of the three candidates who did not categorically rule out mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations for certain professions, saying it “should not be ruled out for the future”.
Scholz, meanwhile, appeared more reserved as his rivals tore into each other, opting for slower, Merkel-esque answers with a historical sweep. Repeatedly, the finance minister and deputy chancellor laced his statements with reminders that “the chancellor and I” concurred on various issues.
Laschet tried to call Scholz’s bluff, accusing him of “acting like Angela Merkel and talking like Saskia Esken”, the SPD co-leader whom conservatives have discovered as the totemic representative of the party’s leftwing.
The CDU candidate tried to force his SPD rival to rule out a coalition with the Greens and the leftwing Die Linke, but failed to land a decisive blow. Scholz, who hails from the right of the SPD, evaded the challenge and declined to rule out an option he could use as leverage in upcoming coalition talks."

Almost 16 years after she first became Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel’s approval ratings in five major European countries and the United States remain higher than those of any other current world leader, a new poll shows.
Asked by YouGov whether they had a favourable or unfavourable opinion of Merkel, who steps down next month after four terms in office, more respondents delivered a positive verdict than a negative one in all six countries surveyed.
The veteran chancellor, who since her election in 2005 has worked with four US and French presidents, five British prime ministers and eight Italian heads of government, scored net positive ratings of +61 in Spain, +49 in France and +30 in Germany.
Opinions in Italy, the US and UK were slightly less positive at +23, +17 and +15, but of other world leaders, only Joe Biden – just eight months into his presidency and still benefiting from a “not Trump” effect, with polling carried out before this month’s chaotic events in Afghanistan – was even remotely close.
Canada’s Justin Trudeau also scored positively, while France’s Emmanuel Macron was rated positively in only two countries: Germany and Spain. Other major figures, including China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi of India and Britain’s Boris Johnson, recorded net negative ratings in all six countries surveyed.
The UK prime minister scored net negative ratings of -22 in Britain, -40 in Italy, -53 in Germany, -24 in France, -48 in Spain and -2 in the US. The least popular world leader was Xi, with an average net negative approval rating of -55.
Variously described as the world’s most powerful woman and de facto leader of the EU, Merkel – measured, cautious, methodical, pragmatic, frequently noncommittal – was most appreciated for her handling of Germany’s economy.
Among people who had heard of her, the poll showed a net positive rating of +46 across the six countries for Merkel’s economic management, along with average positive ratings of +44.5 for improving Germany’s reputation abroad and +34 for her impact on German society.
Her action on climate change and response to the coronavirus crisis also got favourable reviews, but her efforts in dealing with Brexit were viewed less positively, particularly in the UK and her handling of the Greek debt crisis and Europe’s 2015 migration crisis was rated negatively in most countries.
On the eve of her departure and with Germany’s post-Merkel future looking increasingly uncertain, most respondents who knew who Merkel was in Germany, France, Spain and Italy ranked her among the five most powerful global figures, compared to about a third of Britons (31%) and Americans (36%).
The survey was carried out between 9 July and 10 August with representative national samples of more than 1,000 people."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/23/afghanistan-what-does-each-nation-hope-to-get-out-of-the-g7-meeting;2021-08-23;Afghanistan: what does each nation hope to get out of the G7 meeting?;"Analysis: Tuesday’s meeting called by Boris Johnson may include postmortem on Joe Biden’s handling of crisis
The emergency meeting of G7 nations on Tuesday – called by Boris Johnson as this year’s chair of the G7 – is in essence a gathering of the vanquished but faces a threefold agenda: how to ensure as many Afghans as possible can leave Kabul, and whether the US is prepared to stay beyond the original 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of all US forces; how a resettlement programme can be coordinated for the medium term; and finally, how to encourage the Taliban to form an inclusive government, including by threatening sanctions or withholding recognition.
But each country will bring its own concerns and an ugly postmortem on Joe Biden’s handling of the crisis cannot be ruled out.
Joe Biden, after months assiduously flattering his European allies, knows he has lost trust, including patently from across the political spectrum in the UK, normally one of America’s closest allies. The professional reputation of his foreign policy team has also taken a hammering, as have his plans to champion democracy.
As a gesture of reconciliation with Europe he may try to keep the airport evacuation open a few days longer.
He also faces questions about how he will prevent Afghanistan becoming a terrorist spawning ground, leaving the west exposed as it was 20 years ago.
Although his personal ratings are sliding, he believes the decision to abandon nation-building remains popular, and has won significant support among progressives demanding a new, less militarist style of American leadership.
UK ministers have been the most open in their criticism of Biden’s decision to press ahead with the evacuation timetable set by his predecessor, Donald Trump, but they accept that the Kabul airlift ends when the US forces decide to leave.
Boris Johnson has said he will seek an extension from Biden of the deadline for the withdrawal of US troops, and believes Biden, as a sign of goodwill, owes this to his European partners, even if the extension is a matter of days. But the Taliban has rejected this, and the firefight at the airport on Monday morning underscores the security risks.
UK defence ministers have come close to accepting the Taliban has a veto, and this requires Russia and China to persuade the Taliban that an early display of flexibility is in their self-interest. Regardless, the evacuation will soon have to enter a second, land-based phase that will be more contingent on Taliban approval.
The French share some of the UK’s sentiments. In the Élysée Palace’s account of a call between Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, released on Friday, but excised in the White House account, Macron described the mission to evacuate allies as a “moral responsibility” and told Biden: “We cannot abandon them.” France’s foreign and defence ministers are travelling to the United Arab Emirates to organise the airlift of refugees to regional Gulf powers.
The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has also said: “We are concerned about the deadline set by the United States on August 31. Additional time is needed to complete ongoing operations.”
France is likely to back set conditions on international recognition of the Taliban, a point that Boris Johnson has been emphasising in his bilateral calls with G7 leaders. Macron said: “Those who opt for war, obscurantism and indiscriminate violence, they are choosing isolation.”
But probably more than any G7 country, France has reason to feel vindicated by the Kabul debacle, and most inclined to challenge the continued assumption that a unilateralist US president can continue to dominate western foreign policy and defence. The need for Europe to become militarily more self-reliant has been a constant theme of Macron’s presidency, and Biden’s willingness to show that a Democrat administration is just as likely to act arbitrarily as a Republican one strengthens his case.
The French foreign policy establishment has been united in seeing Biden’s leadership as disastrous and a landmark in the decline of American leadership. Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador, for instance, predicted the chances of China invading Taiwan had increased by 20 percentage points, to 30%.
With an eye to his re-election next year, Macron has stressed that the EU cannot be expected to accept a wave of Afghan migration.
Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, is also the chair of the wider G20 and he has been angling to hold a special in-person G20 summit in Rome in September that would see Russia and China, two of the relative beneficiaries of the US withdrawal, come to explain their vision for Afghanistan.
Italy backs a deadline extension, but feels the past weeks must mark a turning point for EU defence. In an interview with La Repubblica, Gen Claudio Graziano, the president of the EU military committee and ex-chief of the Italian defence staff, said: “This is a defeat of the whole west and of what we have believed in over the last 20 years. It is certainly not the end of Nato, as some analysts have written, but it is clear that the Alliance must be rethought.” He claimed the EU needed “a central command that has sufficient forces at its disposal, effective funds, coordinated operational structures, investments in cyber and new technologies. The EU has a battlegroup with 5,000 soldiers ready for rapid deployment: in a situation like that of Kabul airport it could make a difference.” Italy is aiming to airlift out 2,500 refugees who had helped the country.
Angela Merkel, in the dying days of her chancellorship and in the midst of an election campaign in which her party is struggling, has been working the phones to persuade countries neighbouring Afghanistan, such as Pakistan and Tajikistan, to act as clearing houses for refugees. But despite the offers of cash, she is meeting resistance. Germany has so far flown 2,700 refugees out, and is talking to the Taliban about opening land routes.
Germany has been shaken by Kabul’s fall. Armin Laschet, who is the conservative candidate to succeed Merkel as chancellor in September’s election, has described Kabul’s fall as “the biggest debacle Nato has seen since its foundation and it is an epochal change that we are facing”. Heiko Mass, the foreign minister, has spoken of a collective error. The Green party’s Annalena Baerbock has suggested Germany take 50,000 refugees, proposed a meeting of the G7 with the countries bordering Afghanistan and called for a German inquiry into the overall fiasco.
Germany has been holding discussions with Turkey to see whether it would be willing to operate a civilian-only evacuation operation at Kabul airport after the military operation has ended.
Turkey has for weeks been offering to run Kabul airport, but had not initially envisaged taking on this operation in the context of a triumphant Taliban, but instead with the previous government in power. Turkey does not want to be the home of another mass evacuation of refugees, and favours an orderly migration process.
The G7 is now always attended by the two leaders of the European Union, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has asked all countries that participated in the mission in Afghanistan, European and non-European, to offer enough quotas for resettlement and safe routes so that shelter can be guaranteed. But Janez Janša, the prime minister of Slovenia, the current rotating president of the EU, insisted Europe “will not allow the strategic mistake of 2015 to be repeated. We must only help the individuals who helped us during the Nato operation.”
At the start of a national election campaign, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has found himself under attack for failing to foresee the pace of the Taliban advance and for the bureaucratic barriers facing Afghans who helped the Canadian forces and are now seeking refuge. Early signs in the polls shows Trudeau is suffering, even though Canada’s military involvement, which ended a decade ago, had enjoyed bipartisan support.
Canadian defence forces have airlifted out more than 1,000 Afghans who helped Canadian forces. Trudeau’s government has pledged to take 21,000 Afghans, but the desperate stories emerging from Kabul hardly help a government in office. Trudeau has not joined the criticism of Biden’s handling of the issue, but if the polls continue to turn against him, he may feel forced to do so.
The country least directly involved in the crisis, Japan is nevertheless sending three military aircraft to Afghanistan, starting on Monday, to evacuate its citizens and local staff. Japan’s key concern will be to ensure that Biden sticks to his pledge that the Afghanistan pullout reflects a reordering of Washington’s priorities towards competing with China in south-east Asia. Tokyo’s fear is that the withdrawal reflects a growing US isolationism."

Vladimir Putin has demanded that countries not interfere in Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul, saying the west “must stop the irresponsible policy of imposing foreign values from abroad”.
In extended remarks, Putin said he hoped the Taliban would “guarantee the security of locals and foreign diplomats” and that the country would not break apart after the withdrawal of US-led forces.
“You can’t call it a success,” he said when asked about the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, which was launched in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington DC. “But it’s not in our interests right now to stand on this point and talk about this as a failure. We were interested in the situation in the country being stable.”
Speaking at the Kremlin during a “farewell summit” with Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor, Putin said he was worried that militants from Afghanistan would try to infiltrate nearby countries under the guise of refugees. Russia has held military exercises with central Asian states and with China in recent weeks as concerns have grown that the Taliban’s return to power could lead to border clashes.
Putin attacked the west’s support for the previous Afghan government, saying it was counterproductive to try to “build democracy in other countries according to foreign templates”.
The remarks clearly addressed a key dispute between Moscow and the west that has played out in the conflicts in Syria and Libya and even over protests in Russia itself, as Putin has accused the west of backing his opposition.
Regional powers such as Russia, China and especially Pakistan are expected to increase their influence in Afghanistan as the western coalition executes a hasty and chaotic withdrawal from the country. The Russian embassy has remained open and maintained contacts with the Taliban as the militant group has assumed control for the first time since 2001.
Merkel has met with Putin more than 30 times over her 15 years as Germany’s leader, and has lobbied vocally for maintaining a dialogue with Russia even as many other countries in Europe believe Putin can no longer be reasoned with.
During the press conference, she called on Russia to release the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in prison on a conviction that is clearly political. Navalny was poisoned with a novichok agent in a failed attempt on his life one year ago on Friday.
“I demanded the release of Alexei Navalny and emphasised that we will continue following this case,” Merkel said. On Friday the UK sanctioned seven members of Russia’s FSB security service accused of participating in the nerve agent attack.
The two leaders also discussed the war in Donbass, where Russia has complained about a stalled peace process between the government in Kyiv and the separatist movement it controls in the country’s south-east.
Shortly after the two leaders met, Russia declared TV Rain and several other prominent independent media to be “foreign agents”, in the latest salvoes of a broad crackdown on press freedom in the country.
Despite the tensions between the two leaders, the summit began with a convivial air, as Putin delivered Merkel a bouquet in the Kremlin during what the German leader called “my farewell meeting … but also a working one”.
Putin called Germany “one of the main partners for us in Europe and in the world, in part because of your efforts over the past 16 years,” as he cast Merkel a fleeting smile before the talks began."

Angela Merkel’s “farewell visit” to the Kremlin on Friday will mark the end of one of Europe’s oldest and most complex political relationships, a tense 15-year tug-of-war between Europe’s elder statesperson and the bloc’s chief antagonist in Vladimir Putin.
Though deeply strained, their relationship never snapped. The German chancellor was reportedly distrustful of the former KGB officer from his first appearance in 2001 before the Bundestag, where he wooed MPs in fluent German as he called for unity against international terrorism.
The two never looked quite comfortable in conversation, whether in German or Russian. Both formidable leaders, their clashing political styles and visceral distrust for each other made their summits compelling viewing.
“No other politicians on the global stage have been so good at getting on badly over such a long time as these two,” wrote Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an article before Friday’s summit.
Merkel’s early wariness of Putin has been justified by the events of the past 15 years, from Russia’s annexation of Crimea to the poisoning attack on the dissident Alexei Navalny and assassinations in Europe.
There were personal slights too, such as an incident in 2007 when Putin allowed his labrador Koni to approach Merkel, who has a fear of dogs. “I understand why he has to do this – to prove he’s a man,” she told a group of reporters after. “He’s afraid of his own weakness.”
And yet, as many in the west have sought to isolate Putin, she and France’s Emmanuel Macron have urged EU nations to maintain a direct dialogue with the Russian leader. As she enters the twilight of her term in office, allies of the Russian president believe Merkel will seek a breakthrough in talks on conflict in Ukraine when she meets with Putin on Friday.
But what scope there is for cooperation remains unclear. The Minsk dialogue – the peace talks largely shepherded by Merkel between Ukraine, Germany, France, and the Russian-backed separatists in southeast Ukraine – are deadlocked.
And the meeting comes on the first anniversary of the poisoning attack on Alexei Navalny, the Putin opponent imprisoned in Russia in a case clearly motivated by political revenge. It was Berlin’s Charité clinic that confirmed he had been targeted with a novichok poison last year, a diagnosis Russia has rejected.
“This still unresolved case of course puts great strain on our relationship to Russia,” Merkel spokesperson Steffen Seibert said on Wednesday. “Our demands have still not been met. You will also know that Mr Navalny is unjustly imprisoned, spends his sentence in a penal camp and that there are even new charges being raised against him. All these points weigh on the relationship between Germany and Russia.”
Other critics see Merkel as far too soft on Russia. Her final visit comes as Nord Stream 2, a pipeline that links Russia to Germany, nears completion. The pipeline, which will allow Russia to deliver gas directly to Germany and bypass other countries that it currently uses for transit, has put eastern Europe on edge.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has called the pipeline a “powerful weapon being given to Russia”. He was reportedly “surprised” and “disappointed” after the US and Germany announced they had reached a deal to allow the pipeline to go ahead.
Merkel has said Germany will respond if Russia uses the threat of gas cutoffs to pressure Ukraine and she is scheduled to visit Kyiv on Sunday in what appears to be an attempt to allay concerns. The Atlantic Council, a thinktank strongly critical of Russia, has called on her to use the visit to “reject Russia’s imperial claims to Ukraine”.
Merkel is likely to phrase it differently when she meets Putin for the last time as chancellor this week. She has said she challenges the Russian president directly in private, adding: “When it comes to criticism of him, I don’t hold back.”
But her calls for direct talks with Putin, also supported by Macron, are increasingly facing a backlash in the EU, where some believe the Russian leader cannot be reasoned with.
“Overall, we have a lot of conflicts with Russia that unfortunately make our relationship very difficult,” she told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg earlier this year. “Nevertheless, I am someone who says we must always talk.”"

Germany’s leaders have set out new coronavirus regulations for the coming months, including abolishing free rapid testing to incentivise people to get vaccinated.
Widespread restrictions are likely to stay in place in an effort to tackle a growing case rate that is only expected to worsen in the coming weeks as holidaymakers return.
The most controversial rules apply to people who are not vaccinated. They will be expected to undergo tests as a condition for attending all manner of events, from indoor gatherings to restaurant visits to religious services.
The system of free rapid coronavirus testing, which has been widely available for months and has been used by Germans to get into venues such as theatres and football stadiums, is expected to be abolished from 11 October. After that, those who are unvaccinated – except for pregnant women, children or those advised against getting a vaccine on medical grounds – will have to pay for the tests. The hope is that people will no longer rely on the test system as a way of avoiding getting a vaccine.
Masks are also expected to remain obligatory in indoors spaces such as offices, schools, shops and on public transport.
The leaders of Germany’s 16 states, who met with the chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Tuesday to hammer out the new regulations, will reserve the right to tighten them further if the infection rate is deemed to be out of control.
Germany’s incidence rate for every 100,000 people over a seven-day period has almost doubled in the past three weeks, with one in 10 regions now registering a rate of more than 35.
It has led to concerns that another lockdown is looming, despite a lack of political will to impose one, not least with a federal election scheduled in six weeks.
The Bundestag is due to vote next month on whether “epidemic conditions” still apply in Germany, the legal basis on which the government is able to apply the strict measures currently in place, but which will expire on 11 September unless it is extended by MPs.
Critics of the decision to tighten current restrictions and to disadvantage those who have not taken up the offer of a vaccine have called it a “vaccine mandate by the back door”.
Among the most vocal opponents are the pro-business FDP party and the right wing populist AfD. One of the AfD’s leaders, Alice Weidel, on Tuesday accused the government of “threatening to split society”.
The government said the measures were necessary in order to protect vulnerable people and the unvaccinated. It said it would continue to adjust the regulations as the epidemic develops.
“The time for tighter measures for those who are not vaccinated will continue to be decided on by the federal government and the states,” a spokesperson said.
Wolfgang Kubicki, deputy leader of the FDP, accused the government of patronising ordinary citizens by suggesting they needed to be “protected from themselves”.
“The government is quite clearly dismissing the idea of aligning its measures with the interests of the public good, and instead is saying explicitly that citizens need to be protected from themselves,” he said. He added that Merkel’s coalition government “considered responsible citizens a risk factor who must if necessary be forced to do what’s good for them.”
Currently only 55% of Germans have received a full vaccination – including 80% of people older than 60 – with 62.5% having had one jab. For a country where the vaccine campaign got off to a sluggish start, it no longer compares as unfavourably to somewhere such as the UK – where the comparable rate is 59% and 70% – although the German figures still fall well short of the Merkel government’s stated goal for 85% of the population to have received a full vaccination by the end of the summer.
In addition to the hope that scrapping free testing will motivate people to get vaccinated, the government is also setting its store by teenagers, who have shown an unexpected willingness to take up the recent offer of jabs. So far, almost a quarter of 12- to 17-year-olds – more than one million people – have had one jab, according to Jens Spahn, the health minister.
Successful measures to increase vaccine uptake have included the offer of a free hotdog in the state of Thuringia, and the chance to combine shopping and a jab in three Ikea outlets in Berlin. The first 1,100 people who turn up for a jab this weekend at a conference centre in Freiburg will be offered free tickets for an SC Freiburg home game."

Seventy years ago, the 1951 UN refugee convention established the rights of refugees to seek sanctuary, and the obligations of states to protect them. Increasingly, it seems that much of Europe is choosing to commemorate the anniversary by ripping up some of the convention’s core principles.
So far this year, close to 1,000 migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean, more than four times the death toll for the same period in 2020. Many will have been economic migrants. Others will have been fleeing persecution. Increasingly, Europe does not care. All were “irregular”. And all must be discouraged and deterred through a strategy of cruelty.
The latest tragedy occurred last week, when at least 57 people died as a boat capsized in high winds off the Libyan coast. Sea patrols, whether by Italian or European agencies, have been significantly scaled back, making such disasters more likely. The owners of NGO rescue ships have been harried in the courts and seen their vessels seized. As Europe sits on its hands, thousands more desperate seafarers are being returned by Libyan security forces to detention centres where sexual violence, torture and abuse are rife.
In Greece, vast numbers are stuck in hopeless limbo, many in squalid overcrowded camps. After the devastating fire at the Moria camp in Lesbos last September, the European Commission rushed out a new “pact on migration and asylum”, emphasising the need to balance border protection and humanitarian concerns. But there is still no agreement between EU member states on the resettlement quotas and processes that could defuse the crisis. Meanwhile deafening “sound cannons” have been deployed on the Greek border with Turkey to drive migrants away and a Trumpian steel wall has been erected to block crossing points. Its next task may be to block thousands of Afghans fleeing the Taliban and currently making their way through Turkey.
There have been multiple accounts, from Greece and elsewhere, of refugees being expelled without their asylum applications being heard. Such so-called “pushbacks” contravene the 1951 convention. Politicians are also playing fast and loose with other principles signed up to 70 years ago. In northern Europe, Denmark’s Social Democratic government has passed a law to enable asylum seekers to be relocated thousands of miles away, while their claims are processed in a third country. The stated goal of Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, is that no more asylum applications should take place in Denmark. Her government is seeking to forcibly return hundreds of refugees to Syria – a move which is likely to be contested in the European court of human rights. Britain has criminalised migrants arriving by irregular routes, hoping thereby to force them to make asylum applications elsewhere.
Inexorably, unethically, Europe is defaulting to a cruel “fortress” strategy based on brute force and deterrence. Yet refugees make up only 0.6% of the EU’s population. The number of irregular migrants seeking to enter Europe bears no comparison to six years ago, when the Syrian civil war was at its height and Angela Merkel famously insisted “Wir schaffen das” (“We can do it”). With effective leadership and solidarity between countries, a humane approach to a complex problem would be possible. But the political will is missing. Since the migration crisis of 2015, the populist right has been allowed to dictate the terms of debate. Spooked by the rise of Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orbán and Marine Le Pen – and, in Britain, the influence of Nigel Farage – mainstream politicians across the continent have hardened their hearts, muffled their consciences and ceased to give would-be refugees a fair hearing. This lack of moral ambition betrays the spirit of the great humanitarian breakthrough made seven decades ago."

For the first time in its 145-year history, the Bayreuth opera festival has been opened by a female conductor.
Oksana Lyniv was applauded with warmth and vigour by the festival audience at the end of conducting Richard Wagner’s Flying Dutchman.
The festival had been forced to take a break last year due to the pandemic, delaying Lyniv’s long-awaited debut and increasing excitement around the event.
In the audience was the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, a Wagner aficionado, and her husband, Joachim Sauer, labelled “Phantom of the Opera” for his low-key appearances at Bayreuth by his wife’s side throughout her time in office.
Merkel’s reaction to a woman at the podium for the first time was a simple: “Finally!”
Lyniv, 43, from Ukraine, was previously principal conductor of Austria’s Graz Opera as well as a former assistant to the incumbent Berlin Philharmonic chief conductor, Kirill Petrenko, when he was at the Bavarian State Opera.
Katharina Wagner, the great-granddaughter of Richard Wagner and the festival’s outgoing director, said there had been few female conductors in the past to choose from, but that Lyniv represented a new generation “courageous enough” to learn to conduct.
Lyniv told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper what mattered to the orchestra was not her sex but her ability.
“The orchestra sees after three minutes whether you’re able to conduct or not … it notices immediately whether you can answer concrete musical questions, how your baton technique is and whether you’re capable of leading a hundred people without concern. If they can trust you on this basis, then the musicians are not in the least bit interested whether a man or a woman is conducting. Only the journalists do that.”
Asked why she thought conducting had remained a male domain for so long, Lyniv said: “It’s to do with the development of society. Up until well into the 80s there were still a few prominent orchestras that didn’t accept women as musicians. Women were also societally disadvantaged – just think about labour rights. But in the past five years, a lot has happened. The most important opera houses are making an effort to put on up to three productions led by women.”
The Bayreuth festival, which runs until 25 August, is taking place amid tight restrictions for cultural events in an effort to keep German coronavirus infection rates under control. This year, only about 900 audience members are allowed to attend each performance – half of the usual capacity. Seats are restricted to those who have been vaccinated, have recovered from the virus or have had a negative test."

An increasing number of European governments are planning to prevent unvaccinated people from being able to attend hospitality venues such as bars and restaurants this summer, as Emmanuel Macron celebrates the fruits of the recent announcement of the policy in France.
France on Monday passed the threshold of 40 million people having received at least one vaccine dose – close to 60% of the population. Macron tweeted: “Together we will defeat the virus. We continue!”
A range of policies are being tried out across Europe as governments seek to push reluctant people into receiving jabs. In Sweden, a study being carried out by the University of Lund will examine whether the offer of a redeemable voucher worth £17 can convince people to take the plunge. In the Netherlands, batches of Hollandse nieuwe, or new-season Dutch herring, are being distributed to vaccination centres as an incentive.
But by the far the most impressive results following a government intervention on vaccine uptake are being enjoyed in France, where record numbers have been administered in the two weeks since Macron announced his intention to legislate to limit access to hospitality to benefit those who are fully vaccinated, in possession of a negative PCR test or able to prove that they have recovered from infection.
An estimated 161,000 people had protested over the weekend as parliamentarians in Paris sought to find a compromise agreement on the so-called health pass. But it was passed at 12.45am on Monday after 60 hours of debate and a last-minute deal between the national assembly and the senate.
The new pass will be required to attend restaurants, bars, museums, cinemas and large public gatherings from August, but not shopping malls, after the government was pressured into dropping that aspect of the legislation. Local prefects will instead have the powers to impose the rule on large shopping centres if they feel it is necessary.
The pass will not be required for 12- to 17-year-olds until the end of September. Another compromise means health workers and restaurant and bar staff in France will not be sacked if they remain unvaccinated, but they can be suspended without pay.
In the past fortnight, 4m jabs have been administered in France with the health ministry reporting on Monday that 33.2 million people – close to 50% of the population – were fully vaccinated.
On Monday, Ireland allowed hospitality venues to reopen their indoor facilities to those customers holding the EU’s digital certificate that proves their vaccine status or a record from the country’s Health Service Executive.
From 6 August, a similar “green pass” will be required in Italy to access hospitality businesses, public swimming pools, gyms and sports halls, sports events, concerts, fairs and cultural venues such as museums, cinemas, and theatres.
There is no national policy in Spain but the region of Galicia is mandating a vaccination certificate or a negative Covid-19 test for indoor access to hotels and restaurants. In Belgium access to outdoor events with more than 1,500 people will be limited from 13 August to those carrying a vaccine certificate.
Boris Johnson has said he intends to limit access to nightclubs in England from September to those who can prove that they are fully vaccinated.
In Germany, politicians are in the thick of a debate over how and whether pressure to get jabbed should be increased on people who have yet to be vaccinated.
Just under half (49.4%) of Germans are fully jabbed and 61% have had one dose. But the vaccine campaign has slowed down over recent weeks, with reports of many having missed appointments for second jabs in order to go on holiday, leading experts to warn that herd immunity is nowhere near being reached.
At the weekend Helge Braun, the chief of staff of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, suggested those not vaccinated should not be directly penalised but that people who were should have distinct advantages.
He told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper unvaccinated people should be obliged to reduce their contacts, and that for them “visits to restaurants, cinemas and stadiums” should be restricted because of the high risk.
Wading into what is inevitably going to be a leading issue in the run-up to September’s federal election, Armin Laschet, the leading candidate for the Christian Democrats, spoke out against making vaccines obligatory.
“Obliging people to get a vaccine is not something I can go along with,” he said in a television interview. “And neither can I support the idea of indirectly pressurising people to get a jab.”

He said he might be prepared for a rethink if the number of vaccinated people remained low in the autumn.
Meanwhile, Markus Söder, the leader of Bavaria, suggested increasing pressure on unvaccinated people by obliging them to pay for tests to prove their Covid status, which are currently free.
Karl Lauterbach, the health spokesperson for the Social Democrats, said due to an infection rate that has been rising for the last three weeks, by autumn it will no longer be possible to avoid “limiting access to spaces where lots of people come together, to those who are either recovered or vaccinated”, becaue of the high level of false negative test results."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/22/angela-merkel-bowing-out-the-chancellor-who-balances-bundestag-with-bunsen-burner;2021-07-22;Merkel’s political and scientific sides slug it out in swan song presser;"Always the diplomatic politician, forever the objective scientist, Germany’s chancellor gives her last annual summer press do
As she faced a lecture-hall sized auditorium packed with national and international press for the last time in her 16-year chancellorship, there was a sense that the room was simultaneously hearing from two very different people in Angela Merkel.
One was Merkel the politician, unafraid to talk up her achievements, who patted herself on the back for diplomatic victories and expertly fudged answers to difficult questions. The other was Merkel the scientist, who found it hard to skirt around uncomfortable truths and instinctively wanted to scrutinise her doppelgänger’s track record.
Merkel’s training as a quantum chemist has always set her apart from the male lawyers, economists and journalists who held the highest office in German politics before her – as she did not fail to remind her audience on Thursday morning at the last of her annual summer press conferences before she steps down in two months’ time.
At best, the scientific background has made Merkel a politician with an unusually high awareness of there being an objective reality which political language can at best imitate but rarely touch.
One of the recent trends in western democracies that most worried her, she said, was a social media-fuelled “mixing of feelings and facts”, a phenomenon she felt had the potential to unroll the achievements of the Enlightenment. “These are two separate categories: feelings are feelings, and facts are facts.”
Her inability to let politics descend to sloganeering is striking, even more so when compared with certain British prime ministers.
Asked whether there had been distinctly feminine quality in her leadership, Merkel the politician briefly smelled a catchy line. “On balance, women have a certain yearning for efficiency.”
But even as her quip triggered sniggers around the room, Merkel the scientist began rowing back, imagining the headlines in horror: you could not generalise about male and female behaviour as such, she clarified, women were more different then they were alike.
At her worst, as when she turned to the subject of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Germany and Russia, Merkel speaks like a scientist about what are political decisions, presenting choices as inevitable procedures.
The deal with the US, which commits Germany to sanction Russia if it tries to use energy supplies as geopolitical leverage but enables completion of the gas pipeline, was “a good step that does not overcome all divergences”, Merkel said, making it sound like a conflict resolution workshop rather than a concrete project that places Germany’s industrial interests over the concerns of its eastern European and Baltic neighbours.
Yet on climate change, the subject arguably set to dominate her last two months in office, Merkel the scientist is making herself heard against Merkel the politician more loudly than usual.
“Germany has done a lot,” she said, championing the expansion of renewable energy and reduction of carbon emissions under her watch.
But the scientist would not let her finish. Measured against the target to limit global warming to well below 2C, preferably to 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels, she said: “What has been achieved is not sufficient.”
Then as a politician she added: “I am of the opinion that I have invested a lot of energy in climate protection.” The scientist continued: “And nonetheless I am equipped with sufficient sense for science to see that objective circumstances demand that we can’t continue at the current pace but have to up the tempo.”
A true political animal would have used her last big press conference to champion the designated successor who will carry on her legacy, or verbally sabotage his competitors. Yet Merkel indirectly distanced herself from Armin Laschet, the new leader of her Christian Democratic Union, when she insisted that overall rates of new Covid-19 infections should still play a central role when it came to considering pandemic restrictions; Laschet wants the occupancy of intensive care beds to become a more important indicator.
When one journalist suggested that her possible successor had neither understood the challenge of the climate crisis nor the mechanics behind the pandemic growth, Merkel replied without using Laschet’s name. “I think everyone has understood by now how exponential growth works.” It sounded like the opposite of an enthusiastic endorsement."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/22/merkel-germany-not-done-enough-hit-paris-climate-target;2021-07-22;Merkel: Germany has not done enough to hit Paris climate targets;"Chancellor says record on reducing carbon emissions ‘not sufficient’ as she reflects on 16-year leadership
Angela Merkel has conceded Germany’s record on reducing carbon emissions was “not sufficient” to meet the global warming targets of the Paris climate agreement, as the chancellor reflected on the achievements and missed opportunities of her 16-year leadership.
Speaking at the last of her annual summer press conferences on Thursday before stepping down as leader of Europe’s largest economy after federal elections on 26 September, Merkel said Germany “has done a lot” to recalibrate its economy in the face of the climate crisis, increasing the share of renewables in its energy mix from 10% to 40%, and lowering carbon emission by 20% in the period from 1990 to 2010, and by another 20% in the 10 years since.
The 67-year-old nonetheless conceded that “what has been achieved is not sufficient” when measured against the Paris agreement’s target to limit global warming to well below 2C, preferably to 1.5C, compared with pre-industrial levels. Not just Germany, but the whole world had failed to meet its targets, she said.
“I am equipped with sufficient sense for science to see that objective circumstances demand that we can’t continue at the current pace but have to up the tempo,” Merkel said.
While Germany alone could not change the world climate, she argued, “the manner in which we do it can set an example that others follow”.
Merkel, who was environment minister under Chancellor Helmut Kohl from 1994 to 1998, said the fight for joint global steps towards more efficient climate protection had “shaped my entire political work”.
She defended her government’s 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022, which critics say has made the country more reliant on coal power. “For Germany, the die has been cast,” she said. “I don’t see a government of the future changing anything in that respect.”
The issue of the climate emergency has returned to the top of the political agenda after record rainfall and flash floods last week devastated large parts of western Germany, killing at least 179 people and leaving transport and energy infrastructure in parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and North-Rhine Westphalia in disarray.
Germany’s national weather service said on Thursday that regions hit by the floods last week could receive more heavy rain at the weekend.
Merkel said the effort to rebuild houses, railways and energy lines in the flooded region would be a monumental undertaking that would require her efforts “until the last day” of her chancellorship.
On Wednesday her cabinet approved emergency financial aid worth €200m (£170m) for people affected by flooding, with state governments expected to match the federal aid programme.
More than 4,500 civil defence workers, firefighters and soldiers have been deployed to help with cleanup efforts in the badly affected Ahr valley region of Rhineland-Palatinate.
Merkel said the extent of the damage had yet to be determined “but it is immense”.
At the start of the wide-ranging one-and-a-half hour press conference, Merkel also expressed her concern about the “worrying dynamic” of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany, saying the Delta variant was driving another wave of “exponential growth” despite 60% of the German population having received at least one shot of vaccine.
Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, on Thursday registered 1,890 new infections over the past 24 hours and an incidence rate of 12.2 new cases per 100,000 people over the last week, up from a low of 4.9 in early July."
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-floods-another-wake-up-call;2021-07-19;The Guardian view on Germany’s floods: another wake-up call;"The lethal destruction in western states will frame the debate ahead of September’s vital election
Earlier this month, the German Greens unveiled an election poster designed to reassure voters who might be wary of their environmental radicalism. “Economy and climate without crisis”, went its slogan, suggesting that ambitious carbon reduction targets could be met without undue pain for jobs and industry. Days later, ecological crisis struck, in the form of the devastating floods that have overwhelmed western Germany, and parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. More than 190 people are so far known to have died, following flooding of an intensity and scale that has shocked scientists. The record levels of rain in north-west Europe followed record-breaking heat in the Americas. Extreme weather events are becoming the new normal, as climate models have long predicted. But some of the recent spikes have outstripped scientific predictions.
The eventual impact of the floods on Germany’s September election remains to be seen. But this disaster, which the country’s main political parties have broadly agreed was related to global warming, has thrust the climate crisis to the forefront of the campaign. On Sunday, Angela Merkel, who is standing down as chancellor, insisted that Germany needed to “up the pace in the fight against climate change”. Less impressively, the conservative frontrunner to succeed her, Armin Laschet, was caught on video sharing jokes with bystanders during a visit to a flooded town. As the president of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the worst-hit states, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union can make amends by getting to the bottom of a lethal failure to translate satellite warnings into evacuations on the ground.
Anguished debate in Germany is understandably focused on why, given the increased frequency of flooding as a result of the climate crisis, more efficient early warning systems were not in place. But the floods also underline the vital longer-term importance of September’s poll. Germany is Europe’s most powerful and influential state. As nations face up to the hard choices involved in meeting ambitious net zero targets, the timing and context means that the post-Merkel election will be a bellwether for green political hopes throughout Europe and beyond.
Having briefly led in polls during May, Germany’s Greens have endured a difficult few weeks. The party’s candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, has suffered a series of political embarrassments, including allegations of plagiarism and overembellishing her CV. Though they remain on course to finish second to the CDU, the Greens have so far failed to seize the moment to make the case for a step change in levels of green investment in Germany, and at EU level. Meanwhile, the CDU’s manifesto, published last month, shows little sign of the economic radicalism necessary to deal with the climate emergency. Instead, Mr Laschet seeks to restore Germany’s constitutional debt brake as part of a post-pandemic return to fiscal conservatism. The stakes of this debate are enormous. As well as learning to cope and adjust to extreme weather events linked to global heating, there is a need to treat them as a warning of even worse to come if the world does not properly invest in a green future. In the autumn, Germany has an opportunity to give a lead."

Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany must up its pace in tackling the impact of the climate crisis, after more flash floods devastated towns in eastern Germany, Bavaria and Austria over the weekend.
While one flood in itself was not an indicator of the climate crisis, Merkel said during a visit to one of the two regions in western Germany hardest hit by last week’s record rainfall, the number of such extreme weather events had increased in recent years.
“We have to up the pace in the fight against climate change,” the German leader said.
The Alpine district of Berchtesgadener Land became the latest region to be affected by floods on Saturday evening, after heavy rainfall led to flooded streets and landslides, leaving at least one person dead.
Across the border in Austria, a brook swollen with rainwater flooded the historic centre of the town of Hallein, south of Salzburg, trapping residents in their buildings, upending cars and inundating ground-floor shops. The town’s mayor, Alexander Stangassinger, told the broadcaster ORF the floods had caused damage worth millions of euros.
Several towns in the hilly eastern German region of Saxon Switzerland, south-east of Dresden, were also cut off and train services to the Czech Republic disrupted. Rainfall in the catchment basin of the Kirnitzsch, Polenz, Sebnitz and Wesenitz tributaries exceeded 100 litres per sq metre over the course of 24 hours, authorities reported, leading the waters to break the rivers’ banks.
Intense rainfall last week claimed the lives of at least 184 people in western Europe. On Wednesday and Thursday, a near-stationary low-pressure weather system over parts of western Germany brought intense rainfall and floods, with 110 people killed in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, a further 45 in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and at least 27 in neighbouring Belgium. At least 670 people were injured.
Germany’s main provider of public railway services, Deutsche Bahn, said the storms and floods had caused damage to over 80 of its stations and more than 600km of tracks.
During her visit to the affected areas in western Germany, Merkel on Sunday described a “surreal, ghostly situation” in the village of Schuld in Rhineland-Palatinate state, where floods had ripped through buildings, washed away cars and trapped people in their homes.
“The German language barely has words for the devastation that has been wrought here,” Merkel said during her joint visit with Malu Dreyer, the state premier.
She pledged quick financial aid to the region and vowed to return to Schuld in August. Her finance minister, Social Democrat chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz, on Sunday promised at least €300m (£257m) to the victims of the natural disaster.
“Germany is a strong country,” Merkel said. “We will stand up to this force of nature, in the short term, but also in the medium and long term.”
The floods have hit Germany two months before federal elections that will determine a successor to Merkel, who is stepping down after 16 years in office.
The conservative frontrunner to step into her shoes, Armin Laschet, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Thursday interrupted a party meeting to attend flood-hit areas in NRW, the populous western state he represents as premier.
While visiting the devastated town of Erftstadt, where an eroded gravel quarry had swallowed cars, bits of road and entire buildings, Laschet was on Saturday caught sharing jokes with bystanders while the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, solemnly addressed the cameras.
Lars Klingbeil, the general secretary of the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), called Laschet’s behaviour “lacking in decency and appalling”. The broadcaster WDR commented that every election campaign offered a few moments “in which the candidates show their true colours”, adding: “Today is such a moment.”
Laschet tweeted an apology on Saturday afternoon. “The fate of those affected, which we heard about in many conversations, is important to us,” he wrote. “So I regret all the more the impression that arose from a conversational situation. That was inappropriate and I am sorry.”
The Green party’s candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, who has struggled to centre the national conversation around ecological issues after a strong start to her campaign, cut short her holiday to visit affected areas but declined to be accompanied by the press.
Mass tabloid Bild, which makes no secret of its distaste for the idea of a Green victory in September, warned against “politicising” the floods. “What no one needs right now is a stupid, ideological blame game and campaign soundbites that instrumentalise the brute force of nature for political ends,” wrote Bild’s editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt in a comment piece. “You overcome catastrophes through unity, not division.”
By contrast, the regional public broadcaster in the affected parts of Germany, WDR, said it was inevitable that the floods will take centre stage as the country’s election campaign enters its hot phase. “Weather is highly political, there is barely such a thing as apolitical weather.”
A high pressure system over Britain and Ireland is promising to alleviate concerns about further rainfall by bringing dry and sunny summer weather to Germany in the coming week, the German Meteorological Service announced on Sunday. The weekend could see a return of stormy weather in Germany’s south-west, however."

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/16/western-germany-floods-angela-merkel-horror-catastrophe-deaths-missing-search-flooding-belgium;2021-07-18;Death toll exceeds 180 as Germany and Belgium hit by devastating floods;"Search for missing continues, with Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg also affected
The death toll from catastrophic floods in western Germany and Belgium has risen to more than 180, as emergency services continued their search for hundreds still missing.
The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said he was “stunned” by the devastation caused by the flooding and pledged support to the families of those killed and to cities and towns facing significant damage. It is Germany’s worst natural disaster in more than half a century.
“In the hour of need, our country stands together,” Steinmeier said on Friday afternoon. “It’s important that we show solidarity for those from whom the flood has taken everything.”
Authorities in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate said that 110 people had died there, including at least 12 residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities, while neighbouring North Rhine-Westphalia put the death toll at 43. One person died in Berchtesgadener Land, a spokeswoman for the Bavarian district told Agence France-Presse.
Officials warned the figures could rise further. Many people in the Ahrweiler district of Rhineland-Palatinate remain unaccounted for, although efforts to contact them were being hindered by damage to phone networks.
Experts said the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) issued an extreme flood warning earlier this week and questioned why the toll was so high. Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist, told Politico the disaster was “a monumental failure of the system”.
The German weather service DWD said it had passed on the warning to local authorities, who should have been responsible for organising any necessary evacuations. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Germany “must prepare much better” in future, adding that “this is a consequence of climate change”.
Steinmeier called for greater efforts to combat global warming. “Only if we decisively take up the fight against climate change will we be able to limit the extreme weather conditions we are now experiencing,” he said.
Experts said such disasters were likely to happen more often due to climate change. “Some parts of western Europe …… received up to two months of rainfall in the space of two days,” World Meteorological Organization spokesperson Clare Nullis said.
While she said it was too soon to blame the floods and preceding heatwave on global heating, Nullis said the climate crisis was “increasing the frequency of extreme events while many single events have been shown to be made worse by global warming.”
Belgium’s death toll has risen to 27 , with another 20 still missing. Most of the dead were found around Liège, a city of 200,000 people, despite an order for residents of central districts and areas bordering the Meuse River to evacuate.
Verlinden said water levels on the Meuse running into the Netherlands remained critical. “There are a number of dikes on the Meuse where it is really touch and go whether they will collapse,” she said.
The army has been sent to four of the country’s 10 provinces to help with rescue operations and evacuations, along with teams of emergency workers dispatched from Italy and France. Residents of some towns, including the resort of Spa, which has been under water since late on Wednesday, were being accommodated in tents.
While they have so far suffered no loss of life, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also severely affected, with flash floods sweeping through the Swiss villages of Schleitheim and Beggingen, several towns in the Grand Duchy evacuated on Thursday, and thousands told to leave their homes in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht.
The water level in the Maas, as the Meuse is known in Dutch, reached its maximum forecast height in Maastricht on Thursday night but stayed below what authorities had termed the “doom scenario”, averting widespread flooding.
At least 550 households were evacuated in Roermond, while authorities in Venlo evacuated about 200 hospital patients due to the looming threat of flooding from the river. The caretaker prime minister, Mark Rutte, formally declared a disaster, freeing up state funds to pay for the damage.
By far the highest death toll was in Germany, where 114,000 households were without power and rescuers on Friday were focusing their efforts on helping people trapped in their homes in the town of Erftstadt, south-west of Cologne.
Regional authorities said several people had died or been reported missing after their houses collapsed when the ground beneath them sank suddenly in a major landslide. Aerial photos showed what appeared to be a massive sinkhole.
“We managed to get 50 people out of their houses last night,” Frank Rock, a local official, said. “We know of 15 people who still need to be rescued … One has to assume that, under the circumstances, some people didn’t manage to escape.”
Roads around Erftstadt were impassable, with rescue crews trying to reach residents by boat and having to rely on walkie-talkies to communicate. “The mobile network has collapsed. The infrastructure has collapsed. Hospitals can’t take anyone in. Nursing homes had to be evacuated,” a regional government spokesperson in Cologne said.
More rain was forecast for parts of the region, where water levels in the Rhine and its tributaries continued to rise. Nearly 1,000 soldiers have been deployed to help with rescue operations and rubble-clearing in affected towns and villages.
At least 24 people were confirmed dead in Euskirchen, one of the worst-hit towns. Reporters on the scene described a normally well-ordered centre transformed into a mountain of rubble and house fronts ripped off by the floods.
Thousands of people remain homeless after their houses were destroyed or deemed at-risk by authorities, including several villages around the Steinbach reservoir that experts say could collapse under the weight of the floods.
“I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said late on Thursday in Washington, where she is visiting Joe Biden, calling it a day “characterised by fear, despair, suffering”.
She said her government would not leave those affected “alone with their suffering,” adding that it was doing its “utmost to help them in their distress”.
The conservative governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, who is running to succeed Merkel as chancellor in elections due in September, called an emergency cabinet meeting for Friday.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he would propose a package of immediate aid at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that it would cost more than €300m (US$354m). A rebuilding program was also needed, he said, and would cost in the billions of euros.
“It is a reality that extreme weather events will influence our everyday life more strongly in the future,” Laschet said, adding: “We have to continue down Germany’s path towards climate neutrality at a faster pace.”
But he also said that the problems caused by the climate crisis “cannot be solved in North-Rhine Westphalia, or Germany”. Malu Dreyer, the governor of Rhineland-Palatinate, said climate change was “not abstract any more. We are experiencing it up close and painfully.”"

Joe Biden hosted Angela Merkel at the White House on Thursday for bilateral meetings as the outgoing German chancellor prepares to step down, in a visit that marked Biden’s latest attempt to strengthen relationships with US allies.
The two leaders met in the Oval Office and later held a joint press conference. Biden and Merkel vowed to work together to defend against Russian aggression and stand up to anti-democratic actions by China, and also spoke to the importance of the US-German alliance.
Biden said he had also reiterated his concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major, nearly complete pipeline that will run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, but he and Merkel were united in their belief that Russia should not use energy as a weapon.
“We stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our eastern flank allies at Nato against Russian aggression,” Biden said during their joint news conference.
He said both countries would stand up for democratic principles and universal rights when they saw China or any other country working to undermine a free and open society.
The president also said he and Merkel discussed the ongoing pandemic travel restrictions, and when it will be safe to lift the ban on travel from Europe to the US.
“It’s in the process now. And I’ll be able to answer that question to you within the next several days, what is likely to happen,” Biden said, adding that he had asked his administration’s coronavirus team to assess when the restrictions should be lifted.
Biden used the briefing to pay tribute to the German leader, as she nears the end of a political career that has spanned four American presidencies. “On a personal note, I must tell you I will miss seeing you at our summits,” Biden said as he stood by Merkel, the second-longest serving chancellor in Germany’s history. “I truly will.”
Merkel’s visit underscored Biden’s efforts to strengthen US alliances, after four years of Donald Trump’s divisive leadership. Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, have known and worked with each other for years, and see eye to eye on a string of broader matters. Both leaders want to strengthen the transatlantic relationship that suffered under the former president’s frequent, withering criticism of close US allies, and vowed to do so going forward.
“The cooperation between the United States and Germany is strong and we hope to continue that, and I’m confident that we will,” Biden said as they began an Oval Office meeting that lasted well over an hour.
“I value the friendship,” said Merkel, the first European leader to visit Biden at the White House, highlighting America’s role in building a free and democratic Germany after the second world war.
Merkel started her day with a working breakfast with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and Harris’ office said the two had a “very candid discussion”.
But personal warmth notwithstanding, the US-German relationship is now at a pivot point as Merkel, who is not seeking another term in September elections, nears her departure from office. The two leaders do not have much time to work together to strengthen ties between the world’s largest and fourth-largest economies, and there are concerns on both sides about how the two nations will negotiate growing disagreements.
The United States has long argued that the Nord Stream 2 project will threaten European energy security by increasing the continent’s reliance on Russian gas and allowing Russia to exert political pressure on vulnerable eastern and central European nations, particularly Ukraine. But Biden recently waived sanctions against German entities involved in the project, a move that angered many in Congress.
Merkel sought to downplay the differences, and to stress that the pipeline was in addition to – and not meant to displace – Ukraine pipelines.
Germany and the United States also disagree over the wisdom of partnering with China on business projects, temporary patent waivers aimed at speeding global Covid-19 vaccine production and ongoing restrictions on Europeans traveling to the United States.
On Thursday evening, Merkel and her husband will attend a dinner hosted by the Bidens at the White House. Guests include US lawmakers, former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton and the Republican leaders of the US House of Representatives and Senate, the White House said.
Back home, Germany and neighboring Belgium dealt with the aftermath of heavy flooding that left more than 30 people dead and dozens missing. “My sympathy goes to the relatives and of the dead and missing,” Merkel said during the press briefing."

At least 58 people have died and dozens more are missing in Germany after much of western Europe was inundated by record rainfall that brought devastating floods.
“Climate change has arrived in Germany,” the environment minister said, as the country reeled from the sight of destroyed buildings, upended cars and people stranded on rooftops.
Weather experts said rain in the region over the past 24 hours had been unprecedented, as a near-stationary low-pressure weather system also caused sustained local downpours to the west in France, the Netherlands and Belgium where media reported that eight people had died.
Angela Merkel expressed shock at the scope of the flooding. “I grieve for those who have lost their lives in this disaster,” the German chancellor said during a visit to Washington DC. “We still don’t know the number. But it will be many.”
Everything would be done to find those still missing, she said, adding that “‘heavy rain and flooding’ doesn’t capture what happened”.
In the town of Schuld in the Eifel mountains 70 people were reported missing after several houses collapsed overnight.
“It was catastrophic,” said 65-year-old Edgar Gillessen, whose family home was damaged. “All these people living here, I know them all. I feel so sorry for them, they’ve lost everything,” he told Reuters. “A friend had a workshop over there, nothing standing, the bakery, the butcher, it’s all gone. It’s scary. Unimaginable.”
Across Rhineland-Palatinate state 28 deaths were confirmed by the evening. “There are dead people, there are missing people, and many who are still in danger,” said the state premier, Malu Dreyer. “We have never seen a catastrophe like this,” the Social Democrat politician added. “It is truly devastating.”
The full extent of the damage in the region was still unclear after many villages were cut off by flood water and landslides that made roads impassable. Videos posted on social media showed cars floating down streets and houses partly collapsed.
In the neighbouring western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, at least 30 people died, including two firefighters who drowned during rescue missions.
In at least four separate incidents, in the cities of Cologne, Solingen and Unna, people died after being trapped by the floods in their cellars. In Leverkusen, a hospital with 468 patients had to be evacuated overnight following a power failure, after the Dhünn River breached its banks.
As Germans prepare to go to the polls in September to choose a successor to Merkel, the extreme weather could heighten awareness of global heating, a topic with which the Greens, running second to Merkel’s conservatives, have so far failed to dominate the agenda.
“Climate change has arrived in Germany,” said the environment minister, Svenja Schulze. “The events show with what force the consequences of climate change can affect us all, and how important it is for us to adjust to extreme weather events in the future.”
On national broadcaster ZDF, the news anchor Claus Kleber pointed out that low-pressure areas were nothing new in the region. “But the fact that they are becoming more common has to do with the Arctic and the air above it getting warmer and weakening the jet stream,” Kleber said. “Therefore it has to do with climate change.”
Annalena Baerbock, the German Greens’ co-leader and candidate for chancellor, returned from her holidays to attend the situation, but did not immediately make the connection between the floods and the climate crisis.
“The destructive extent of the floods is shocking,” Baerbock said. “My thoughts and sympathies are with the people who mourn for loved ones, worry about the missing and look after those carrying injuries.”
Bernd Mehlig, an environment official from North Rhine-Westphalia, told WDR the situation being experienced by the state was ordinarily only seen in winter. “Something like this, with this intensity, is completely unusual in summer,” he said.
According to the energy network operator Westnetz, 200,000 people were affected by power outages in the two western states.
The army was deployed across North-Rhine Westphalia to help stranded residents, and rail, road and river transport has been disrupted in the country’s most populous state.
The weather system brought down 148 litres of rain per square metre within 48 hours to a part of Germany that usually receives 80 litres in the month.
The German weather service issued an extreme weather warning for parts of three western states, while Hagen, a city of 180,000, declared a state of emergency after the Volme River burst its banks.
Hagen’s crisis team said water would reach levels seen not more than four times a century in coming hours and warned everyone who lived near the town’s rivers to move to higher ground immediately, public broadcaster WDR reported.
Parts of Hagen were described as being isolated by high waters and all but inaccessible. Soldiers had to be sent to clear some areas of the city. Residents were also told to leave one district of the regional capital Düsseldorf.
One care home in Hagen had to be evacuated, while across the region firefighters were busy pumping water out of hundreds of cellars. In one hospital, flood waters caused lifts to fail.
A firefighter died when he lost his footing in flood waters and was swept away, authorities told WDR. Two men, aged 53 and 81, were missing elsewhere in the region.
Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and the conservatives’ candidate to succeed Merkel, cancelled a party meeting in Bavaria to return to his home region on Thursday, where praised the work of the rescue services.
Across the border in Belgium, the Vesdre River broke its banks and sent masses of water churning through the streets of Pepinster, close to Liège. A rescue operation by firefighters went wrong when a small boat capsized and three elderly people disappeared. “Unfortunately, they were quickly engulfed,” said the mayor, Philippe Godin. “I fear they are dead.”
In eastern Eupen, on the German border, one man was reported dead after he was swept away by a torrent. Another man was reported missing in eastern Belgium.
Thousands of people in the south of the Netherlands were urged to leave their houses quickly to escape floods as rivers were on the brink of bursting their banks.
Several towns and villages along the Meuse river in the province of Limburg strongly advised people to seek refuge until at least Friday afternoon, as there was a large chance that their home would be flooded in the coming hours.
Water levels on the Meuse and the Rur reached record levels on Thursday. In Valkenburg, in the far south of Limburg, close to the Belgian and German border, floods had already engulfed the town centre, forcing the evacuation of several nursing homes and destroying at least one bridge.
Germany’s weather service on Thursday warned of further heavy rain in Wuppertal and the Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis region.

Angela Merkel, now on an affable UK farewell tour including tea with the Queen, leaves a paradoxical legacy for many British.
She is often hailed as the upholder of a liberal Europe that faced a populist onslaught from Donald Trump. But she is also the woman who refused to throw David Cameron a lifeline on immigration ahead of the Brexit referendum, judging it not in the national interest. But for Merkel’s stance then, her jocular host now might not have been Boris Johnson, who leaves her cold, but an ageing Cameron in his 11th year in office.
Cameron liked her, describing the east German as an Anglophile who admired British science and democracy from the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. She was the best-briefed person in the room, he recalled, capable of working out in advance other people’s negotiating needs and strategies.
Not that Cameron in his autobiography begrudges Merkel’s unwillingness to concede more on the free movement of EU workers. He largely blames himself in not selling a deal that could have given the UK a comfortable future in the EU.
Sir Paul Lever, the former British ambassador to Berlin in the six years to 2003, said Berlin weighed the odds of Britain’s importance to the EU, and the euro: “Berlin’s judgement of the price the EU should pay to keep the UK in the EU reflected their assessment of the value of continued British membership.”
That does not mean there was no emotional side to Germany’s attachment to British membership of the EU, not least as a free-trading, liberal counterweight to France’s more protectionist tendencies. Asked how Germany would react if the UK left the EU, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, replied: “We will cry.”
As a woman of famously pragmatic temperament, one suspects Merkel dabbed her eyes relatively quickly after the referendum result before asking: “What’s next?”
Indeed, within a year, Merkel gave the go-ahead for her diplomats to start negotiating a bilateral agreement with the UK on continued cooperation with Germany on defence and foreign policy. That joint declaration got shelved during the bitter Brexit talks, and if relations had truly soured over the Northern Ireland protocol or vaccine nationalism, it might have died completely.
But the current German ambassador to London, Andreas Michaelis, has been an assiduous advocate of greater cooperation and helped revive the initiative, leading to its publication this week.
Much of it is non-controversial, but it was striking that London and Berlin could find consensual words on Nato, Iran, the Indo-Pacific, future relations with Putin, and the balance between the pursuit of trade and human rights. Both cabinets will now meet once a year, giving a focal point for ministers to think about the relationship.
Johnson even signed up to an affirmation of European unity, something the Germans prize, since they do not want bilateral cooperation with the UK to be seen as a way for the UK to weaken EU foreign policy, or make smaller EU states feel sidelined.
But Merkel will be gone by the end of September, leaving a hole in European politics. The 90-minute foreign policy debate between the candidates to be her successor hosted last week by the Munich Security Conference showed how Brexit is part of the past. The European issue gripping German politicians is relations with Joe Biden and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, not Britain. True, if the Greens make it into government, perhaps via a traffic light coalition, there will be a sharper edge to German foreign policy on arms exports, human rights and relations with autocratic powers. But it is the German-French motor that will drive Europe from now on. The UK has chosen a detachable sidecar."

British travellers who have had two Covid vaccines may soon be allowed quarantine-free entry into Germany, Angela Merkel has said, as Boris Johnson sought to smooth over post-Brexit tensions by declaring: “The wurst is over.”
Speaking on her final trip to the UK before stepping down from the role she has held since 2005, the German chancellor said she only put tougher border restrictions in force for people coming from Britain because of uncertainty about the Delta variant.
While the variant was “increasing very rapidly” in Germany, Merkel said, changes would be made in the “foreseeable future” to let people who have been double-jabbed into the country without the need to isolate.
The announcement, made at a press conference alongside Johnson at Chequers on Friday, was welcomed by the prime minister as “great” news.
Merkel had last week urged other EU nations to impose tougher travel restrictions due to a significant spread of the Delta variant in England, which ballooned after ministers delayed putting India on the red list.
The chancellor was more positive on Friday, saying “in the beginning we didn’t have that much experience with this variant” but that Berlin and all other countries’ governments would “adjust time and again to the most recent developments”.
Germany is on the UK’s amber list, meaning anyone arriving from there must quarantine at home for 10 days, but can be released on day six if they test negative. Ministers have said the isolation requirement for British travellers who are fully inoculated when they return from amber countries will be dropped – probably from the start of August.
Merkel was also buoyant about the possibility of changes to the Northern Ireland protocol – a key part of the Brexit deal that imposed checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea – saying “pragmatic solutions” could be found.
An extension to grace periods allowing businesses to forgo checks on chilled meats was agreed last month, leading Johnson to declare on Friday that “the wurst is behind us”.
He admitted there were still “a lot of issues to be solved” but insisted: “I’m sure, with goodwill and patience, we can sort it out.”
Despite their united front, Merkel appeared uneasy about the size of crowds allowed to gather for Euro 2020 football matches. She said she had “grave concern” about the potential spread of Covid and that while it was up to the British government to make its own decisions, “I’m very much concerned whether it’s not a bit too much.”
Johnson insisted he was confident the final phase of unlocking meant to take place on 21 June but delayed by four weeks would go ahead on 19 July, saying vaccines had helped build up a “wall of immunity” and that there was a “great degree of resistance to the virus in the UK population”.
Addressing concern that the EU’s vaccine passport system does not recognise AstraZeneca vaccines produced by the Serum Institute in India, Johnson said he saw no reason why they should not be accepted. “I’m very confident that that will not prove to be a problem,” he said.
During their socially distanced press conference, to which only four journalists were invited to ask questions, Merkel also reflected on her relationship with Johnson – a tricky one given their many disagreements over Brexit.
The German chancellor said cooperation with her British counterpart had gone “very, very well”, though she added: “We look at each other, we look at how different people can be and then we make the best of it.”
As one of the world’s longest-serving elected political leaders, Merkel has worked with five UK prime ministers: Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson.
Merkel said she “really liked all” of them and their different personalities, and vowed to “continue to cooperate very well” with Johnson “in the time remaining to me”."

Boris Johnson is to welcome Angela Merkel to Chequers on Friday, with coronavirus travel restrictions anticipated to be high on the agenda for their meeting.The German chancellor, who is making her final visit to the UK before stepping down, has called for quarantine for all UK travellers entering the EU, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, due to concerns over the Delta variant.
Germany has already designated the UK a “virus variant region”, meaning anyone travelling from the UK has to quarantine for two weeks on arrival – excluding those in transit.
Since March, all travellers flying to Germany have had to present a negative Covid-19 test to their airline prior to departure.However, the UK government is pushing for greater freedom for Britons to travel. It has said fully vaccinated Britons will be able to travel to amber list countries including Germany, without having to quarantine upon their return, from “later this summer”.
The meeting comes after the prime minister said on Thursday that double jabs will be “a liberator” for those in Britain wanting to travel abroad this summer.
Johnson said details of the government’s plans for allowing those who have received two vaccine doses to visit amber-list countries without having to quarantine on their return and lockdown easing later this month will be revealed in the “next few days”.
He would not confirm a date on when such a policy would be implemented, but said he was “very confident” that it would “enable people to travel”.
Merkel is expected to address a virtual meeting of the British cabinet as part of the visit, while the two leaders are set to discuss post-Brexit relations between London and Berlin.Johnson said: “The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues.
“Our scientists, innovators and industrialists work together every day to make the world a better place.
“Over the 16 years of Chancellor Merkel’s tenure, the UK-Germany relationship has been re-energised and reinvigorated for a new era.
“And the new joint ventures we will agree today [Friday] will leave a legacy that will last for generations.”
The two leaders last met at the G7 summit in Cornwall last month.
Merkel is set to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle on Friday as part of her visit, which will be her 22nd since taking office in 2005."

A Franco-German plan to restart talks with Vladimir Putin has been rejected at a fractious EU summit that resulted in a decision to explore economic sanctions against Russia instead.
The two-day gathering in Brussels also included an “emotional” debate over LGBT rights in Hungary, as EU leaders confronted Viktor Orbán over a law that will ban gay people from being shown in educational and entertainment content for minors.
The two issues made what was meant to be a routine summit of the 27 EU leaders into a much more bruising encounter. Tensions were raised after France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel blindsided other leaders by proposing talks with Putin, following Joe Biden’s summit with the Russian president last week.
The move backfired, with Poland and the Baltic states leading the charge, arguing that talking to Putin was a concession that would not change the Kremlin’s behaviour. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said it was like trying “to engage the bear to keep a pot of honey safe”.
Merkel, attending what is likely to be her last Brussels summit as a sitting head of government, said it had not been an easy discussion on Russia. “Personally I would have liked to have taken a bolder step here,” she told reporters after the meeting finished in the small hours of Friday morning. “But it’s also good as it is, and we will continue to work on this.”
She challenged the view – held by Baltic countries – that a summit with Putin amounted to a reward that sat ill with Russia’s annexation of Crimea and backing for separatists in eastern Ukraine, saying the EU should not rely on the US to conduct face-to-face talks with the Russian president.
“It’s not sufficient … that we are simply satisfied with a debrief by the president of the United States,” she said, casting the issue as one of sovereignty. “I think we should be independent enough to have our own position.”
Macron said it was “no tragedy” the union had failed to find consensus for a summit with Putin. “The most important thing is to remain united,” he said, adding: “I’ll be frank, I don’t need an EU summit to see Vladimir Putin. I saw him several times as president and I’ll continue to see him.”
The last EU-Russia summit took place in January 2014, shortly before Russia’s annexation of Crimea triggered EU sanctions, putting relations on a downward slide.
Instead of talks with Putin, the EU27 toughened their approach: in the final summit communique, EU leaders stressed “the need for a firm and coordinated response by the EU and its member states to any further malign, illegal and disruptive activity by Russia, making full use of all instruments at the EU’s disposal”. The leaders tasked the EU institutions “to present options for additional restrictive measures including economic sanctions”.
The Russia debate came after EU leaders confronted Orbán over LGBT rights in Hungary, in what one official described as an “emotional” debate. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who has clashed with Orbán over the rule of law in previous summits, made his feelings plain as he arrived at the summit: “For me, Hungary has no place in the EU any more.”
António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said: “You can’t be a member of the European Union if you don’t accept and respect the values that we have in the European Union. No one is a member of the European Union because they are forced to [be].”
But the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, rejected the idea that Hungary should leave the EU: “In Hungary there are 10 million people and I am firmly convinced that there are 10 million good reasons for Hungary to be and remain part of the European Union.”
Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, the first EU leader to be married to a same-sex partner, said Orbán had crossed a red line. “I did not become gay. I am, it is not a choice,” he was reported to have said according to a diplomatic source. “Some years ago we had dinner in Budapest together with my husband. I don’t recognise you [Orbán] any more.”
Defying his critics, the Hungarian leader rejected all charges of homophobia and said the law was meant to ensure parents had the choice over how to educate their children. Before the summit, Orbán said EU leaders had not read the Hungarian law and claimed he was “defending the rights of the homosexual guys”.
Leaving the summit, Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, who wore a rainbow pin in his lapel, described the discussion as “unprecedented”. “This was not a diplomatic discussion, this was quite confrontational,” he said.
Only Poland and Slovenia – the latter “a little bit” – had offered Hungary support, De Croo said.
Von der Leyen instructed her staff to issue a formal warning letter to the Hungarian government over the legislation banning LGBT content. “The outcome is open because it depends on how Hungary reacts,” she said."
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/24/boris-johnson-signals-potential-double-jab-covid-quarantine-exemption;2021-06-24;Portuguese PM hints at tougher Covid rules for tourists from UK;"António Costa’s remarks follow Angela Merkel calling for visitors to EU from Britain to be quarantined
Boris Johnson’s plans to back summer holidays for the fully vaccinated face a stumbling block as Portugal’s prime minister became the first EU leader to suggest he would abide by Berlin’s calls for tighter Covid restrictions on British tourists.
As Johnson talked up the prospects of travel this summer, even declining to rule out a foreign holiday for himself, EU leaders in Brussels were debating how to respond to the highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India and now dominant in the UK.
A summit communique issued in the name of the 27 member states said the bloc would “be vigilant and coordinated with regard to developments, particularly the emergence and spread of variants”.
António Costa, who opened up Portugal for quarantine-free breaks in mid-May to British tourists with a proof of a negative Covid test, hinted at a U-turn in his policy towards travellers coming from the UK as he spoke to reporters at the EU summit.
The Portuguese prime minister said his government had permitted UK tourists to enter the country in recent weeks on the basis of a low number of Covid cases. The UK now has the worst coronavirus case rate in Europe as a result of the spread of the Delta variant.
In response to criticism of his government’s policy since May, Costa said: “We imposed quarantines for countries where case numbers are above the threshold, which wasn’t the case with the UK.”
On Wednesday the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had referenced a rise in infections in Portugal as she called for British tourists to face quarantine wherever they arrive in the EU. Germany insists that travellers from the UK isolate for 14 days on arrival.
Costa said Merkel was “completely right” about needing “to coordinate regarding our external borders, since we have freedom of movement within the European Union”.
Speaking at the Brussels summit, France’s Emmanuel Macron added his voice to the calls for better coordination with regard to non-EU countries such as the UK. France currently permits fully vaccinated UK travellers to enter without quarantine.
Macron said: “We must remain vigilant because of the Delta variant, which spreads faster than the previous variants, and we see that it affects people who are not vaccinated or who have only one dose, so that means we have to go even faster in the vaccination campaign, and, above all, we have to be very coordinated.
“Coordination when it comes to opening borders to third countries and in terms of recognising only the vaccines that have been approved by the European medicines agency.”
The contrast between the British government’s hopes of opening up and the concerns expressed by the EU reflect the relative lack of vaccination coverage in the bloc and fears that the Delta variant could inflict a heavier death toll in the 27 member states than in the UK.
Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, warned on Wednesday of the EU’s vulnerability to a new wave of deaths, given that about 30% of people aged over 80 and 40% of over-60s are yet to receive two vaccine doses.
It is yet to be seen whether the leaders of countries whose economies are highly dependent on tourism will adhere to Merkel’s call.
It remains most likely that fully vaccinated tourists from the UK will be able to avoid quarantine in a number of EU countries. But the leaders’ comments highlight the unpredictability facing those hoping for a summer break, even as the British government prepared to announce the addition of Malta and the Balearic islands to England’s green list of territories from which people will able to return without having to quarantine on arrival.
Speaking hours before the meeting where the changes to the UK’s green list were due to be signed off, Johnson sounded an optimistic note about the prospects of summer breaks for those who had received two vaccine doses.
“I think that the real opportunity we all have now is to open up travel through the double jab,” he said on Thursday, the day after more than 16,000 new cases were recorded in the UK – one of the highest daily figures since the beginning of February.
“If you look at it … more than 60% of our population have now had two jabs. I think 83% have had one jab – we’re really getting through it now. The crucial thing is come forward and get your second jab.”
Johnson said his own summer holiday plans were “at the unformed stage”. When pressed on whether he would be taking an overseas break, he said: “I’m certainly not ruling it in or ruling it out.”
Changes to England’s traffic light system, which classifies countries according to their number of Covid cases and their vaccine and variant situations, were expected to be announced at about 5pm on Thursday and come into force from next Wednesday.
Travellers were stung at the last review point, three weeks ago, when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, vetoed the addition of Malta to the green list, which would have meant that anyone arriving from the country and testing negative for Covid would not have been required to self-isolate, while Portugal was moved to the amber list.
That came as a devastating blow to the aviation and tourism industries, as well as those who had already booked their flights, given the official government advice that people should not travel to amber list countries, and that anyone who travels from them to England must isolate for up to 10 days at home, or use the test-to-release system from day six.
Asked what Johnson thought about the comments of EU leaders, his spokesperson said: “Currently it is down to individual EU member states to decide on the rules governing their borders. We are moving at speed through our vaccination programme to help us curb this latest variant and that will allow us to move to step four, and we are confident that over time it will bring cases down, and that’s the approach we are taking.
“We will continue to have discussions with our European partners on the reopening of international travel, but we’re very confident that our vaccination programme is providing a good way forward.”"

When Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit in December 2005, her fellow leaders included Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac. It was a different world from the one that exists now as she attends what could be her last.
Europe’s divisions over the Iraq war were still raw. Blair was running the European Council, as the British held the EU’s rotating presidency. During the summit, the UK brokered a deal on the EU budget that cut the British rebate to pay for enlargement into central and eastern Europe.
Sixteen years later, the British are out and the EU has survived several near-death experiences following the 2008 financial crisis. Merkel is not only the leader of the EU’s biggest country but also the longest-serving. Now as she prepares to step down as Germany’s chancellor, the EU is preparing for life after Angela Merkel.
When she starts to speak at the European Council, leaders “put their iPhones away”, said the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte. “Pens are put down. And we listen to her.”
Merkel’s ally Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Merkel had the “power to unite – we’ll of course miss that”.
Merkel hasn’t always been seen as a unifying figure. She was accused of imposing painful austerity on bailed-out countries during the eurozone crisis, while a German-inspired plan for mandatory refugee quotas in 2015 sparked fury in central Europe.
But her priority has always been keeping the EU together. In 2015 Merkel overruled her finance minister, who had been toying with Greece’s exit from the eurozone. After a 17-hour summit, Greece stayed.
While renowned for her stamina, the German chancellor is also famous for taking a break when she wants. In 2016 when negotiations over Britain’s special status deal were dragging hours behind schedule, Merkel dashed out to a local friterie for chips with spicy andalouse sauce.
Stamina could be needed again. If German coalition talks drag on for weeks after September’s elections, there is still a chance Merkel will be back for one more summit in October."

Angela Merkel has said travellers from the UK should be quarantined wherever they arrive in the EU, as the union’s agency for disease control forecast that the Delta variant of Covid will account for 90% of cases in member states by the end of August.
Ahead of Thursday’s summit with fellow EU leaders, the German chancellor said she wanted better coordination to fight the spread of the highly transmissible variant that has surfaced strongly in the UK and is now bedding down in the bloc.
“In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine – and that’s not the case in every European country, and that’s what I would like to see,” Merkel told the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
Merkel has criticised Portugal in recent days, where the entry of British tourists is permitted without quarantine. The French government also allows double vaccinated travellers from the UK to enter the country without going into isolation.
Merkel’s call for a uniform policy on UK travellers came as Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said the Delta variant was likely to spread widely among young people this summer, and warned people with a single jab that they were at risk.
In a sombre statement at a time when many EU countries are looking to relax restrictions and facilitate travel through a Covid passport, Ammon said there remained too many people in the more vulnerable age groups in the union who were not fully vaccinated.
The ECDC’s modelling suggests that without maintenance of the current Covid restrictions and a sharp acceleration in vaccination, there is likely to be a wave of infection, deaths and hospitalisation similar to that experienced last autumn.
Ammon called on younger people who may not have received their full complement of jabs to strictly keep to social distancing regulations. She added that the EU’s public health authorities should accelerate their vaccination efforts to save lives as the ECDC published its risk assessment of the Delta variant.
The ECDC’s latest published data suggests that 33.9% of adults in the EU/EEA are fully vaccinated, and 57.1% have had at least a single dose.
“The Delta variant is more transmissible than other circulating variants and we estimate that by the end of August it will represent 90% of all Sars-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the European Union,” Ammon said. “Unfortunately, preliminary data shows that it can also infect individuals that have received only one dose of the currently available vaccines.
“It is very likely that the Delta variant will circulate extensively during the summer, particularly among younger individuals that are not targeted for vaccination. This could cause a risk for the more vulnerable individuals to be infected and experience severe illness and death if they are not fully vaccinated.”
Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, said the positive news was that two doses of all the available vaccines in Europe provided “high protection against this variant and its consequences. However, about 30% of individuals older than 80 years and about 40% of individuals older than 60 years have not yet received a full vaccination course in the European Union.”
The Delta variant, which has slowed down the UK’s reopening, is believed to be 40% to 60% more transmissible than the original virus and is thought to be associated with higher risk of hospitalisation.
The ECDC’s modelling suggests 70% of new Covid infections will be due to this variant in European economic area by early August and 90% of infections by the end of that month.
The EU agency has further modelled that a 50% reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions by September, such as permitting the staging of large events, will lead to an increase of infection across all age groups.
Ammon said the variant put the cumulative efforts to control the pandemic at risk and required “immediate actions” from national authorities.
She said: “There are still too many individuals at risk of severe Covid-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible. Until most of the vulnerable individuals are protected, we need to keep the circulation of the Delta virus low by strictly adhering to public health measures, which worked for controlling the impact of other variants.
“It is very important to progress with the vaccine rollout at a very high pace. At this stage it becomes crucial that the second vaccination dose is administered within the minimum authorised interval from the first dose, to speed up the rate at which vulnerable individuals become protected.”
Ammon added: “I am aware that it requires a significant effort from public health authorities and the society at large to achieve this goal. “But now is the time to walk the extra mile. We have several safe and effective vaccines available and every single infection prevented now through our compliance with public health measures, is a life that can be saved by vaccination.”"

A Germany no longer steered by the experienced hand of Angela Merkel will not head into a post-Covid period of economic austerity, tax rises and geopolitical turmoil, the chancellor’s potential successor has sought to assure the country’s electorate ahead of national elections in September.
Armin Laschet, the candidate for chancellor of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday unveiled a campaign manifesto that promises to weather the fallout from the global pandemic and match the ecological ambitions of his main challenger, the Green party, without creating further burdens on taxpayers and small businesses.
“In order for the economy to find its stride again, businesses must not face further strains,” says the 140-page document, entitled The Programme for Stability and Renewal.
The manifesto vows to reduce tax on small and medium incomes, cap the tax burden on company profits at 25% and complete the phase-out of the “solidarity surcharge” – an additional levy introduced in 1991 to shoulder the costs of reunification and the Gulf war, which has already been phased out for 90% of German taxpayers since the start of this year.
The German conservatives also said they emphatically opposed plans to bring back a wealth tax, as called for in varying degrees in the manifestos of the Green party, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the leftwing Die Linke.
Germany borrowed a record €130.5bn in 2020 as it loosened budget rules to finance pandemic-related rescue and stimulus packages. But Laschet’s election manifesto says his party rejects plans to weaken the so-called “debt brake”, a strict limit on structural government deficits enshrined in the country’s constitution.
“We want to achieve balanced budgets without new debt as quickly as possible and reduce the general government debt ratio to below 60% [of GDP],” the manifesto says.
Unusually, the manifesto opens with a lengthy section outlining the CDU’s agenda on foreign and security policy – a subject not usually considered likely to win elections in Germany, but one where Laschet’s dovish views on China and Russia could be seen to put his party on a back foot.
On paper, Laschet’s party is projecting a more assertive image than he has let on in interviews, vowing to “counter China’s hunger for power with strength and unity in close coordination with our transatlantic partners and other like-minded democracies”, and stating plans for a centralised national security council to pool the country’s intelligence resources.
Damaged by public reservations around Laschet’s leadership qualities, scandals around mask-procurement deals and a sluggish start to Germany’s vaccine rollout, the CDU’s election campaign got off to a poor start, with several polls showing it losing its lead to a buoyant Green party.
But as the pace of the vaccination campaign has picked up, infection rates have dropped and media attention has concentrated mainly on the Greens’ 40-year-old candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, the CDU’s standing in the polls has recovered. Latest polls show the conservatives holding on to a confident lead of about 28%, followed by the Greens on 20-22%.
The CDU manifesto for the 26 September election reiterates the party’s commitment to achieving greenhouse gas neutrality in Germany by 2045, but says it wants to do so mainly through “new technologies and innovations” and the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, rather than bans or restrictive laws.
Laschet’s manifesto foresees Germany becoming a “technological leader for climate-neutral flying” while also promising to help the aviation industry remain “a competitive mode of transport in terms of pricing”.
Markus Söder, the Bavarian state premier and leader of the CDU’s Christian Social Union sister party, used the manifesto launch to criticise a Green party he said had many bright ideas but lacked experience in government.
“You can do green politics without the Greens,” he said."

Benjamin Netanyahu’s ousting closes one of the “worst periods” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but the new government headed by a settler advocate, Naftali Bennett, is just as bad as the last, the Palestinian prime minister has said.
“We do not see this new government as any less bad than the previous one, and we condemn the announcements of the new prime minister Naftali Bennett in support of Israeli settlements,” Mohammad Shtayyeh said, referring to hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis who have taken land in the occupied West Bank.
“The new government has no future if it does not take into consideration the future of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights,” Shtayyeh added.
A far-right former settler leader, Bennett addressed his newly sworn-in cabinet late on Sunday night, saying the country was “at the outset of new days”. The new prime minister has ruled out a Palestinian state and wants Israel to maintain ultimate control over all the lands it occupies. He has previously called for Israel to be more forceful in its attacks on Gaza.
Bennett was once Netanyahu’s chief of staff and a member of his Likud party, but they have become fierce rivals. On Monday, Bennett and Netanyahu held a 30-minute meeting to formally transfer power. However, they skipped the photo op and public well-wishes of previous handovers.
Israel's new prime minister is a far-right former settler leader, who once served as a senior aide and adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu and ran Israel's education and defence ministries in his governments.
Bennett, who wants to annex most of the occupied West Bank, is ideologically close to Netanyahu and was once a member of his ruling Likud party. However, the 49-year-old fell foul of his old boss, who has vowed to work in opposition to topple Bennett's ""dangerous government” and return to power.
A stalwart of Israel’s religious right, Bennett is a former leader of Yesha, the main Jewish settler movement in the West Bank. He has made settlement expansion, the annexation of Palestinian land and the rejection of a Palestinian state a feature of his political platform.
“I would not give another centimetre to the Arabs,” he said in 2018. “We have to drop the idea that if we give them more territory the world will love us.”
The son of immigrants from San Francisco, Bennett became a hi-tech millionaire after selling an anti-fraud software company to a US security firm. On some issues, the former commando is less conservative than his colleagues on the hard right, including gay rights and the relationship between religion and state. Oliver Holmes
Several world leaders publicly congratulated Bennett. And despite the fact that the new leader’s government has explicitly pledged not to make efforts to end the Israeli occupation, some figures abroad highlighted the need to pursue peace in their messages of congratulation.
The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa “remains steadfast in its commitment to a two-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians living in peace, security, and dignity – without fear and with their human rights respected”.
The White House said in a statement that Joe Biden had, in a phone call with Bennett, “conveyed that his administration intends to work closely with the Israeli government on efforts to advance peace, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians”.
An earlier statement said the US president looked forward to working with Bennett, adding: “Israel has no better friend than the United States.”
The European Council president, Charles Michel, said he was looking forward to strengthening the EU-Israel partnership “for common prosperity and towards lasting regional peace and stability”. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “I look forward to continued cooperation on security, trade and climate change, and working together to secure peace in the region.”
Bennett, 49, was sworn in on Sunday evening after the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, a centrist former TV news anchor, won a confidence vote in the Knesset by a razor-thin advantage of 60-59 seats. Under a power-sharing agreement, Bennett will hand the reins to Lapid after two years.
The new administration breaks a political deadlock that has resulted in four snap elections since 2019. During that time, Netanyahu, who is famed for his political skills, managed to keep his rivals bickering and divided while he clung to power, even after he was indicted in three criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.
Bennett leads a self-described “government of change” that is a mix of ideologically opposed politicians from hardline Jewish religious nationalists and a small Arab Islamist party, whose leader, Mansour Abbas, is seen as a pragmatist.
Published coalition agreements showed the new government would focus mostly on economic and social issues, such as passing a state budget and building new hospitals, rather than risk an internal fight by trying to address the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. However, Bennett will have executive powers as prime minister to further solidify the occupation.
In joining the coalition, Bennett has been branded a traitor by some politicians on the religious right, who accused him of abandoning his ideology in order to join Jewish “leftists” and Arab politicians.
Bennett told the parliament before the Sunday vote that Israel had been thrown “into a maelstrom of hatred and infighting”.
“The time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the population, to stop, to stop this madness”, he said, to angry shouts of “liar” and “criminal” from rightwing opponents.
On Sunday night, after Netanyahu was removed from high office, thousands of Israelis waving the country’s blue and white flag packed a square near the Knesset in Jerusalem. Netanyahu’s opponents waved “Bye bye Bibi” placards as they celebrated in central Tel Aviv.
Netanyahu has been in power for so long that – after Sunday’s confidence vote dethroned him – he automatically returned to sit in a seat reserved for the prime minister. After being discreetly prompted by a lawmaker in his party, he moved to a seat designated for the opposition.
The new government’s first major test will be on Tuesday when a parade attended by far-right Jewish nationalists is set to march through Palestinian neighbourhoods of Jerusalem.
Israeli police had changed the route to avoid the Muslim quarter of the Old City after a similar march last month played a key role in building the tensions that led to the latest Gaza conflict. However, the planned march will still pass through Arab areas and is seen as deeply provocative."

With more than 6,000 police deployed to Cornwall for the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, there were surreal sights everywhere: armed officers on residential streets, snipers on rooftops, marine units in St Ives harbour and battleships in the sea. Many residents revelled in the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the action as world leaders and diplomats were convoyed into Carbis Bay, while others objected to the draconian restrictions which included a so-called “ring of steel” around the neighbourhood.
The US president, Joe Biden, landed at Newquay airport in Air Force One amid dense fog, before fellow leaders including the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, touched down the following day. They would spend the next three days in talks, ultimately promising to gift 1bn Covid-19 vaccines to countries in need. The summit’s showpiece event, the G7 leaders’ “family photo”, was staged on the beach in front of Carbis Bay hotel. Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, looked at ease as they elbow-bumped their guests, while Biden was seen in deep conversation with the French president, Emmanuel Macron.
Protesters from all corners of the world made their voices heard. Extinction Rebellion held daily rallies including an eerie penitents march through Falmouth to draw attention to the climate emergency; Surfers Against Sewage organised a mass paddle out at Gyllyngvase beach over concerns about the plight of the oceans; there was a fiery “kill the bill” demonstration opposing proposed new police powers; Palestinians and Kashmiris gathered to condemn violence against their people; and Marvina Newton gave an impassioned speech on the subject of racial justice."

The G7 summit ended with rich nations reaffirming their goal to limit global heating to 1.5C, and agreeing to protect and restore 30% of the natural world by the end of this decade, but failing to provide the funds experts say will be needed to reach such goals.
Boris Johnson badly needed a successful G7 deal on climate finance to pave the way for vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, to be held in Glasgow this November. Climate finance is provided by rich countries to developing nations, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, and was supposed to reach $100bn a year by 2020, but has fallen far short.
Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, said: “The G7 have failed to set us up for a successful Cop26, as trust is sorely lacking between rich and developing countries.”
Without stronger commitments on climate finance, Johnson will face an uphill struggle in getting support for any Cop26 deal from the developing world, who make up the majority of countries at the UN climate talks and who will make or break any deal there.
The prime minister was left to re-announce previously allocated cash, in the form of a £500m blue planet fund for marine conservation, already set out last year, while the other G7 members refused to stump up funds. About $2bn is to be provided to help countries phase out coal-fired power generation, but it is not clear whether this is new money.
The communique promised only: “We welcome the commitments already made by some of the G7 to increase climate finance and look forward to new commitments from others well ahead of Cop26.”
Malik Amin Aslam, climate minister of Pakistan, said: “The G7 announcement on climate finance is really peanuts in the face of an existential catastrophe. It really comes as a huge disappointment for impacted and vulnerable countries like Pakistan – already compelled to ramp up their climate expenditures to cope with forced adaptation needs.”
Poor countries argue that the rich world did most to create the climate crisis, but the most vulnerable nations also face rising debt burdens from Covid-19, and have no money to invest in clean energy, low-carbon infrastructure or ways to adapt to extreme weather.
Aslam warned of the impact on the Cop26 talks: “At the least, countries responsible for this inescapable crisis need to live up to their stated commitments, otherwise the upcoming climate negotiations could well become an exercise in futility.”
Insiders said some of the G7 nations may make further promises on climate finance before Cop26, but were wary of doing so in Cornwall amid an atmosphere of mistrust engendered by the rows over Brexit, on which Johnson is accused of reneging on his commitments, and the UK’s decision to cut overseas aid, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP, which experts said undermined the UK’s call on other nations to increase their climate finance.
The G7 also fell short of campaigners’ hopes on fossil fuels. Last month, the International Energy Agency, the world’s gold standard for energy data and advice, said countries must halt all new fossil fuel exploration and development from the end of this year, to keep within the 1.5C threshold.
Despite committing to an end to financing coal overseas, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, the G7 stopped short of calling a halt to the exploitation of new fossil fuel resources.
Laurie van der Burg, senior campaigner at the pressure group Oil Change International, said: “The G7 has failed to commit to what leading economists, energy analysts, and global civil society have shown is required: an end to public finance for all fossil fuels. Our climate cannot afford further delay, and the failure of the G7 to heed these demands means more people impacted by the ravages of our climate chaos.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/13/g7-leaders-seek-right-balance-dealing-with-china-dilemma-trade-human-rights-climate-crisis;2021-06-13;G7 leaders seek right balance in dealing with their China dilemma;"Analysis: can the west confront Beijing on trade and human rights and cooperate on the climate crisis?
In an extra-secure, 90-minute session, with the phones and wifi cut off, all designed to block any eavesdropping by a prying foreign state, leaders of the G7, with glorious St Ives sunshine outside, wrestled with an issue that will probably dominate the rest of their political lives – China and the right balance between extreme competition and necessary cooperative coexistence.
Kurt Campbell, Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy director, describes the dilemma as presenting “complex coexistence paradigms”, something of which he says the US has had little previous experience.
To put it crudely, can the west hang tough with China on a Monday over trade, human rights and investment rules, and cooperate with them on a Tuesday over climate change?
In the Cornwall discussions, Biden, according to US officials, led in the forceful camp followed by Boris Johnson, the Canadian prime minister and the French president. Biden was especially keen for the G7 leaders not just to decry the use of forced labour in Xinjiang province in western China in their communique, but for the west collectively to agree to act. The fact that Johnson had to propose a working party shows how delicate the issue has become, and how elusive consensus. The Munich security forum last week devoted a whole report to the subject of how liberal democracies can “compete where they must – and … cooperate with competitors where they can”.
Much thinktank time is also expended dissecting how Biden’s approach to China differs from that of Donald Trump. On many counts, Campbell and Matthew Pottinger, Trump’s chief theorist of the China threat, would not disagree. They both came to the view that China is no longer just seeking to become the modern workshop of the world but also an active ideological alternative to the liberal order.
But Trump and Biden’s teams differ on the best response. Biden’s policy is not just to slap tariffs in a trade war or to impose sanctions, but also to join hands with Europe to outcompete, making the west collectively a more compelling example for countries caught between China and the US.
Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Fiona Hill, a former security adviser to Trump, said: “Looking back on the past years Trump was fixated on that trade surplus”, adding that he constantly characterised the EU as a hostile trade competitor virtually indistinguishable from China. “If the US is paying for the EU’s military security then he thought the US should have unfettered access to EU markets.” This made him blind to the virtue of working with the EU to challenge China.
Biden, by contrast, is spending his first week on European soil seeking to woo and reassure his allies after four years on the edge of a nervous breakdown. In Cornwall, he never threw up a chance to send a bouquet, inviting Angela Merkel to the White House, signing an a new Atlantic charter with the British in a nod to the wartime special relationship and insisting he was just delighted he was in the presence of a French president.
But he is also trying to propose to Europe a credible strategy with which to challenge the Chinese state capitalist model. So he proposes a plan for a western belt and road initiative, a plan to replace Huawei’s dominance and a plan to secure critical supply chains.
Jennifer Hillman, from the Council on Foreign Relations, points out that the White House last week produced a 100-day report entitled “building resilient supply chains, revitalising manufacturing and fostering broad-based growth”. The paper was not just a blueprint to revive the US economy, it is really about getting American and European capitalism fit enough to compete with state-sponsored Chinese capitalism.
Its focus is semiconductor manufacturing; large-capacity batteries, such as those for electric vehicles; critical minerals and materials; and pharmaceuticals and advanced pharmaceutical ingredients. In every product sector, the White House report makes explicit reference to “working with Europe”.
Hillman says this “is not all about decoupling from China but instead adding resilience to supply chains and ending sole sourcing. It’s less about shutting down trade, but being more competitive.”
The same can be said for “build back better world”, the proposal to set up a rival to the Chinese belt and road initiative by offering developing countries a transparent green route to investment in ports, roads and digital infrastructure. The scheme, judging by a White House note, is a work in progress, has little new money attached and seems to be about rebadging a network of existing US and EU schemes. But it is a start.
It is ambitious plans such as these that allow Emmanuel Macron to claim Biden has already shown that leadership is about partnership. Sitting by the president he said: “It’s great to have a US president part of the club and very willing to cooperate.”
Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a resident fellow at the German Marshall Fund, says Europe is becoming more receptive to Biden’s China message. “Europe is in a very different place than it was before new year. I put this down to the absolutely completely disastrous Chinese diplomacy as much as anything the Biden administration has done.”
“The Chinese decision to slap personal sanctions on European parliamentarians, its bilateral diplomacy with smaller member states,” he said, meant the Chinese investment deal with the EU – long championed by Germany and agreed in principle in December “is not going anywhere”.
Either way, he says China is in slow political retreat across Europe. The last meeting of the 17 plus one group set up with China to woo EU member states was attended by middle-rank officials. Lithuania has pulled out altogether. If the German Greens have a role in the next coalition government this autumn, the political grouping in Europe most hostile to China will demand an end to Merkel’s determination to trade on almost any terms.
But potentially the pivotal figure is one of the newcomers to G7 summitry, and also a figure to which other leaders listened with respect – Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, and the current chair of the G20.
In May 2019 Italy, under the influence of the Five Star movement, joined the Chinese belt and road initiative during a state visit by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, thus throwing Italy on to the frontline of Beijing’s battle for global power and influence. Italy between 2000 and 2019 had become Europe’s third-biggest beneficiary of Chinese investment, receiving a total of €15.9bn versus €50bn in the UK, €22.7bn in Germany and €14.4bn in France. The founder of Five Star, Beppe Grillo, even met the Chinese ambassador in Rome on the day Draghi arrived at the G7.
Draghi may be a technocrat running a six-party coalition, but he is moving Italian foreign policy towards a more Atlanticist perspective, shedding the willingness of the previous two governments to seek partnerships with China.
In March he issued a decree blocking Huawei and ZTE from fulfilling a contract with the Italian telecommunications firm Fastweb. But Draghi, as chair of the G20, has to take difficult ideas agreed at the G7 on climate finance and carbon trading into this wider forum, so he urged the G7 not to cause undue offence to China.
Johnson, supposedly riding shotgun for Biden on China, in reality probably differs little from the pragmatic Draghi. Certainly many backbenchers would be surprised to learn this self confessed Sinophile was leading the charge against China at the G7. The UK business department last week turned down a raft of recommendations from the business select committee to get tough with China over forced labour in Xinjiang. Graham Stuart, the minister for exports at the Department of International Trade, told a Lords select committee last week: “China offers more opportunity to the UK economy than any other market.”
There is one final piece of the jigsaw often left out in the discussions about what to do about China, and that is China itself. Campbell says that at the turbulent meeting in Alaska with the Chinese the US did not meet Xi’s inner circle. He said Xi is leaning on a smaller and smaller group that works on decision making.
The normal hallmark of China diplomacy was the ability to self-correct and retrench when it overstepped the mark, he said. The question is, is that feedback – “look, the steps that you’re taking are undermining Chinese soft power” – getting through to the most inner circle in the Chinese leadership cadre?
“That is a question we cannot answer, but over the course of the last year or two the country that has done the most to create problems for China is not the United States, but China.”"

Germany’s Green party has said it remains confident of securing the chancellorship and succeeding Angela Merkel at the country’s autumn election despite a drop in the polls, as it officially endorsed its lead candidate for the job.
Setbacks in recent weeks have led to the Greens slipping to second place behind Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) after commanding the polls for the first time in years. But this did not dissuade delegates from wholeheartedly throwing their support behind Annalena Baerbock at the party’s annual gathering on Saturday.
She received 98.5% of support at the weekend conference in a former post office rail depot in Berlin which many participants watched via video link.
Using her victory speech to emphasise the “fundamental changes and reforms” that she said were needed throughout Germany, Baerbock, 40, said: “There can be no more excuses, no ducking or muddling through … we are fighting for a new awakening.”
She apologised for mistakes she had made in the past weeks, including over her failure to register extra payments to parliament as well as errors on her CV that have since been corrected. Critics have seized on both incidents, saying they prove the party’s lack of professionalism and trustworthiness, and they are believed to have contributed to her own personal fall in the polls from a month ago – from 28% to 16% – to put her behind her main rival, Armin Laschet of the CDU.
The latest poll showed the Greens have dropped 6 points in the polls to 20% and the CDU has risen 5 points to 28%, prompting speculation over whether the Greens will manage to regain their momentum.
The poll results have also led to calls for Baerbock’s co-leader, Robert Habeck, to take the candidacy from her, although the idea was rejected at the weekend. Their joint leadership was also reconfirmed in a vote on Saturday.
Baerbock thanked the party for its “full solidarity” and for the “tailwind” it had given her to deal with the “headwind of the past few weeks”.
The mood surrounding the end of the 16-year Merkel era, together with urgency over the climate emergency and growing optimism that the pandemic will soon be under control, is being seized on by the Green party, which hopes to garner many new voters when Germans go to the polls on 26 September.
Merkel announced in October 2018 that she would be stepping down as chancellor in 2021 and would not be seeking any further political posts after the end of her term. She has served as chancellor since 2005 and her decision followed a series of election setbacks for the CDU which she became leader of in 2000.
“For the first time in decades change is in the air,” Baerbock told delegates. “An era is coming to an end, and we have the chance to found a new one.”
But the party’s biggest challenge remains how it will take voters with it, amid a growing realisation that enthusiasm among young people in particular to do something for the climate crisis does not necessarily translate into ballots as easily as it might have hoped.
Analysts have compared the gap between ideology and the ballot box to intent and action, pointing at studies that show that Germans’ intentions to behave in an environmentally friendly manner do not mean they will. In a recent questionnaire, 24% of frequent flyers said they would be prepared to pay a form of compensation for the C02 emissions they had caused. But in reality less than 1% do so.
The party is aware of the difficulty it will have to communicate the link between what it sees as moral aspiration and tangible action without sounding heavy-handed and didactic.
It has a long-standing reputation, which it is trying to shake off, as a stickler for regulations. It was ridiculed for suggesting the introduction of one meat-free day a week in work canteens eight years ago; it has been attacked for appearing to recently question the ecological sense of single-family homes; and Baerbock earned scorn after appearing to suggest short-haul flights should be banned. What she actually said was that the rail network should be developed to the extent that short-haul flights would become obsolete, but that was not the line which stuck.
But the overall and perhaps most damaging impression being successfully pushed by opponents is that the Greens could make life for many Germans not just more rule-bound and restrictive, but also a lot more expensive.
The party’s plans to raise petrol prices have earned it derision and prompted accusations its policies will hit the least well off, leaving Baerbock and Habeck at pains to prove they will strive for social fairness.
Delegates have grappled with the question of whether the party can manage to communicate its message that measures such as higher fuel costs and CO2 emission compensation will ultimately translate into a better world. It has pledged to give revenues back to those less well off.
Habeck, in particular, tried hard to hammer home the message to delegates and the wider audience, that the party is one of “Freiheit nicht Vorschrift” – freedom not regulation.
But while for some party supporters its policies are seen as going too far, others feel the party is not going nearly far enough.
The traditional frictions between the 40-year-old party’s wings of so-called “realos” (realists) and “fundis” or fundamentalists have changed, but the groups still very much make their positions felt and the gap between them is often considerable.
In a row over the CO2 emission price, party leaders have insisted they are committed to €60 (£51) a ton from 2023. But Jakob Blasel, a 21-year-old climate activist who wants to represent the party in the Bundestag, delivered a passionate plea to delegates via video link for a price of €80 a ton by 2022, to rise annually by €15. Only then, he argued, would Germany have a chance of reaching Paris climate goals to limit global warming to 1.5C. He warned the Greens against “beating a hasty retreat in the face of criticism” over climate protection."

Britain and Germany were under intense pressure on Saturday to drop their resistance to proposals that would slash the cost of Covid-19 vaccines, following accusations that an agreement at the G7 summit to fund a billon doses will give the world’s poorest countries “crumbs from the table”.
Aid agencies said rules that protect drug patents from being illegally copied must be waived during the pandemic to accelerate the rollout of vaccines and save lives across the developing world.
South African president Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday told G7 leaders in Cornwall that a temporary lifting of Covid-19 vaccine patents was essential to save lives among Africa’s 1.2 billion people.
In what is being seen as a repeat of the row in the 1990s over the high cost of HIV retroviral drugs to African countries, campaigners said countries such as the UK and Germany that play host to successful vaccine makers should support a deal to share patents.
Oxfam warned that a failure to get agreement on waiving vaccine patents to reduce the price of each dose would mean increasing the overall cost to poor countries by at least 10 times.
The US and France have joined more than 100 countries that have demanded the major vaccine makers drop their patent rights to allow the rapid manufacture of vaccine doses at a fraction of the current cost.
The US president, Joe Biden, has supported the proposal, which would see Moderna supply vaccine doses at cost to the poorest countries.
But the UK has refused to do the same. A spokesperson for Boris Johnson said the prime minister preferred that individual countries secured low-cost commitments from vaccine suppliers, as the UK did in a deal with AstraZeneca, rather than agree a global deal to lift vaccine patents.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has also rejected the move, saying it would dissuade pharmaceutical firms from investing in drugs and would create “severe complications” for the production of vaccines. German officials have complained that trade barriers imposed by Britain and the US on medical supplies has proved a more significant barrier to the production of vaccines.
Jürgen Trittin, a member of the Green party and former environment minister, told German news agency DW that lifting vaccine patents was not a solution: “The producers have their cooperation partners even in the South. The problem is export hurdles. And these hurdles come from the US and also from the UK ... so, I think it’s a little bit of a blame game, a scapegoat game, that Joe Biden is playing here.”
Germany is host to two of the three most successful vaccine developers – Pfizer/BioNTech and CureVac – that produce vaccines with high efficacy rates and, unlike the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, are easy to manufacture. The CureVac vaccine is expected to be cleared by the regulator for use in the next few weeks.
The US company Moderna also uses new mRNA technology adopted by BioNtech/Pfizer and CureVac. The founders of Biontech and Moderna have become multi-billionaires in the last year following the success of the vaccine rollout programme.
Boris Johnson has offered to share 100m of the 500m doses purchased by the UK as part of a G7 plan under discussion to distribute 1bn doses to poor countries by the end of the year. The US contribution to the total is 500m doses.
The charity Global Justice Now called the UK’s donations “a PR gimmick” that will allow the G7 to ignore the structural problem of intellectual property rules driving vaccine supply shortages.
It praised Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for supporting an intellectual property waiver.
Nick Dearden, the charity’s director, said: “Boris Johnson’s lofty promises to vaccinate the world have today been wiped out like a surfer in Carbis Bay.
“The UK has bought 500m vaccine doses; well beyond what we need. And yet today we’re only offering to give 100m doses to the rest of the world – and only by the middle of next year. It’s little more than a PR gimmick.
“Intellectual property rules are restricting vaccine production to the supply chains of a handful of companies. This weekend, Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel can finally step up to the plate, follow Biden’s lead, and clear away these barriers, so we can vaccinate the whole world.”
The director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said following a meeting with G7 leaders at the summit that a temporary waiver of the intellectual property that underpins the new vaccines was “essential” to achieve the WHO’s target of vaccinating 70% of the world’s population by next year’s G7 summit.
He said: “We are in the race of our lives, but it is not a fair race and some have not yet left the starting line. I think the IP waiver is essential. Considering the challenges we are facing now, it is very important. The [pharma companies] should not be going for high profits.
“But this is not to take away the property of the private sector. We have proposed to high income countries a package of incentives so there can be a balance between support from government and a sense of social responsibility by the private sector.”
Tedros said the dependence of the world on a few vaccines produced by a handful of pharmaceutical companies was an example of “market failure” that needed to be addressed by governments. While the WHO had worked hard to drive down the price of vaccine doses and encourage the distribution of doses to the poorest countries through the Covax global distribution network, it was wrong that many decisions about the number of vaccines in production and the cost of vaccines were in the private hands of a few people.
“When there is market failure there should be an entity that intervenes. And when this does not happen, governments should intervene.”"

Leaders of the world’s seven leading industrialised nations will meet in Cornwall this weekend to agree a communique on how to redraw the world post-Covid, but also to pursue their own agendas and try to forge new personal relations after nearly 18 months apart.
1. Joe Biden has restored order, calm and direction to US international alliances, but now has to show what he will do with that goodwill.
Two self-imposed tests for Biden will be to convince Europe he is not a temporary throwback, and to set out a plan to prevent the 21st century being the Chinese century. The overarching goal is to show democracy delivers better.
He has laid out a three-part US plan to end vaccine apartheid, including distributing 80m surplus vaccines, stepping up domestic vaccine production and diversifying vaccine production worldwide. He has also backed, in the face of opposition from the EU and World Bank president David Malpass, the compulsory waiving of intellectual property rights for vaccines at the WTO. The EU regards a legal fight over patents as pointless.
Biden wants the G7 to develop a western alternative to the Chinese belt and road offer, part of the US plan to make the US more competitive with China. In a sign of US political mood the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill spending a quarter trillion dollars over five years in R&D to beat China in the race for technological advantage.
2. With Trump gone, probably any competent chair of this G7 would have been able to revitalise a moribund body, and by good fortune, the task fell to Boris Johnson.
If he pulls off his goals at the summit, he will argue it shows the UK retains its role as a deft problem solver. But much hangs in the balance – a plan to vaccinate the world by the end of next year, new carbon finances, extra cash for girls’ education, a minimum corporation tax and a clearer democratic alliance against autocracy. But words and deeds need matching. So far: no surplus vaccines distributed, UK aid budget cut, a chancellor seeking to exempt financial services from the corporation tax and a foreign secretary spending the pre-G7 summit week on a visit to Saudi Arabia.
3. Emmanuel Macron, mercurial, intellectual and restless, faces a threat from the far right in next year’s presidential elections, and a defeat would transform Europe and democratic politics. Polling better than recently, he has been on a tour de France to reconnect with French citizens as the Covid confinement closes. No fan of Johnson, he is quite happy to spar with the UK over the rights of French fishermen, or EU migrants. He will try to put himself at the helm of any plan to boost the flow of vaccines to Africa. France has already promised to send its surplus abroad. He had urged the UK to ask the Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, to speak at the summit.
4. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, has stepped into the shoes of an internationalist activist Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September. Abe’s cabinet secretary for seven years, Suga will not alter the pillars of Japanese foreign policy, including a free and open Indo-Pacific, but his interests seem more domestic than global. He will be seeking international support for his unpopular decision to press ahead with the Olympics. He will also want pledges to counter a Chinese law that enables its coast guard ships to fire on foreign vessels in waters that Beijing deems its territory.
Japan is a carbon backmarker. In October Japan promised to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, but still relies on coal for almost a third of its electricity, making it the world’s fifth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. The country’s coal use increased after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with a total 48GW of coal power capacity installed.
5. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, leaves the stage in the autumn after attending 15 G7 summits. She has seen off the threat to the liberal order posed by Donald Trump and so preserved the concept of the west. She would cherish a deal with the US over the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that she supports, and which the US says will damage Ukraine and strengthen Russia. With the threat of US sanctions on Germany over the pipeline lifted, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Germany has now come to the table on how to protect Ukraine. The German foreign office is heavily backing US plans for EU-US cooperation on the supply of strategically important minerals and raw materials. Overall, she may be uneasy at the US rhetoric towards authoritarian regimes.
Merkel took the commercially convenient view that trade and contact would bring political change. Covid cases are down in Germany and she would like Biden to lift travel restrictions.
6. With Merkel’s departure, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, is to find himself shortly as the unlikely Grand Old Man of the G7. He is due to hold a bilateral with Biden at G7, where he will discuss the issue of Meng Wanzhou, the senior Huawei executive, mounting a legal battle to fight extradition from Canada to the US on fraud charges. She protests it was a political arrest by the Trump administration, but China has imprisoned two Canadians in retaliation. If the US dropped its hardly watertight case the Canadians would surely be released.
The opposition accused him of being too soft on Chinese human rights abuses. His minority administration is heavily in debt and initially slow to the vaccine race, but the appointment of Chrystia Freeland, as finance minister gives him global ballast.
7. Mario Draghi, renowned as the saviour of the collapsing euro with his “whatever it takes” promise in 2014, has been Italian prime minister only since February. He was called to the flag to save Italy from Covid. No stranger to summitry as the former head of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019 and former governor of the Italian Central Bank from 2006 to 2011, it is said that even outside office, he was “the only Italian that could call anyone in the world”. His domestic task is to find growth, and keep his six-party coalition afloat until elections scheduled for 2022. But Italy is the current chair of the G20 – its summit is in Rome in October, and whatever the G7 agree, he must bring to this wider forum."

Angela Merkel’s method of winning elections has earned its own phrase among German political scientists: “asymmetric demobilisation”, the art of running a campaign that skirts around hot-button issues in order to present voters with a choice between personalities rather than policies.
Three and a half months before Germany goes to the polls, Merkel’s aspiring successor Armin Laschet seems to have taken her strategy to heart. With a campaign that has so far failed to tackle the country’s hard choices on carbon emissions, digitisation, eurozone integration and military spending, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its candidate for chancellor may get away with it too.
As the country has been released into the summer from an exhausting seven-month lockdown, the political conversation has come to focus on Laschet’s closest rival, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, and questions around her résumé.
On Saturday, Baerbock’s campaign spokesperson said the CV on her official website had been “adjusted and corrected” to clarify that the Green party co-leader had never been a “member” of the German Marshall Fund and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Instead, the organisations were now listed under the header “Advisory boards, (sustaining) membership, regular support”.
The correction came shortly after Baerbock’s team had to fend off accusations that her LSE master’s degree in international public law did not justify her calling herself a Völkerrechtlerin, an expert in international law.
Questions over the wording on a CV would not normally be the making of a political scandal. CDU candidate Laschet’s CV, too, contains inaccuracies, omitting to mention a spell at the RWTH Aachen University during which the politician lost his students’ test papers and marked them on the basis of his notes instead. He resigned from his lectureship after the error emerged.
After a strong start to Baerbock’s campaign in which  the Green party leapfrogged the CDU in several polls, recent surveys have put Germany’s conservatives back in the lead, without quite regaining the dominance at the height of the Merkel era.
Baerbock’s “unforced error”, wrote commentator Stefan Kuzmany in Der Spiegel, “creates a picture of an overly ambitious candidate who constantly wants to represent more than she really is”.
Merkel, more than any postwar German politician, knew how such impressions could swing elections. One slogan forever associated with her 16-year chancellorship in Germany is a phrase she uttered in a TV debate with her then-rival Peer Steinbrück ahead of the 2013 elections: “Sie kennen mich” (you know me).
In spite of Merkel’s imminent departure from the political scene, the strategy of prioritising personality still holds. In each of the three state elections held in Germany this year, the incumbent premiers managed to defend their title or even improve their majority. One, the Green leader of the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg, simply copied Merkel’s “Sie kennen mich” slogan.
Laschet, too, seems to have settled on what Der Spiegel called a “sleeper carriage strategy” for winning the national vote on 26 September, even if his personal popularity ratings are way below those of the outgoing chancellor.
Less than four months before the election, the German electorate can get an idea of the political offerings by flicking through draft or finalised manifestos of five out of the country’s top parties.
Voters can, for example, find out that the Social Democratic party (SPD) wants a “citizens income” to replace the unemployment and welfare package introduced by its last chancellor, leftwing Die Linke plans a wealth tax and the Greens want to increase petrol and diesel prices more quickly.
The only party that has yet to present a manifesto – outlining, for example, by which route it aims to achieve an 88% reduction of carbon emissions by 2040 – is Laschet’s Christian Democrats.
Until a presentation on 21 June, the CDU will continue to consult with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, on which policies it wants to offer potential voters."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/06/angela-merkels-cdu-beats-far-right-in-crucial-german-state-election;2021-06-07;Angela Merkel’s CDU beats far right in crucial German state election;"Conservative win in Saxony-Anhalt seen as last big test ahead of national election in September
Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) fought off a challenge from the far right in a state election on Sunday seen as the last big test for Germany’s political parties before a national vote in September that will end the chancellor’s 16 years atop German politics.
The CDU, whose current leader, Armin Laschet, will vie for the top job in September, improved on its 2017 performance to gain 37% of the vote in the eastern state, according to public service broadcaster ARD early on Monday. Reiner Haseloff, the state premier, said the result symbolised “a clear demarcation against the far right”.
The nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) came second on 21% but underperformed in light of some polls that had suggested the far right would challenge the CDU for the top spot.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, expressed his relief at the AfD’s disappointing night, calling the outcome “a victory for democracy”.
Governed for the last five years by a “Kenya coalition” between the CDU, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Greens, Haseloff could, in the next electoral term, switch to a power-sharing deal with the SPD and the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) – known as a “Germany coalition”, after the colours of the national flag – or a “Jamaica” alliance with FDP and Greens.
After a string of sobering results in state elections this spring, Sunday’s result amounted to “almost something like a comeback” for Merkel’s conservatives, wrote Der Spiegel. The CDU secretary general, Paul Ziemiak, described the outcome of Sunday’s vote as a “sensationally good result”.
Laschet had ruled out any form of power-sharing deal with the AfD in the run-up to the vote, saying his party’s “firewall” against the far right would stand firm.
Home to 2.2 million people, the Saxony-Anhalt state election does not reflect the standing of the six leading parties in the country as a whole. Support for the AfD, for one, is considerably higher and stable here than in other areas of Germany, in spite of its eastern branches pursuing more openly xenophobic policies.
But as the last state election before the national vote in September, the outcome will be eagerly examined for hints at broader underlying dynamics.
The lagging appeal of the leftwing Die Linke party and centre-left SPD in this area of what was once part of the socialist German Democratic Republic is representative of a broader malaise of the German left.
On 10.7% of the vote, Die Linke lost 5.6% of votes compared with its 2016 results – its worst result in this eastern state since the party’s foundation in 2007. Support for the SPD dropped to 8.2%, one of the party’s worst results at a state election full stop.
The Green party, which is still performing strongly in national polls, traditionally struggles in the German east, and will be the weakest of six parties in the next state parliament, on 6% of the vote. “We improved our result,” said the Green co-leader and chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock, “but not in the way we had hoped to.”
The Greens, who even leapfrogged the CDU in some surveys after Baerbock was unveiled as candidate, have lost some momentum in recent weeks as other parties from across the political spectrum have started concentrating their fire on Green policies, such as a gradual fuel price increase.
The Free Democratic party, which is enjoying a nationwide resurgence fuelled by some frustration with the pandemic management of Merkel’s government, re-entered parliament in Saxony-Anhalt on 6.5% of the vote, ahead of the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation.
The FDP, a traditional junior ally of the CDU that shares its aversion to household debt, has also seen an upswing in support at a national level. Party leader Christian Lindner said he interpreted the result as a vote of support for his party’s economic competence and suggested reforms in the areas of digitalisation and education.
The CDU’s strong showing in Saxony-Anhalt likely has much to do with personality: Haseloff, who has been state premier here for a decade, enjoys approval ratings of 81%.
Whether the glow of his success will rub off on Laschet remains to be seen. Haseloff was one of the voices within the Christian Democratic party who spoke up against Laschet’s run for the top job."

Armin Laschet, the leader of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and her potential successor as chancellor, has insisted his party’s “firewall” against the far right will remain intact, as the CDU braces itself for a strong performance by the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Sunday’s state elections in Saxony-Anhalt.
The AfD, which first entered the German parliament in 2017, is stagnant on about 11% of the vote in polls for the national vote in September, but has shored up its influential positions in several states of the formerly socialist east.
In Saxony-Anhalt, surveys predict the far right could challenge the governing CDU, some of whose delegates in the region have expressed more openness to a power-sharing arrangement with the AfD than the party’s national leadership.
While the CDU of the incumbent state premier, Reiner Haseloff, is expected to form the next government, a recent survey by the pollster Insa put the AfD in top spot, on 26%, with the conservatives second on 25%.
“The CDU has to play its part to make it clear we won’t talk to them, we won’t cooperate with them, we won’t enter a coalition with them,” Laschet told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on Tuesday. “We don’t wont to cooperate with them – on any level,” he said.
Laschet also distanced himself from the WerteUnion (“Values Union”), a CDU pressure group lobbying for more hardline conservative policy positions that last week elected the controversial economist Max Otte as its new chair. Though formally a CDU member, Otte has said he voted for the AfD at elections in 2017.
Laschet’s predecessor, the former Merkel continuity candidate Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, stumbled over the “firewall” principle in 2020, resigning from the CDU chair after politicians from the branch in neighbouring Thuringia voted with the AfD to oust the state’s premier, Bodo Ramelow of the leftwing Die Linke party.
Saxony-Anhalt is governed by Germany’s first power-sharing administration between the CDU, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens – nicknamed the “Kenya coalition” after the colours of the east African country’s flag.
In theory, at least seven other coalitions would be possible after the vote on 6 June, including a four-way “Zimbabwe” alliance between the CDU, Greens, SPD and pro-business FDP.
Some local party branches in Saxony-Anhalt have agitated for a membership vote on the next coalition deal, which could embolden some delegates to stray from the CDU’s red lines. Even a minority government tolerated by the far right would breach a taboo in Germany’s postwar political culture, especially since the AfD has been campaigning in Saxony-Anhalt with a more openly radical agenda than elsewhere.
In its party programme, the AfD says it wants to introduce a “baby bonus” exclusively for families in which at least one parent holds German citizenship, exclude refugee minors from regular classrooms and withhold tax money from artists who are not “principally affirmative towards their own German culture”."

Reports that Denmark’s military intelligence agency helped the US to spy on leading European politicians, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have sparked concern – and demands for an explanation – in EU capitals.
Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio said the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose alleged tapping of Merkel’s phone was disclosed by Edward Snowden in 2013, also used the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (FE) to spy on officials in Sweden, Norway and France.
The allegations are contained in an internal classified report on the FE’s role in the surveillance partnership agreement with the NSA from 2012 to 2014, the broadcaster said, citing nine unidentified sources familiar with the investigation.
It said the NSA used Danish information cables to spy on senior officials including the former German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the then opposition leader Peer Steinbrück. It was not clear whether the Danish government authorised the taps.
The Danish defence minister, Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was reportedly informed of the espionage in August last year. She told Danmarks Radio that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies” was “clearly unacceptable”.
France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said the reports were “extremely serious” if proven. “We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors in their cooperation with American services,” Beaune told French radio. “Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation.”
Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday that the German government had “taken note of the reporting. It is in contact with all relevant national and international authorities for clarification.”
Steinbrück said the NSA and FE’s activities were “a political scandal”. The former centre-left SPD party leader said he accepted western states needed intelligence services, but added it was “grotesque that friendly intelligence services are indeed intercepting and spying on top representatives of other countries”.
Danmarks Radio published the allegations on Sunday evening in a joint investigation with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, France’s Le Monde, and Germany’s NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The Danish broadcaster said the NSA retrieved text messages, calls and internet traffic including searches and chats thanks to its partnership with FE. Denmark, a close US ally, hosts several key landing stations for undersea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.
Neither the agency or its director at the time, Lars Findsen, have commented on the report. Findsen and three other FE officials were suspended last year by an independent oversight board following criticism and accusations of serious wrongdoings stemming from the internal investigation, which began in 2015, Danmarks Radio said.
The NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, demanded “full information” and his counterpart in Norway, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said the allegations “are being taken seriously”.
If confirmed, the spying was happening during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, when the former NSA contractor revealed thousands of secret documents exposing the vast US surveillance operation mounted after the 2001 9/11 attacks.
Snowden on Sunday accused Joe Biden, who was US vice-president at the time, of being “deeply involved … the first time around”. Snowden called on Twitter for “full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well”.
The former contractor has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence and is in Russia."

Germany has to agreed to pay Namibia €1.1bn (£940m) as it officially recognised the Herero-Nama genocide at the start of the 20th century, in what Angela Merkel’s government says amounts to a gesture of reconciliation but not legally binding reparations.
Tens of thousands of men, women and children were shot, tortured or driven into the Kalahari desert to starve by German troops between 1904 and 1908 after the Herero and Nama tribes rebelled against colonial rule in what was then named German South West Africa and is now Namibia.
Since 2015, Germany has negotiated with the Namibian government over what it calls an attempt to “heal the wounds” of historic violence.
“Our aim was and is to find a joint path to genuine reconciliation in remembrance of the victims,” the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said in a statement. “That includes our naming the events of the German colonial era in today’s Namibia, and particularly the atrocities between 1904 and 1908, unsparingly and without euphemisms.
“We will now officially call these events what they were from today’s perspective: a genocide.”
On Thursday, official circles in Berlin confirmed reports in Namibian media that after nine rounds of negotiations the two sides had settled on the text of a joint declaration and a sum of €1.1bn, which will be paid separately to existing aid programmes over 30 years.
Of the overall sum, more than a billion euros will go towards projects relating to land reform, rural infrastructure, water supply and professional training. Communities of Herero and Nama descendants, which form ethnic minorities in all of the seven affected regions, are meant to be involved in the development of the specific projects.
Some €50m will go towards setting up a foundation for reconciliation between the two states, including cultural projects and youth exchange programmes.
The text of the joint declaration calls the atrocities committed by German troops a “genocide” but omits the words “reparations” or “compensation” – a move borne out of fear that such language could set a legal precedent for similar claims from other nations.
A spokesman for the Namibian president, Hage Geingob, described German’s acknowledgment of genocide “as the first step” in the right direction. “It is the basis for the second step, which is an apology, to be followed by reparations,” the spokesman said.
Some of the numerous groups that make up the descendants of the genocide’s survivors have been critical of the framing of the negotiations from the outset and have declined to back the Namibian government’s stance.
Paramount chief Vekuii Rukoro, leader of the Ovaherero Traditional Authority, has criticised his government for not insisting on financial reparations: “When German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier comes to Namibia to render the apology we will embarrass him,” he told local media.
Namibian newspaper New Era reported on Thursday that at least three traditional leaders who had supported the government’s negotiations up to this point had refused to endorse the final wording of the declaration, which could make it difficult for President Hage Geingob to sign the deal.
The German side’s position is that it has negotiated the agreement with a Namibian government representing the country’s population as a whole, and that the deal does not stand or fall on the approval of Herero and Nama descendants groups."

When a political career ends in disgrace, it is usually over a dodgy backroom deal, an extramarital affair or rumours of a sordid sexual fetish. Not in Germany, where the darkest possible stain on a politician’s honour is a slapdash footnote in their doctoral thesis.
Or so it seems, after family minister Franziska Giffey last week became the third minister of a Merkel government to leave office over PhD plagiarism accusations, while the Green party’s candidate for the chancellery was forced to release her LSE degree certificate to fend off accusations she had inflated her intellectual credentials.
Giffey, a Social Democrat who will run to become the next mayor of Berlin in spite of her resignation, left her post after reports that the German capital’s Free University is considering revoking her PhD in political science over academic malpractice.
Her stepping down makes plagiarism scandals the single most common cause for premature departures from Merkel’s cabinets in the past 16 years.
The university’s reassessment of Giffey’s PhD was nudged by VroniPlag Wiki, a crowdsourcing platform that searches German doctoral theses for plagiarism and brought about the fall of high-flying defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg in 2011.
In the 10 years since, seven further German politicians, including education minister Annette Schavan in 2013, have had their doctoral titles revoked. Doubt has been cast on the qualifications of numerous others, including the PhD of the current president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen.
“We have different perceptions of academic degrees in Germany and the UK,” said Gerhard Dannemann, a professor of law at Berlin’s Humboldt University who contributes to the anti-plagiarism website. “In Germany, a doctorate used to be your best passport to respectable society if you weren’t part of the nobility.
“Even if that’s no longer the case, it is still something people brandish to enhance their reputation, especially young politicians trying to make their mark,” said Dannemann, who used to teach at University College London and Oxford University.
More than 80% of members of Germany’s parliament have a university degree, a similar percentage to that in the House of Commons in the UK, where a larger part of the general population attends higher education than in Germany.
The number of Bundestag members with doctorates is considerably higher, however: 17%, compared with 3% in Westminster.
“If a German politician is a doctor of law, he or she would add it to their election leaflet,” said Dannemann. “In Britain, they would probably hide it.”
The social pressure to gain a precious doctor title while already embarked on a time-demanding political career can lead to corner-cutting, he told the Observer.
Some politicians get around the problem by simply doing their dissertation on themselves. Franziska Giffey’s dissertation was on the European Commission’s engagement in civil society, using her own work as a commissioner for European affairs in Berlin’s Neukölln district as an example.
Former chancellor Helmut Kohl’s doctoral dissertation mainly dealt with the history of his own regional party branch of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Those who stray outside Germany’s academic tradition can nonetheless arouse suspicion, even if their alma mater is an international elite university – as Green chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock has learned the hard way.
After some of her political opponents had questioned whether Baerbock had the credentials to call herself a Völkerrechtlerin, an expert in international law, her spokesperson recently tweeted pictures of her degree certificate from the London School of Economics, where the 40-year-old politician passed an MA in International Public Law with distinction in 2005.
Some rightwing blogs went on to allege that Baerbock had tricked her way into the reputable British university since she had completed her studies at Hamburg with a Vordiplom but not a bachelor degree – that had not yet been introduced at German universities at the time.
“I cannot quite understand how studying four years for a first degree and then going abroad to pass a masters degree at a highly respected institution like the LSE can somehow be turned against her,” plagiarism hunter Dannemann told the Observer."

EU leaders have given short shrift to a proposal by Joe Biden and backed by the pope to waive Covid-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supply, insisting that the White House should instead allow the export of doses and of the key ingredients.
At a summit in Porto, a series of European leaders, including those who had previously appeared open to suspending intellectual property rights, said Biden’s idea was not a priority and expressed frustration at the US president’s attempt to claim the moral high ground.
Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, whose foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, had commended the White House for the proposal earlier in the week, said it was more important that the US and UK governments remove blocks on exports.
“Before getting to the liberalisation of vaccines, other simpler things should be done, such as removing the export block that today the US firstly and the UK continue to maintain,” he said.
“This, I would say, is the first thing to do. The fact of liberalising the patents, even temporarily, does not guarantee the production of the vaccine.”
Neither the UK nor the US has a formal export ban but Washington has deployed the Defense Production Act to force manufacturers to fulfil domestic contracts ahead of other orders while the British government’s contract with AstraZeneca also prioritises UK requirements.
On Wednesday Biden’s top trade adviser, Katherine Tai, had said that given a shortfall in vaccine production around the world, the World Trade Organisation should back a waiver on vaccine patents, which would allow pharmaceutical companies to make copycat vaccines without fear of legal action by manufacturers such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Pope Francis offered his backing for the idea on Saturday, criticising those putting “the laws of the market or intellectual property above the laws of love and the health of humanity”.
But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has rejected the proposal, saying it would dampen entrepreneurial innovation. BioNTech, a German company, owns a patent on a vaccine jointly developed with the US company Pfizer which uses the latest mRNA technology.
She doubled down her opposition on Saturday and put the onus on the US to play a larger role in supplying the world.
“I do not think that a patent waiver is the solution to make more vaccines available to more people,” she said. “Rather, I think that we need the creativity and the power of innovation of companies, and to me, that includes patent protection.”
Merkel said innovation should not be “weakened such that no rapid adaptations for virus variants can be found”.
“The problem is not that people are sitting on their patents and not taking action,” she added.
“Now that a further part of the American population has been vaccinated, I hope that we can come to a free exchange of components and an opening of the market for vaccines.”
The European Council president Charles Michel, who chaired the summit in Portugal, said the EU was open to discussion within the WTO on the proposal but that the bloc had doubts that patent waivers were the “magic bullet” in the short term and encouraged “all the partners to facilitate the export of doses”.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, also declared that “patents are not the priority”.
“I call very clearly on the United States to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production,” he said.
“The key to producing vaccines more quickly for poor countries and developing countries is to produce more, to lift export bans.”
At the summit, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced a contract with drugs giant Pfizer/BioNTech for up to 1.8bn doses of their patented vaccine had been concluded.
The contract allows the EU to donate doses contained within the contract and Von der Leyen said Europe was proving to be the world’s “pharmacy”.
She said: “Those regions who are producing vaccines at large scale should share these vaccines through export and, again, I can only repeat we are the only democratic region in the world producing vaccines at large scale and exporting.”"

Emmanuel Macron has echoed the German government’s concerns over Joe Biden’s proposed suspension of intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines as he urged the US and the UK to instead start exporting doses around the world.
Arriving at an EU summit in Porto in Portugal, the French president expressed his reservations about the White House proposal to waive patents and criticised the lack of exports coming from “Anglo-Saxon” countries.
“What is the current issue?” he asked. “It is not really about intellectual property. Can you give intellectual property to laboratories that do not know how to produce and will not produce tomorrow? The main issue for solidarity is the distribution of doses.
“Today, the Anglo-Saxons block many of these ingredients and vaccines,” he said. “Today, 100% of the vaccines produced in the United States are for the American market.”
Neither the UK or the US has a formal export ban but Washington has deployed the Defense Production Act to force manufacturers to fulfil domestic contracts ahead of other orders while the British government’s contract with AstraZeneca also prioritises UK requirements.
A waiver on vaccine patents would allow pharmaceutical companies to make copycat vaccines without fear of legal action by manufacturers such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
The proposal was aired by Biden’s top trade adviser, Katherine Tai, on Wednesday. Her claim that the “extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures” forced a public statement from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in which she said she was “open” to discussing the issue.
Speaking in Porto, Von der Leyen took a bullish approach, in a sign of the frustration felt at the US approach. She said: “We should be open to this discussion but when we lead this discussion there needs to be a 360 degree view on it as we need vaccines now for the world. In the short and the medium term the IP waiver will not solve the problem, will not bringing a single dose of vaccine in the short and medium term.”
She added: “We invite all those who engage in the debate of waivers of IP rights also to join us to commit to export a large share of vaccines being produced in that region.”
But within the European Commission – which had only been informed shortly before the announcement of Biden’s proposal – and among the EU’s 27 member states there are serious reservations.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had already rejected the US idea, warning that “production capacities and the high-quality standards, not the patents” is the problem facing the world and that a “waiver” would have “serious implications”.
“The protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and it must remain so in the future,” she had said on Thursday.
BioNTech, a German company, owns a patent on a vaccine jointly developed with the US company Pfizer which uses the latest mRNA technology.
On Friday the Canadian government said it was also willing to discuss the idea but emphasised the need to foster entrepreneurial innovation. “Canada has actively worked with partners to identify barriers to vaccine access many of which are unrelated to intellectual property, such as supply chain constraints,” Canada’s trade minister, Mary Ng, said. “Our government firmly believes in the importance of protecting IP [intellectual property] and recognises the integral role that industry has played in innovating to develop and deliver life-saving Covid-19 vaccines.”
EU officials said they had not yet seen the details of Biden’s proposal but there was “no proof on the table” that the vaccine patents held by manufacturers had been restricting supply around the world.
The newly appointed director-general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian economist, echoed the sentiment on Friday, adding that while Africa was importing 99% of its vaccines patents “may not be the critical issue”.
She said the WTO was aiming for a “pragmatic solution that assures access to developing countries to deal with vaccine inequity, while at the same time making sure we don’t disincentivise research and innovation”.
There is growing frustration in Brussels and European capitals that the US is seeking to take the high ground given that EU-based manufacturers have exported 200m of doses while the White House has put a block on vaccines leaving its shores.
“I would be delighted if the United States shows the same willingness to export vaccines that we in Germany do,” Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday.
EU leaders are expected to discuss their position on a patent waiver at this weekend’s summit in Porto, with the 27 member states divided on the best way to proceed. A qualified majority will have to be found for a position which the commission will take into negotiations with the US and other members of the WTO.
“We have not been given a single example where capacity has been restricted because of the protection of patent or other intellectual property rights,” one EU official said. “If that was the case … we already have the instruments that will allow us to react to that question”.

Officials said that an alternative would be for members of the WTO to apply for “compulsory licences” where a government permits a local manufacturer to produce a product or process without the consent of the patent owner for domestic consumption.
Alternatively, a government could apply for compulsory licence to export to a country that lacks the manufacturing facilities to provide for its domestic market. “The urgency now is what is the best pragmatic solution to use manufacturing capacity and produce as many vaccines as possible in the short term,” the EU official said."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/04/eu-suspends-ratification-of-china-investment-deal-after-sanctions;2021-05-04;EU efforts to ratify China investment deal ‘suspended’ after sanctions;"Political outreach to promote the massive trade agreement stalls after tit-for-tat sanctions prompted by Beijing’s policy in Xinjiang
The European Commission has said that efforts to ratify a massive investment deal with China have been in effect suspended after tit-for-tat sanctions were imposed over China’s treatment of its Uyghur population in March.
“We now in a sense have suspended … political outreach activities from the European Commission side,” said the commission’s executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, on Tuesday. He said that the current state of relations between Brussels and Beijing was “not conducive” for the ratification of the deal, which is known as EU-China comprehensive agreement on investment.
“It’s clear in the current situation with the EU sanctions in place against China and Chinese counter sanctions in place, including against members of European parliament [that] the environment is not conducive for ratification of the agreement,” Dombrovskis said. He added that it will now “depend really on how broader EU-China relations will evolve”.
Although Dombrovskis’s comments do not suggest the pact has been formally suspended, they do, however, suggest that recent tensions between Brussels and Beijing have dampened the EU’s appetite for such a deal with China.
The European Union and China approved a controversial investment agreement in late December after seven years of marathon negotiations. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave the talks a final push; the Chinese market is especially important to German carmakers and manufacturers who have a large presence in the country.
At the time, the pact was defended as a long-overdue opening to China’s vast market that would benefit European companies. If ratified, it could lead to Beijing loosening some of its notoriously stringent rules on foreign companies such as the need to operate through joint ventures with local partners.
The conclusion of the negotiations was a diplomatic victory for China’s leader, Xi Jinping. The talks were wrapped up in a video call with Xi, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, president Emmanuel Macron of France and Merkel herself.
But the agreement angered China sceptics and human rights activists in Europe.
Some of them had long lobbied Brussels to impose sanctions on China over its treatment of its Uyghur population and its policy on Hong Kong. The Biden administration publicly voiced its displeasure as well.
Then, in a dramatic turn of events in March, the European Union imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials involved in Beijing’s policy on Xinjiang. In response, China swiftly imposed counter sanctions that targeted several high-profile members of the European parliament , three members of national parliaments, two EU committees, and a number of China-focused European academics.
Analysts said that Dombrovskis’ comments on Tuesday were unsurprising and reflected how relations between Beijing and Brussels have deteriorated in the last few months. The chances of further progress, according to Michael Reiterer, distinguished professor at Brussels School of Governance, look uncertain.
“As long as members of the European parliament are on sanction list – impossible,” he said."

A German “jab to freedom” bill that would from this weekend lift social-distancing rules, testing requirements and curfews for people who have been fully vaccinated, is drawing criticism for discriminating against young people still months from getting their first dose.
The legislation, authored by the justice minister Christine Lambrecht and approved by Angela Merkel’s cabinet on Tuesday, argues that people who have either recovered from a Covid-19 infection or been fully vaccinated against the virus must regain their basic rights because they no longer pose a threat to society.
People in those groups would be freed from the need to show a negative test before entering shops, hairdressing salons or zoos, according to media reports. They would also no longer be required to quarantine after entering Germany unless they are travelling from a country that has been designated a high-risk area.
Critics say the new rules would unfairly exclude younger people who have already sacrificed their social lives to protect a high-risk older population for more than a year.
Restrictions currently in place in German regions recording more than 100 infections per 100,000 people over seven days, such as a two-household rule for private get-togethers and a night-time curfew, would also no longer apply to those who have had two doses of the vaccine.
The legislation would not yet free vaccinated people from the requirement to wear a mask in designated public spaces, nor grant them privileges when booking hotels or holiday apartments.
The bill is to be debated in front of the two legislative bodies of the German parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, on Thursday and Friday, and could come into effect as soon as the weekend.
The drive to loosen restrictions comes as Germany enters its sixth month of tough coronavirus controls and five months ahead of national elections that will give voters a chance to cast their verdict on the government’s handling of the pandemic.
After a rickety start, Germany’s vaccination drive has recently kicked into gear: 28.7% of the country’s population had received its first dose by Tuesday morning and 6.7 million people have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Some federal states have already pushed ahead with special privileges for vaccinated people. The Bavarian premier, Markus Söder, said on Tuesday that test requirements or the night-time curfew would no longer apply to vaccinated or recovered people in his state from this Thursday.
The southern state is also planning to reopen outdoor dining, theatres, concert halls and cinemas in low-incidence regions for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people from 10 May.
Dr Wolfram Henn, a genetic scientist who sits on the German Ethics Council, advocated in the Berliner Zeitung newspaper for the government to prioritise children and teenagers for the next phase of vaccinations before the jab became available to all.
Germany’s police union has warned that the yellow paper passports with vaccine-specific stickers currently used to certify citizens’ immunity status can be easily forged. An EU-wide digital vaccination passport, the “digital green certificate”, is not due to be launched in Germany until June.
Scientists have also voiced concerns about freeing individuals from the need for testing. “It would be fatal if vaccinated and recovered people are in the future no longer required to be tested upon arrival in a country”, said Ute Teichert, the head of the Federal Association of Doctors in the Public Health Service.
“Without extensive testing we will lose track of infections, especially with view to variants of the virus,” Teichert told the Funke media group."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/03/polls-put-german-green-party-in-lead-five-months-before-election;2021-05-03;Polls put German Green party in lead five months before election;"Six out of 10 polls published in past two weeks put Greens ahead of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union
A green wind of change is blowing through Germany’s political landscape as a poll-of-polls on Monday puts the Green party above Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) only five months before national elections.
The aggregate poll, published by Pollytix Strategic Research, puts the Greens in the lead for the first time since June 2019.
Germany’s party landscape has long proven more resistant to sudden upheavals than its European neighbours, with the CDU holding on to its status as the country’s supreme political power while sister parties in France or Italy slipped into oblivion.
But latest polls suggest the conservatives, who have governed Germany for the last 16 years, could be ousted as the strongest party in the Bundestag on 26 September.
Six out of 10 polls published over the last two weeks instead show an advantage for the Greens, who scraped into sixth place when Germany last went to the polls in 2017. A survey published by pollster Kantar and Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday gave the Greens in a three-point lead, on 27%.
It suggests the ecological party’s candidate, Annalena Baerbock, could even find herself in the comfortable position of being able to pick and choose from a variety of potential coalition partners, with possible power-sharing deals with the CDU, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Free Democrats, or the SPD and leftwing Die Linke.
Stefan Merz, the director of pollster Infratest Dimap, said the currently expressed voting intentions would need to remain in place for two to three weeks to prove reliable indicators.
“But after years of very little movement in the hierarchy of Germany’s political parties, there is now a sense that the deck is being reshuffled and we could be on the threshold of a historic moment,” Merz told the Guardian.
Volatility is showing in the polls as the German public has increasingly turned against the government over a lengthy but ineffective semi-lockdown and a vaccination rollout that exposed the poor state of the country’s digital services and bureaucracy.
Armin Laschet, the 60-year-old CDU leader and Merkel continuity candidate, was presented as the party’s man for the top job just as the outgoing chancellor has looked more powerless and short of ideas than at any point in her 16-year leadership at the top of Europe’s largest economy.
LSE graduate Baerbock, 40, who has been the Green’s co-leader for three years but lacks experience in higher office, has launched her campaign on a message of reform, proposing, for example, a term limit for the chancellor under her leadership.
“Experience can act as drag, tying you to the past,” Der Spiegel wrote of Baerbock’s candidacy. “New, visionary ideas often come from young minds.”
The underlying theme of her campaign so far is that Germany is more innovative than its political class – a claim that got a boost last week when the country’s constitutional court ruled that the government’s climate targets do not go far enough.
But there is still uncertainty about the Green party’s chances because German voters have shown again and again how much they value continuity.
Polls in the run-up to the federal vote in 2005 indicated a towering 15-point lead over the governing Social Democrats for the CDU, then entering its first election with Merkel as candidate. In the end, her party only won the election by a thin margin.
In 2017, too, the announcement of Social Democrat Martin Schulz’s candidacy pushed his centre-left party’s ratings above those of the governing CDU. But by the start of the summer, the hype around Schulz had evaporated.
“The question is whether the Greens can keep up their momentum once the majority of the country has been vaccinated, the shops reopen and people can go on holiday again,” said pollster Merz. “If the national debate shifts to the economy at that point, the CDU could regain some lost ground.”
Whether Laschet, a politician who has struggled to rally his own party behind his candidacy, can convince the German public that he is the right man to keep the country on an even keel, will be one of the key questions of the coming months.
One key factor distinguishes the vote in September from those that came before. For the first time since 1949, Germans will head to the voting booth in an election where the incumbent chancellor will not be standing for reelection. All of Merkel’s predecessors either lost their last election or resigned before completing their last term in office.
“When voters go to the polling booth, they tend to focus on their prospects in the future rather than the achievements of the past,” said Matthias Jung, a pollster for research institute Forschungsgruppe Wahlen.
“At best, the high points of the last 16 years will be remembered as a badge of basic competency,” Jung told the Guardian. “Merkel’s successes are only inheritable to a very limited degree.”"

After German federal elections in September, Europe’s largest economy is likely to be led either by a human rights champion sending steely messages to Russia and China, or a dovish politician who wants Vladimir Putin to be given more respect.
Surprisingly, the former hails from a Green party founded by peace activists during the cold war arms race, and the latter chairs a conservative party that traditionally sees itself as America’s most loyal ally in German politics.
With a coalition between Annalena Baerbock’s Greens and Armin Laschet’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) one of the likelier electoral outcomes in the autumn, a foreign policy clash could define Germany’s early days in the post-Merkel era.
Under the outgoing chancellor, Germany has mostly trodden a middle path, speaking up about human rights violations and democratic ideals, while also heeding its ravenous industry’s appetite for Chinese export markets and Russian energy supplies.
“With Joe Biden in the White House, a geopolitical strategy of having your cake and eating it is becoming harder to justify,” said Ulrich Speck, a foreign policy analyst. “In a paradigm of strategic competition between America and China, there’s now pressure on Germany to position itself.”
Baerbock, a 40-year-old with a background in international law, has been one of the Greens’ most vocal advocates of tying German foreign policy more firmly to values rather than economic needs.
If she were to become chancellor, she has vowed to withdraw government support for the almost complete Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Germany and Russia, which critics say will boost Putin’s geopolitical influence.
Echoing rhetoric from within the White House, she recently said that Germany’s relationship with China should be marked by a “competition of systems: authoritarian powers versus liberal democracy”.
“The clarity with which the Greens now talk about sanctions against Russia – including a stop of Nord Stream 2 – and position themselves on China is remarkable,” said Ralf Fücks, a former Green politician who heads the Centre for Liberal Modernity thinktank.
Laschet’s foreign policy instincts, by contrast, are harder to pin down. In Germany, the 60-year-old’s jovial Rhinelander persona has created an image of a politician whose interests do not extend far beyond the borders of North-Rhine Westphalia, where he has been state premier since 2017.
In fact Laschet’s interest in foreign policy precedes his career in politics: as editor of the Catholic newspaper KirchenZeitung Aachen the then 30-year-old wrote a weekly editorial on international affairs, dedicating his first column in July 1991 to why the European community was wrong to offer financial aid to Yugoslavia and discourage independence movements in Croatia and Slovenia.
He further fed his passion after being elected in 1999 to the European parliament, where he became rapporteur to the European neighbourhood policy, designed to tie eastern and southern states more closely to the EU.
Laschet was a politician looking for partners rather than enemies, former colleagues recall: a transatlanticist, a European, a friend of Israel. His attitudes to Russia were dovish, they say, but not unduly: the idea that the EU’s eastward expansion needed to be balanced with respect for Russian interests was CDU orthodoxy at the time.
“Armin Laschet was never a maverick,” said Charles Tannock, a former British Conservative MEP who shared a seat on the European parliament’s foreign affairs committee with the Christian Democrat. “He was grounded, affable and prudent: a safe pair of hands. To call him pro-Putin would be an exaggeration.”
Some contemporaries concede the CDU chancellor candidate’s foreign policy instincts may have been formed in a period that lacked the geopolitical tensions of today, however.
“Armin arrived in Brussels the same year Putin became prime minister of Russia, when people were investing a lot of hope in this new leader,” remembers one former colleague from his party bloc.
“He left the European parliament a year after the EU’s eastern enlargement, and wasn’t there to see how former eastern bloc states changed western European’s perception of Putin’s Russia. Maybe he’s still a little bit stuck in the honeymoon years.”
It would offer an explanation for some missteps that have made even party colleagues shake their heads in bewilderment. In 2014 he criticised America for “trying to weaken” Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in his fight against Isis, in a tweet reply to US secretary of state John Kerry.
The Christian Democrat’s defenders pointed to his Catholic faith and empathy for Syria’s Christian minorities, which many western politicians believed to be best protected by Assad at the time. But the off-piste comments became a pattern.
In April 2018, Laschet used Twitter to criticise the British government for “forcing” Nato members to condemn Russia over what he saw as limited evidence proving its role behind the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal. His own country’s government had considered the evidence sufficient.
Laschet’s silence on the attempted poisoning of Alexei Navalny was condemned strongly by the Greens – Baerbock expressed her irritation with the CDU leader’s “friendly tone towards Moscow”.
North-Rhine Westphalia is not only home to energy company Uniper, one of Nord Stream 2’s financiers, but also the port of Duisburg, a key hub for China’s belt and road initiative.
There is little question about Laschet’s passion for the European project, which comes across as less learned and more heartfelt than Merkel’s from a politician who grew up in a part of Germany that borders Belgium and the Netherlands. “People from border regions have always been quicker than those from elsewhere at overcoming the divisive nature of borders”, he wrote in his debut editorial for the Aachen church newspaper.
Speaking at the Munich security conference in February 2020, Laschet and Baerbock agreed that Germany had done too little to respond to French president Emmanuel Macron’s call for a more unified European foreign policy.
“Laschet seems open to the idea of the EU becoming a more robust geopolitical actor,” said Jana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations’ Berlin office. “In that area, the CDU and the Greens may find themselves on the same page after all.”"

European leaders are lifting restrictions across a lockdown-weary bloc as they take what Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, has admitted is a “calculated risk” that accelerating vaccination campaigns will keep stubbornly high infection rates in check.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, will present details of a progressive relaxation of Covid measures on Friday, the prime minister, Jean Castex, said on Wednesday, conceding that virus circulation “remains high … but is on a real downward trend”.
France’s rolling seven-day average of new infections has dipped below 28,000 for the first time in more than a month, but hospitals this week exceeded 6,000 Covid-19 intensive care patents for the first time since during the first wave in April 2020.
The French health minister, Olivier Véran, said the South African variant of the virus had risen from 6% to 10% of new cases detected in the greater Paris region, although no infections had been confirmed in mainland France with the Indian variant.
“We have to continue our efforts, particularly against the new variants,” Véran said after millions of primary pupils returned to school this week following a three-week “lockdown lite”. Secondary schools are due to reopen next Monday.
A ban on people travelling beyond a 10km (6 mile) radius of their homes is also set to be lifted on 3 May, with non-essential shops and bar and restaurant terraces expected to open later in the month, along with the country’s nationwide 7pm curfew.
Like other EU member states, France is counting on its vaccination campaign, which is gathering pace rapidly after a slow start, to keep case and hospitalisation numbers down. More than 27% of French adults have received a first dose.
Germany raised its economic growth forecast for 2021 on Wednesday, also citing the gathering pace of vaccinations as light at the end of the tunnel after struggling for months to put in place concerted action to halt a virulent second wave.
An amended law in force from Saturday gives Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government greater powers to impose restrictions, including night curfews and school closures, following a lengthy tug of war with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states.
Under the regulation, all regions with incidence rates of more than 100 new infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days must apply shutdowns and curfews, while schools must go online if the incidence rate exceeds 165.
Hopes are growing, however, that curbs can be eased in coming weeks as the proportion of Germans with at least one injection nears 25%. Merkel underlined this week that Europe’s biggest economy is aiming to offer every adult a jab from June.
Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has announced an easing of restrictions from next week, saying that in terms of new infections the worst of the pandemic “is probably behind us” and pointing to grounds for “cautious optimism”.
Shopping malls and museums should reopen from 4 May, when the first three school years will also return to class, with other pupils due to resume in-person classes on 29 May. Hotels will reopen on 8 May and cafe and restaurant terraces on 15 May.
Indoor service will resume from 29 May, when theatres and cinemas will also be able to reopen, Morawiecki said. About 11 million people in Poland, which has a population of 38 million, have received at least one Covid vaccine dose.
On Wednesday, the Netherlands lifted a night-time curfew that has been in place for the past three months, and allowed bars and restaurants to serve on outdoor terraces – with no more than two customers per table – between noon and 6pm.
Despite infections running at their highest level since January and Dutch hospitals operating near capacity, shops can also admit more customers and people may now welcome two guests rather than one into their homes in any 24-hour period.
In Italy, bars, restaurants, cinemas and concert halls will partially reopen on Monday after months of stop-start restrictions, with three-quarters of the country’s regions dropping into the low-risk “yellow” categories.
The decision means bars and restaurants can serve customers outside – including, for the first time in six months, in the evening – although a 10pm curfew remains in place. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls will also be able to open at 50% capacity.
Swimming pools, gyms, sporting events and theme parks are expected to follow suit by 1 July in a progressive relaxation that Draghi has admitted is a gamble, with case numbers and intensive care admissions falling slowly but deaths still mounting.
Although there are major disparities between its different regions, Italy’s vaccination programme is gathering pace, with more than 17.5m jabs administered so far in a population of about 60 million.
The cheif executive of the German pharmaceuticals company BioNTech, meanwhile, said on Wednesday Europe could achieve herd immunity – estimated by experts at about 70% of the population – against Covid-19 within the next four months.
“Europe will reach herd immunity in July, latest by August,” Uğur Şahin said. The EU is expected this week to announce a deal to buy a further 1.8bn BioNTech shots in anticipation of a possible need for booster shots."

It is often said of Armin Laschet that he never even wanted to go into politics, but ended up joining the CDU only due to the persistent persuasion of an acquaintance. Four decades on, he is the leader of Germany’s most populous state, leader of the Christian Democrats and the conservative alliance’s candidate for chancellor.
If the CDU – which has governed Germany for 51 of the past 71 years – wins September’s federal election, he will step into Angela Merkel’s shoes as the leader of Europe’s largest economy.
Yet despite scoring these major political feats, it is still maintained that this jovial Rhinelander is a hesitant politician, to whom the idea of a career plan has always seemed a little absurd. His successes have sometimes appeared to have been achieved almost by accident by someone often considered “too nice” for politics.
But it has also frequently been said that Laschet has been consistently underestimated, and that his man-next-door affability – which in other politicians might be viewed as a weakness – is an image the 60-year-old has deliberately honed, and which has ended up being the main driving force behind his rise.
The son of a coalminer-turned-teacher, Laschet grew up in a devout Catholic household in Germany’s westernmost city, Aachen, with three brothers. His life revolved around the church, where he was an altar server as well as a member of the choir, which is where he met his childhood sweetheart and future wife, Susanne, a bookseller with family roots over the Belgian border in French-speaking Wallonia. Both are fluent French speakers.
He is frequently described as Heimatbewusst, literally aware of his home or rooted to his origins, a trait embodied in the fact that he still lives where he was born, in Burtscheid district of Aachen. The family home – his children are grown up – is a modest brown brick terrace house with a neat front garden, in a spielstrasse – a street free of traffic to allow children to play. The core of his social network is said to have remained more or less the same tight circle of family, church and school friends for six decades.
Apart from periods spent studying in Munich and Bonn, Laschet’s private life has barely extended more than a few kilometres beyond Burtscheid, quite the contrast to the sprawling metropolis of Berlin, which he would have to get used to as chancellor.
He embodies the same matter-of-factness that is widely admired in Merkel, and which his backers hope will add to his voter appeal in the run-up to the election, but detractors say might backfire in voters hoping for something fresh. Laschet has been at pains to nurture the impression he is in touch with the common man or woman. During his speech before the vote for party leader at the CDU’s digital conference in January he emphasised his humble beginnings, holding up the identification tag worn by his father when he went down into the coalmine each day. His message was: 1,000 metres underground, everyone is an equal, and people need to be able to rely on each other. It went down well with the delegates, who voted for him above his rival, Friedrich Merz, a millionaire conservative investor, by 521 votes to 466.
Laschet studied law in Munich, trained as a journalist and was editor-in-chief of the church newspaper for the Aachen diocese. He became a member of the conservative Catholic student association Aenania and has nurtured the contacts of its members throughout his political career, even as he has tried to present himself as a more liberal Catholic despite rejecting the idea that homosexual couples should have equal rights in German family and tax law. Most prominent of his Aenania contacts is Nathanael Liminski, a CDU politician and Laschet’s chief of staff as state leader in Düsseldorf. An arch-conservative, Liminski has close links to the lay Catholic group Opus Dei, sometimes referred to as a Catholic cult.
Laschet became a city councillor in Aachen after failing to complete his law exams and was elected to the Bundestag in 1994, subsequently becoming an MEP. He was appointed the country’s first integration minister in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in 2005, declaring Germany to be a “multicultural society”, which earned him ridicule from rightwing members of the party who nicknamed him “Turkish Armin”. He went on to become the regional CDU head, before rising quickly in 2017 to the post of state leader of NRW – an industrial region, which before he took the reins had been a longtime stronghold of the left-of-centre Social Democrats.
As its leader, Laschet has generally been popular, but he has earned criticism and ridicule during the pandemic, for a series of faux pas – including wearing his mask off his nose and opening a furniture store at a time when the infection rate was soaring. His hesitant and indecisive management style, including his recent calls for a “bridging lockdown”, which drew scorn, has sometimes left him at odds with his erstwhile ally, Merkel, who has pointedly refused to get involved in his candidacy.
Elsewhere, Laschet has been a defender of Merkel’s chancellorship, even sometimes adopting her “wait and see” style of leadership. He famously supported her controversial decision to keep open Germany’s borders during the European refugee crisis of 2015. His staunch defence of open borders – even pushing for them to be kept open during the pandemic – is said to stem from his experience of living in Aachen, in what is called the Dreiländereck or the “three-country corner” in close proximity to Belgium and the Netherlands,
His biographers, Tobias Blasius and Moritz Küpper say one of the main secrets of Laschet’s success is his ability to “irradiate a jovial continuity and a friendly normality”. As party leader, Laschet has said he wants to preserve the CDU as a party of the people – a melting pot of diehard conservatives, environmentally sympathetic urban dwellers and modern liberals in the Merkel mould. It is said he would like to extend this idea to Germany as a whole.
What the German people want five months ahead of the election remains to be seen. In the thick of a third wave of coronavirus, morale is low as is confidence in politics to steer the country out of the crisis.
The pandemic has exposed many flaws in the way Germany operates, from a lack of flexibility to a clunky and disjointed approach to digitalisation. Laschet has said he accepts that the person who next takes the reins faces the challenge of having to navigate the country into a better place where it can learn from its mistakes.
But recent polls indicate a lack of conviction in his ability to lead, with only 15% of Germans seeing him as a suitable chancellor candidate, compared with 44% for his rival Markus Söder who, having accepted defeat this time around in the succession contest, is expected to mischievously goad him from the wings."

A heated struggle is under way between two leading German politicians over who should stand as Angela Merkel’s successor as chancellor candidate in the next election, with the conservative alliance under pressure to choose between a consensual team player with a reputation for pliability or a charismatic political all-rounder in the populist mould.
After attending a meeting of the CDU/CSU’s parliamentary faction on Tuesday afternoon, rivals Armin Laschet and Markus Söder emerged to say that the talks were productive and that they hoped there would be a decision by the end of the week.
The camps behind Laschet, the chair of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Söder, the Bavaria state leader and head of the CDU’s sister party, the Christian Social Union, are so divided over the issue that questions are being asked as to whether the embattled conservative alliance will be able to restore its unity in time for September’s election.
There has been much criticism that the rivalry has diverted too much attention from the fight against the pandemic, now in its third wave.
Laschet, a 60-year-old Catholic coalminer’s son from Aachen, received the formal backing of CDU regional leaders as chancellor candidate on Monday. As the head of the dominant party in the alliance, which would have to have a convincing reason to let the smaller sister party steal the limelight, he ultimately has the better chance of being chosen.
But Söder, a 54-year-old Protestant son of a building constructor from Nuremberg, who announced his candidacy on Sunday, has the support of an estimated 70 CDU MPs out of 245. He is the most popular among CDU voters and is the person the German population at large are most keen to see as the successor to Merkel.
According to a recent poll by YouGov, just 12% of Germans were in favour of Laschet as chancellor candidate, compared with 46% for Söder.
Laschet was chosen as the CDU’s new chairman in January, in an low-key poll following the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who had been Merkel’s personal choice but failed to rise to the challenge. But subsequent historically low election results for the CDU in regional elections in Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg, and Laschet’s perceived indecision during the pandemic, have reflected badly on him. His recent proposal for a so-called “bridge lockdown”, to help span the time gap between the current rise in coronavirus infections and when the effect of vaccines will kick in, was widely ridiculed.
In contrast, Söder’s no-nonsense crisis management, in which he has often pushed ahead with lockdown restrictions as the federal government has appeared to dither, has earned him praise – even if Bavaria has not fared better in the crisis than elsewhere. He is also adept at stealing headlines, including by last week announcing a pre-contract deal to procure 250m doses of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V, which has yet to receive official approval.
Söder said this week his greater popularity should be decisive. “The real crisis would be if we were outperformed in the election.” Currently the alliance has less than 30% in the polls. “Our goal has to be to reach a much better result than that … we have the potential to secure 35 plus,” he said.
Paul Ziemiak, the CDU’s general secretary, said: “Armin Laschet has a broad support … this is about the ability to lead, the ability to bring people together, in a team; it’s about the power to integrate the whole of society … and Laschet is the one best able to do this.”
The only two German general elections in which a CSU chancellor candidate has appeared did not go in the Bavarian party’s favour. Franz Josef Strauss secured 44.5% of the vote in 1980, but it was not enough to topple the coalition government of Helmut Schmidt. Twenty-two years later, the battle between Edmund Stoiber and the Social Democrats’ Gerhard Schröder ended in a 38.5% tie, but failed to unseat the incumbent coalition.
The open warfare between Laschet and Söder is being referred to by the German media as the most important power struggle of the year, a political duel that threatens the parties’ delicate symbiosis. It could, after all, decide who picks up the reins of Europe’s biggest economy after almost 16 years of Merkel. Even more importantly in most German minds, the person who wins will have to attempt to steer the country, including its embattled economy and society, into a stable and prosperous post-Covid 19 era.
Both men have said they want a decision to be made before the Whitsun bank holiday weekend in May. But the alliance is under pressure to make clear its direction before then, with the Greens, its biggest rival, set to announce on Monday which of its two leaders is to stand as candidate.
Asked on Tuesday whether she was worried the pair’s rivalry could damage the bloc and lead to it losing the chancellery, Merkel made clear she had no intention of intervening. “I wanted, want to and will stay out of it,” she said."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/09/merkel-sets-out-plan-to-take-control-of-germanys-covid-response;2021-04-09;Merkel sets out plan to take control of Germany’s Covid response;"Bill would give national government power to impose restrictions in states with high infection rates
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, plans to take control over the Covid-19 response from federal states to impose restrictions on regions with high numbers of new infections, as the head of the country’s disease control agency said Germany needed a two- to four-week lockdown to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.
“Germany is in the middle of a third wave, so the federal government and the states have agreed to add to the national legislation,” a spokesperson for the German chancellor told reporters on Friday.
“The aim here is to create uniform national rules,” she added, explaining that a change to the country’s pandemic law would likely be put before cabinet on Tuesday next week.
According to reports in the German press, the bill would allow the national government to impose night-time curfews, shop closures and strict testing requirements for businesses in regions that are recording more than 100 new infections per 100,000 people over the course of seven days.
Under the current balance of power, Germany’s states are free to decide how they interpret the requirements of the “emergency brake” mechanism. In recent weeks Merkel has repeatedly expressed her frustrations with state premiers unilaterally loosening restrictions in spite of rising infection numbers.
“The solution we have found was necessary because the emergency brake was being applied in very different ways”, her deputy spokesperson, Ulrike Demmer, said on Friday, adding that talks between Merkel and state premiers planned for Monday had been cancelled.
Changing the law comes with considerable risk for Merkel: enshrining specific infection rates in legislation could require her government to put the law to endless ad-hoc parliamentary votes as the pandemic situation changes. A more permanent power-grab could in turn be blocked by the Bundesrat, the constitutional body through which the states participate in the legislative process.
Despite cultural venues, restaurants and leisure facilities having been closed since last November, Germany has been unable to prevent a third wave of the virus, driven by the more infectious B117 variant first discovered in the UK.
On Friday the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s disease control agency, reported 25,464 new infections within the past 24 hours, the highest daily rate of the country’s third wave so far. A reporting lag caused by the Easter break means the latest numbers may not yet give an accurate indication of the pandemic’s dynamic.
But the health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday that reports from hospitals around the country painted an alarming picture, with the number of Covid-19 patients on intensive care beds having risen by 20%, to 4,500, over the course of the past week.
“If the trend continues, then that is too many for our health system,” said Spahn. The number of free intensive care beds has fallen to 2,911, the lowest number since the start of the pandemic.
Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, said a lockdown lasting two to four weeks was necessary to break a third wave that could no longer be completely stopped. “Every day in which we don’t act, we lose lives”, Wieler said at a joint press conference with Spahn.

In the meantime, a gear change in the country’s vaccination programme is providing a source of hope. On Thursday, Germany injected 719,927 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, the second record number in a row and almost twice as many as on Tuesday.
As of Friday morning, Germany had vaccinated 14.7% of its population against Covid-19. General practitioners being integrated into the rollout as of this week, the start of second-dose injections and an enthusiasm for the AstraZeneca vaccine among the over-60s have been attributed as factors behind the gear change.
Nonetheless, Wieler said on Friday that Germany was still some time away from being able to squash the pandemic curve through vaccinations alone."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/global-treaty-needed-to-protect-states-from-pandemics-say-world-leaders;2021-03-29;Global treaty needed to protect states from pandemics, say world leaders;"Joint letter signed by Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and others warns ‘nobody is safe until everyone is safe’
The world needs a global treaty for pandemics to protect states in the wake of Covid-19, akin to the settlement forged after the second world war, Boris Johnson and other world leaders have urged.
In a joint article published in newspapers across the world, leaders including the UK prime minister, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, warn that a future global pandemic is an inevitability and that Covid has served as “a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe”.
Escalating international tensions over vaccine supplies have led to calls for countries to abandon isolationism and nationalism, and come together to make way for a new era founded on principles like solidarity and cooperation.
The call comes from 24 world leaders, alongside the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and will appear in newspapers including the Telegraph in the UK, Le Monde in France and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany.
The leaders describe the pandemic as “the biggest challenge to the global community since the 1940s” and said that a settlement like the one formed after 1945 is needed to build cross-border cooperation before the next international health crisis.
In the joint article, they say: “At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear: to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism, and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security.”
A treaty on pandemics “should lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and cooperation within the international system and with its rules and norms”, the leaders go on.
Johnson has advocated for some time for a fresh and more collaborative global approach to pandemics. Last month, he petitioned fellow G7 leaders to back the proposal, emphasising the need for better international health data-sharing.
It followed concerns that China withheld information and access from global health inspectors as they investigated the origins of Covid-19 and how the virus spread.
The G7, made up of the world’s leading industrial nations and of which Johnson is president this year, agreed to explore the idea and is to discuss it further at a summit in Cornwall in June.
Johnson has also led calls for richer nations to give surplus vaccine supplies to the UN-led Covax system for distributing vaccines to poorer countries. The G7 is also moving towards providing financial support for developing countries whose economies have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/29/merkel-centralise-covid-response-states-lockdown;2021-03-29;Merkel threatens to centralise Covid response as some states refuse to act;"Chancellor complains her government does not yet have power to impose national lockdown
Angela Merkel has threatened to centralise Germany’s pandemic response as several of the country’s federal states refuse to implement an emergency brake mechanism on easing restrictions in spite of rapidly rising infection rates.
Interviewed on German television on Sunday night, the German chancellor complained that the political instruments to break a third wave of the virus, for example by imposing a strict nationwide lockdown, were currently not at her government’s disposal, speaking of a “turning point” in the management of the Covid-19 crisis.
Merkel fell short of spelling out how such a politically sensitive power grab could look, merely hinting at a tweaking of Germany’s pandemic law.
“We need action in the federal states,” the German leader said. “We need to take the appropriate measures very seriously. Some states are doing it; others are not yet doing it.”
Decentralisation was one of the allied occupation of Germany’s four guiding principles after the second world war, alongside denazification, demilitarisation and democratisation: executive power was to be spread out across 16 federal states to prevent a historically aggressive nation from starting another war.
But in the fight against a virus the country’s federal structures have proved increasingly prohibitive, with some of the 16 Länder straying from red lines agreed at the monthly video conference call that has become Germany’s central decision-making forum.
Less hierarchically tilted towards the national capital than that of the United States, German federalism enables states to enact requirements that differ from national guidelines in fields including health and education.
The small state of Saarland on the border with France, for example, is unilaterally planning to end its lockdown measures after Easter and reopen sports and entertainment venues.
The large western state of North-Rhine Westphalia, governed by the new head of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party Armin Laschet, announced on Friday that shops would stay open in some municipalities in spite of infection rates surpassing the critical benchmark of 100 infections per 100,000 people within seven days.
Using veiled diplomatic language, Merkel used Sunday’s interview with the broadcaster Anne Will to chide Laschet, who hopes to represent the CDU in the race for national elections in September this year: her colleague’s interpretation of the rules, she said, “doesn’t fill me with joy”.
Markus Söder, the Bavarian state premier who is mooted as the German conservatives’ alternative chancellor candidate, was meanwhile quick off the blocks to lend his support to Merkel’s pro-lockdown stance, telling the news programme Tagesthemen on Sunday night he could imagine assigning the national state more power to “enforce clear rules” via an amendment of the pandemic law.
To impose a nationwide law or ban, a German chancellor must usually obtain unanimous consent from the states. Some constitutional experts argue that Germany’s basic law already does allow Merkel to impose a lockdown as a “measure against dangerous communicable disease among animals and humans”.
But such a move would be politically and legally risky and at odds with the consensual style Merkel has practised for the last 16 years.
German federalism, which is rooted in the country’s organisational structures of the 19th century but was suspended during the Third Reich, is fiercely protected by constitutional court in Karlsruhe and cherished across the political divide. Even Alexander Gauland, the co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland’s parliamentary group, argued in the Bundestag last week that “decentralisation is the command of the hour” in pandemic times.
During the first wave of the virus last spring, federalism was credited with leading to a high compliance with lockdown rules. In her interview on Sunday, Merkel merely said she was “still thinking about” how the federal states could be brought in line."

Angela Merkel likes to say there is no alternative to her policies; and when she does make U-turns, she tends not to admit to them. So it was highly unusual when last week, amid growing anger about her government’s response to the pandemic, the chancellor apologised to the German people. The government had planned to put the country in a tight lockdown for five days over Easter in an attempt to curb the sharp rise in infections, but abandoned the idea after it was widely criticised.
In the early phase of the pandemic, Germany seemed to stand out as one of the few western democracies that had handled it relatively successfully. A chorus of commentators attributed this to Merkel herself and in particular to her technocratic approach, based on her background as a scientist. By contrast, they saw other countries such as the UK and the US, where “populist” leaders were in power, as mishandling the crisis.
Now, however, the roles have been reversed. Of course, the pandemic is far from over and things could change again – for example, if, as expected, vaccine rollout slows in the UK as it accelerates sharply in the EU. But for the moment, as Germany struggles with a third wave with only 14% of its citizens vaccinated, it is the UK that is seen as the success story. Earlier this month, the editor of the German tabloid Bild even ran a front page that told Brits: “We envy you!”
The current moment is the latest episode in an ongoing struggle between technocracy and populism in Europe. For the past decade, Europe has been engulfed by what has frequently but misleadingly been called a populist “wave”. But the rise of populism can itself be understood as a response to the expansion of depoliticised decision making, in particular within the EU, the ultimate model of technocratic governance. Thus, there is a kind of dialectical relationship between technocracy and populism: technocracy creates populism, which in turn leads to more technocracy in response, and so on.
A year ago, the pandemic created what might be called a technocratic moment. Suddenly, it seemed as if life and death depended on competence and expertise – and many “pro-Europeans” hoped this had discredited populism once and for all. For example, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote last April that the pandemic “brings expertise and knowledge into sharp focus – principles that the populists mock or reject as they associate all of those qualities with the elite”. Thus, it was an opportunity to double down on technocracy.
During the first phase of the pandemic, the EU seemed to be strengthened. But now things look different. The economic and institutional problems around the euro had already damaged the EU’s reputation for competence during the past decade. Now the vaccine fiasco has undermined the perception that it is efficient in an even more dramatic way. The economist Paul Krugman wrote that the EU had demonstrated “the same bureaucratic and intellectual rigidity that made the euro crisis a decade ago far worse than it should have been”.
This is particularly damaging for the EU because of its long reliance on what political scientists call “output legitimacy” (that is, the legitimacy that comes from producing results) as a substitute for “input legitimacy” (that is, democracy). The damage to its reputation for competence further highlights its “democratic deficit”. At the same time, a much-vaunted Conference on the Future of Europe, which was originally meant to include citizens and find ways to democratise the EU, has degenerated into a power struggle between the existing institutions.
What all this means for the future of the EU is not yet clear. In Germany during the last month or so, there has been a wave of criticism of the EU and in particular the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, though the target of the criticism seems increasingly to be Berlin rather than Brussels. But even as Merkel’s Christian Democrats have plummeted in the polls and performed disastrously in two regional elections last weekend, this has not benefited the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which was formed in 2013 in response to Merkel’s politics of no alternatives.
Meanwhile, in a general election in the Netherlands 10 days ago, the centre-right prime minister, Mark Rutte, won a fourth consecutive term despite the fact that the country has been even slower than Germany to vaccinate its citizens. The big winner in the election was the liberal pro-European D66 party. But Thierry Baudet’s far-right Forum for Democracy also did well, increasing its seats in the Dutch parliament from two to eight, in part through its opposition to lockdown measures.
In Italy, the pandemic seems, if anything, to have increased rather than decreased support for the EU. Initially, there was a surge of Euroscepticism as Italy was hit hard by Covid-19 and received little support from the EU. But Italians welcomed the suspension of the EU’s fiscal rules, which limit government deficits and debt and have been at the centre of disputes within the eurozone. The creation of a €750bn (£645bn) EU recovery fund – the “NextGenerationEU” – restored the hope of many Italians in the union. Its recent threat to restrict the export of vaccines to countries such as the UK also seems to have gone down well.
However, the far-right Lega remains the most popular party in Italy, even if for the moment it has moderated its Euroscepticism as it backs the new government of the former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, an interesting fusion of technocracy and populism. Meanwhile, according to some polls, another far-right party, Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, is now the second most popular party after the Lega and could become even stronger as it opposes the Draghi government.
The next phase of the pandemic could further boost populism and reopen the conflicts within the EU that have emerged during the last decade since the euro crisis began. Europeans are starting to discuss how and when to return to the EU’s fiscal rules or, in EU jargon, how to “deactivate the escape clause”. The current ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said recently that she hoped the rules would be “revisited and improved”, but the question of how exactly to do that sets fiscally hawkish countries such as Germany and the Netherlands against countries such as Italy that want more flexibility.
The politics of the recovery fund, which was meant to restore cohesion within the EU, could also be toxic. EU member states have to submit national spending plans for approval to the European commission. It was this question of how to spend EU money that led to the collapse of the previous Italian government, a coalition including the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic party, in January. Meanwhile, on Friday, the German constitutional court blocked the German president from ratifying the fund after Bernd Lucke, the founder of the AfD, challenged its legality.
When the recovery fund was created last summer, pro-Europeans saw it as a breakthrough in European integration, hence its hubristic name. They saw it as a step towards debt mutualisation in the eurozone, or even, as the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, put it, a “Hamiltonian moment” that would inexorably lead towards the creation of a fiscal and political union such as the US. But this is what the German constitutional court opposes, as it has made clear in a series of rulings in the last decade.
Economists, on the other hand, are generally sceptical about the fund, which they see as inadequate in macroeconomic terms, particularly when compared with the $1.9tn fiscal stimulus that the US Congress has recently passed. Yet though it may not be big enough to produce a real recovery, the fund is big enough to create conflicts between member states over how to spend it – and to galvanise Eurosceptic parties in both the north and south of Europe. In short, the pandemic is unlikely to end the populist “wave”, as many centrists hoped last year.

But the rise of populism can itself be understood as a response to the expansion of depoliticised decision making, in particular within the EU, the ultimate model of technocratic governance. Thus, there is a kind of dialectical relationship between technocracy and populism: technocracy creates populism, which in turn leads to more technocracy in response, and so on.
A year ago, the pandemic created what might be called a technocratic moment. Suddenly, it seemed as if life and death depended on competence and expertise – and many “pro-Europeans” hoped this had discredited populism once and for all. For example, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote last April that the pandemic “brings expertise and knowledge into sharp focus – principles that the populists mock or reject as they associate all of those qualities with the elite”. Thus, it was an opportunity to double down on technocracy.
During the first phase of the pandemic, the EU seemed to be strengthened. But now things look different. The economic and institutional problems around the euro had already damaged the EU’s reputation for competence during the past decade. Now the vaccine fiasco has undermined the perception that it is efficient in an even more dramatic way. The economist Paul Krugman wrote that the EU had demonstrated “the same bureaucratic and intellectual rigidity that made the euro crisis a decade ago far worse than it should have been”.
This is particularly damaging for the EU because of its long reliance on what political scientists call “output legitimacy” (that is, the legitimacy that comes from producing results) as a substitute for “input legitimacy” (that is, democracy). The damage to its reputation for competence further highlights its “democratic deficit”. At the same time, a much-vaunted Conference on the Future of Europe, which was originally meant to include citizens and find ways to democratise the EU, has degenerated into a power struggle between the existing institutions.
What all this means for the future of the EU is not yet clear. In Germany during the last month or so, there has been a wave of criticism of the EU and in particular the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, though the target of the criticism seems increasingly to be Berlin rather than Brussels. But even as Merkel’s Christian Democrats have plummeted in the polls and performed disastrously in two regional elections last weekend, this has not benefited the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which was formed in 2013 in response to Merkel’s politics of no alternatives.
Meanwhile, in a general election in the Netherlands 10 days ago, the centre-right prime minister, Mark Rutte, won a fourth consecutive term despite the fact that the country has been even slower than Germany to vaccinate its citizens. The big winner in the election was the liberal pro-European D66 party. But Thierry Baudet’s far-right Forum for Democracy also did well, increasing its seats in the Dutch parliament from two to eight, in part through its opposition to lockdown measures.
In Italy, the pandemic seems, if anything, to have increased rather than decreased support for the EU. Initially, there was a surge of Euroscepticism as Italy was hit hard by Covid-19 and received little support from the EU. But Italians welcomed the suspension of the EU’s fiscal rules, which limit government deficits and debt and have been at the centre of disputes within the eurozone. The creation of a €750bn (£645bn) EU recovery fund – the “NextGenerationEU” – restored the hope of many Italians in the union. Its recent threat to restrict the export of vaccines to countries such as the UK also seems to have gone down well.
However, the far-right Lega remains the most popular party in Italy, even if for the moment it has moderated its Euroscepticism as it backs the new government of the former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, an interesting fusion of technocracy and populism. Meanwhile, according to some polls, another far-right party, Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, is now the second most popular party after the Lega and could become even stronger as it opposes the Draghi government.
The next phase of the pandemic could further boost populism and reopen the conflicts within the EU that have emerged during the last decade since the euro crisis began. Europeans are starting to discuss how and when to return to the EU’s fiscal rules or, in EU jargon, how to “deactivate the escape clause”. The current ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said recently that she hoped the rules would be “revisited and improved”, but the question of how exactly to do that sets fiscally hawkish countries such as Germany and the Netherlands against countries such as Italy that want more flexibility.
The politics of the recovery fund, which was meant to restore cohesion within the EU, could also be toxic. EU member states have to submit national spending plans for approval to the European commission. It was this question of how to spend EU money that led to the collapse of the previous Italian government, a coalition including the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic party, in January. Meanwhile, on Friday, the German constitutional court blocked the German president from ratifying the fund after Bernd Lucke, the founder of the AfD, challenged its legality.
When the recovery fund was created last summer, pro-Europeans saw it as a breakthrough in European integration, hence its hubristic name. They saw it as a step towards debt mutualisation in the eurozone, or even, as the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, put it, a “Hamiltonian moment” that would inexorably lead towards the creation of a fiscal and political union such as the US. But this is what the German constitutional court opposes, as it has made clear in a series of rulings in the last decade.
Economists, on the other hand, are generally sceptical about the fund, which they see as inadequate in macroeconomic terms, particularly when compared with the $1.9tn fiscal stimulus that the US Congress has recently passed. Yet though it may not be big enough to produce a real recovery, the fund is big enough to create conflicts between member states over how to spend it – and to galvanise Eurosceptic parties in both the north and south of Europe. In short, the pandemic is unlikely to end the populist “wave”, as many centrists hoped last year.

Angela Merkel likes to say there is no alternative to her policies; and when she does make U-turns, she tends not to admit to them. So it was highly unusual when last week, amid growing anger about her government’s response to the pandemic, the chancellor apologised to the German people. The government had planned to put the country in a tight lockdown for five days over Easter in an attempt to curb the sharp rise in infections, but abandoned the idea after it was widely criticised.
In the early phase of the pandemic, Germany seemed to stand out as one of the few western democracies that had handled it relatively successfully. A chorus of commentators attributed this to Merkel herself and in particular to her technocratic approach, based on her background as a scientist. By contrast, they saw other countries such as the UK and the US, where “populist” leaders were in power, as mishandling the crisis.
Now, however, the roles have been reversed. Of course, the pandemic is far from over and things could change again – for example, if, as expected, vaccine rollout slows in the UK as it accelerates sharply in the EU. But for the moment, as Germany struggles with a third wave with only 14% of its citizens vaccinated, it is the UK that is seen as the success story. Earlier this month, the editor of the German tabloid Bild even ran a front page that told Brits: “We envy you!”

In December, two weeks before the European Medicines Agency authorised the first vaccine against Covid-19 for use across the European Union, Berlin unveiled a plan to rocket-fuel its immunisation drive with German precision engineering. Jabs would be mass-administered in purpose-built vaccination centres where patients could be shuttled through queuing lanes like cars through a car wash.
A Lego display demonstrating the complex system’s efficiency impressed journalists at a press launch, but set off alarm bells in the head of Janosch Dahmen, a former doctor turned Green party MP. “It all looked very logical in theory,” says Dahmen, who worked on the pandemic frontline until November. “But looking at it as a doctor, I thought: that’s not how vaccinations work in practice.
“You want your grandmother to get a call from the family doctor who has been treating her for 20 years and tells her not to worry about those side-effects she has heard of on the radio. People are not cars.”
Three months on, the alarm bells are ringing loud enough for the whole of Germany to hear.
Last spring, at the start of the pandemic, the country looked like a role model for how to deal with the viral threat. It was managing to contain outbreaks thanks to a high rate of testing and an advanced contact-tracing system. In mid-April, its case fatality rate for Covid-19 infections was less than 3%, compared with 14% in the UK and 13% in France, in spite of a lockdown that was softer than elsewhere on the continent. Levels of compliance were high, as were the government’s approval ratings.
Yet on Friday the head of Germany’s disease control agency warned that the country was heading for a third wave of the pandemic that was likely to be its worst one yet, while the government looked lost for answers, U-turning within 48 hours on a strict Easter lockdown plan without offering alternative restrictions in its place.
Frustration runs high with a complex, ever harder to follow patchwork of rules, issued following increasingly acrimonious video conferences between Angela Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 federal states.
Worst of all, the immunisation hyperdrive remains stuck in first gear: 90 days since the first jab was administered, only 10% of Germany’s population have received their first dose, compared with 42% in the UK and 26% in the US. Even France, once seen as Europe’s vaccine laggard, has given a higher share of its population a first dose than Germany.
From the outside, Germany’s relatively successful management of the pandemic’s first wave was often linked to the wise decision-making of its chancellor, a trained quantum chemist who could calmly explain complex scientific calculations where other leaders reached for martial metaphors.
“Macron’s response to the pandemic was ‘Nous sommes en guerre,’” said Andreas Rödder, a historian at the university of Mainz. “Merkel’s was: ‘Remember to wash your mask at 60 degrees.’”
Seen from inside Germany, both the country’s early victories and current malaise were more easily explained by structural factors, cultural priorities and a degree of fortune – good in 2020, less so in 2021.
When Germany imposed its first lockdown on 22 March last year, it was lucky that, unlike in Italy, the virus had not yet silently spread around the country and into care homes for the elderly. In the highly decentralised country, Covid-19 also came up against a political system that was surprisingly well-placed to cope with the initial challenges.
With health one of the policy areas devolved to the country’s federal states, Germany had more than 400 local health authorities that were already experienced in running contact-tracing schemes. And a competitive network of regional university and private laboratories gave the country a head start on testing.
“German federalism in its current form may historically have been designed as a straitjacket for a notoriously aggressive state,” said Siegfried Weichlein, a historian of federalism at the university of Freiburg. “But it is a popular straitjacket. At its best, as we saw at the start of the pandemic, it is a dynamic system that can lead to a competition to the top and a higher average acceptance of political decisions.”
By some measures, Germany still excels: its relative pandemic death toll remains considerably lower than in comparable western European states such as France or the UK. But the fear of losing face in the immunisation race has come to dominate the national conversation.
A joint procurement programme that placed too much faith in the wrong vaccine candidates has created supply shortfalls across the EU. Yet Europe’s largest economy has been slow to administer even the doses it has got its hands on, injecting vaccines into people’s arms at a slower rate than 13 other EU states.
Germany’s stockpile of unused vaccines had grown to 3.5 million doses by the start of last week – partially, but not just, because the health ministry insists on holding between 20% and 50% of doses for the second jab, depending on the manufacturer.
In some cases, the immunisation drive has seen the positives of federalism converted into negatives. The western city of Wuppertal announced on Wednesday that it was left with 2,000 unused doses of vaccine, because it had finished inoculating all residents aged over 80, but had been stopped from moving on to the next age group by the authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia, which wanted the entire state to move in sync.
Far from seeing a race to the top, the immunisation programme had created a scenario were “the laggards are setting the pace”, as the head of the city’s crisis taskforce put it.
“Whether you are dealing with a bleeding patient or with a pandemic: speed trumps perfection,” Dahmen told the Observer. “In Germany, we tried to reinvent the wheel with the vaccine rollout, to perfect a system before we put it into practice. That kind of thoroughness is now becoming self-defeating.”
The rationale behind running the programme solely through vaccine centres, Dahmen said, was partly that mRNA vaccines like BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna were thought to require high-tech storage facilities, but also out of a fear of too much decentralisation: family doctors, authorities worried, might have been tempted to stray from the priority order and administer precious jabs to private patients or friends instead.
Without using GPs, each German state has had to build its own system for finding the right people in the right age groups for a jab appointment, with some inviting patients by letter, while others rely on being contacted via overburdened hotlines and creaky online portals. In Lower Saxony, authorities used post office records to seek out candidates for the first round of jabs, guessing people’s ages on the basis of their first names.
These woes may be locally made, but public anger is now also arriving at the doorstep of the chancellory in Berlin. Cautious pragmatism has served Merkel well throughout most of her 15 years in power. But among a 90% unvaccinated public, many are now calling for bolder leadership.
Hopes that Germany’s doctors’ practices could soon join in the vaccination effort were dashed earlier this month when the vaccine authority recommended a temporary halt on using the AstraZeneca jab over reports of blood-clot disorders in a small number of recipients.
Contrary to some speculation in Britain, Merkel’s decision to heed the regulator’s advice had little to do with attempts to politicise the vaccine developed in Oxford University. Rather, it was the opposite: an affirmation of the belief that a cut-no-corners bureaucratic management culture can still win out against the virus. Not pausing the rollout of the vaccine in spite of the medical regulator’s caution would have constituted political action – but a risk that many Germans would have forgiven their chancellor for taking.
“Instead of making a mistake, it seems, we preferred to stand still,” said ex-doctor Dahmen. “If you want an effective crisis management, fear of committing errors is a toxic attitude.”"

EU leaders are likely to shy away from supporting the use of new powers to block Covid vaccine shipments to countries with better jab coverage such as the UK, according to a draft statement before a meeting of the bloc’s heads of state and government..
The European commission has increased its scope for blocking vaccine exports but disquiet among member states is set to be reflected in a muted statement at the end of the virtual summit on Thursday evening.
The latest draft summit conclusion has leaders underlining “the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations”.
Countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium and Sweden, who are concerned about the impact on supply chains, have pushed back against any explicit reference to the commission’s revised regulation.
The commission will keep its new powers despite the lack of explicit backing from the leaders, but diplomatic sources from within the most sceptical member states said they hoped the “stick will never be used”.
Speaking in the Bundestag, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, notably did not reference the new powers but instead called on Europe to increase domestic vaccine production given the lack of exports from the UK and the US, describing the pandemic as a “great litmus test” of the EU’s capabilities.
“The problem at the moment with the vaccine supply isn’t so much due to the question how much was ordered, but more about how much can be manufactured on European soil,” she said.
“Because we can clearly see: British manufacturing plants manufacture for Great Britain, the US aren’t exporting anything, and therefore we rely on what can be produced in Europe and we have to expect this virus will preoccupy us for a long time.”
On Wednesday the commission updated its export authorisation mechanism to allow officials to block shipments to countries with a high level of vaccination coverage or those that restrict exports through law or in their contracts with suppliers.
The UK does not ban the export of vaccines, but the government signed a contract with AstraZeneca that obliges the Anglo-Swedish company to deliver doses produced in Oxford and Staffordshire to Britain first.
The UK also appears to fall foul of the EU’s new criteria on vaccination coverage, with 45 jabs administered per 100 residents compared with 13 per 100 on average across the 27 member states.
The regulation, in force since January, previously only took into account whether a supplier was fulfilling its contract with the EU.
The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, rejected claims that the bloc was being protectionist. “We have a feeling that the vaccine nationalism is really on the other side of the Channel,” he told the Financial Times. “We are not seeing any vaccines in the UK arriving here.”
The EU has suffered from a major supply shortfall of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine because of a yield problem at a plant in Belgium and the company’s subsequent refusal to divert doses made in the UK.
The EU is threatening to block the export to the UK of an unspecified number of doses being made at an AstraZeneca plant in the Netherlands.
UK officials have been in negotiations since Monday on the issue. In a joint statement on Wednesday evening, the two sides said they were continuing to seek a “win-win” solution.
Breton told ambassadors on Wednesday that the UK’s interest in the jabs in the Netherlands was particularly acute as the government had not stockpiled vaccine for second doses, leaving them in need of production from Europe to fully vaccinate those administered with a first jab.

Angela Merkel has taken the unusual step of issuing a personal apology to the nation as she performed a U-turn on plans to put Germany under a hard lockdown over Easter following a critical backlash.
Addressing the public at a press conference on Wednesday morning, the German chancellor said the plan to close churches and shops over a five-day period had been her mistake, “and mistakes should be called out as such”.
The reversal came as Belgium reintroduced strict lockdown measures in response to a surge of new coronavirus infections. The government announced that schools would be closed on Monday and residents would have only limited access to non-essential businesses from Wednesday night. Non-essential shops will remain open but customers will need to book appointments. Hairdressers and beauty salons must close until 25 April.
The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said the variant first identified in Britain was likely to be behind cases increasing 40% in the last week and hospital admissions rising 28% after a long period of relative stability.
In Germany, Merkel said she regretted that her proposal had caused further uncertainty and asked for forgiveness from the public, whose growing frustration with the government’s cumbersome decision-making and glacial vaccine rollout is threatening to damage her party before national elections in September.
Following an acrimonious summit between the chancellor and the heads of Germany’s 16 federal states on Monday, Merkel had announced an extension of the partial lockdown until 18 April, as well as a tightening of restrictions from 1-5 April designed to “break the exponential growth of the third wave”.
The proposals were immediately questioned by epidemiologists, business associations and members of Merkel’s own political bloc.
Under the planned Easter lockdown, all shops and business would have been told to remain shut for five days in a row, while grocery stores were to briefly reopen on Holy Saturday, a proposal that many feared would lead to crowded aisles and super-spreader events in supermarket queues.
Business associations were dismayed, with the president of the German Automotive Industry Association warning it was “unimaginable” to put entire factories on halt in an international networked industry.
Merkel’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, of the Christian Social Union (CSU), criticised the request for churches to hold Easter services online.
The chancellor scheduled an emergency conference call with the heads of the federal states on Wednesday morning in which she conceded that the Easter lockdown had been a mistake.
“If possible, we should correct it in time,” German media reported as saying during the call. “I believe it’s still possible.”
Without the Easter lockdown, critics said, it was unclear what concrete steps the government was taking to stem a third wave of the pandemic, other than through a broad appeal for people to stay within their own four walls as much as possible.
Of other decisions announced on Tuesday, an emergency brake on further reopenings that will apply to areas exceeding 100 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a seven-day period remains in place.
Germany, which has been stuck in partial lockdown for over more than four months, has in recent weeks recorded a new rise of cases driven by the more infectious B.1.1.7 variant, which currently makes up more than half of new cases reported in the country.
Infection rates in Germany are still considerably lower than in countries such as France, Italy or Poland, but scientists says failure to curb the pandemic’s growth now could mean hospitals being overwhelmed with new cases by April.
With only 9.5 % of the population having received a jab so far, vaccine-led immunity levels remain too low to halt a third wave at this stage.
Public anger with the slow vaccination rollout and an ever-changing patchwork of restrictions is increasingly directed at Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), whose support in the polls ballooned last spring but has now fallen back to pre-pandemic levels.
A survey by the pollster Forsa published on Wednesday showed the CDU clinging on to first place at 26% but the second-placed Greens in a kingmaker role, with governing alliances with the Social Democrats (SPD), Free Democratic party (FDP) or the leftwing Die Linke all within a touching distance of a majority.
Merkel’s unusually honest apology is likely to win her respect and sympathy, but may not stave off an electoral defeat in the coming months.
Her plan for a Easter circuit-breaker lockdown was meant to be the kind of spectacular measure that would reassert her authority, the weekly Die Zeit wrote. “Instead, she now looks like an amateur who pushes through proposals that sound impressive but haven’t been thought through.”
The leftwing daily taz said Wednesday’s U-turn had confirmed Merkel’s status as a lame-duck chancellor. “The Easter break idea came across as chaotic and crude, and the hasty volte-face 36 hours later doesn’t change that. It looks just as chaotic and crude,” it said."

Germany is “in a new pandemic” in which the British Covid variant is dominant, Angela Merkel has said, as she announced a strict shutdown over Easter to halt soaring infection rates.
Merkel said the country was in a “very serious” situation and was racing to get vaccinations done. Social gatherings would be limited over Easter, with 1 - 5 April designated “quiet days” when no more than five adults from two households will be able to meet at home at once.
“We are now basically in a new pandemic. The British mutation has become dominant,” Merkel said at a news conference on Monday night.
Merkel said she was against “general export bans” on vaccines while also voicing support for EU chief Ursula von der Leyen’s threat to block AstraZeneca vaccines produced in the bloc from being exported, ahead of a crunch EU summit on Thursday on the escalating row.
“I support Commission President Ursula von der Leyen,” said Merkel. “We have a problem with AstraZeneca,” she added. “We will decide responsibly.”
In a warning to the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant last Saturday, von der Leyen said: “That’s the message to AstraZeneca: you fulfil your contract with Europe first before you start delivering to other countries.”
The new restrictions in Germany come as the World Health Organization (WHO) said the weekly global count of deaths from Covid-19 was rising again after about six weeks of declines.
Merkel said people should stay at home over the extended Easter period and that for most of that time, only food shops will be open. Churches will be asked to hold services online only.
“The situation is serious. Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again,” said Merkel.
Merkel’s words were echoed by Markus Söder, the premier of Bavaria, who said: “We are now in the most dangerous phase of the pandemic.”
The chancellor had been meeting leaders of Germany’s 16 states in what were supposed to be talks about a further easting of restrictions, but instead agreed to pause the planned reopening of bars, restaurants, leisure and cultural venues until 18 April.
Before the meeting, the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases reported that case levels had passed a key marker.
The number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants hit 107 on Monday, above the 100 threshold at which it is deemed that Germany’s intensive care units will no longer be able to cope. On Tuesday, the country recorded nearly 7,500 fresh cases and 250 more deaths, taking the cumulative totals to 2,674,710 cases and 74,964 fatalities.
Under the new restrictions, staff who can work from home will be asked to continue doing so until 18 April rather than return to the workplace on 28 March.
Merkel said the government was advising against all travel abroad and had agreed with airlines that returnees should be tested before flying.
The leaders agreed to “appeal urgently to all citizens to refrain from non-essential travel within the country and also abroad – also with regard to the upcoming Easter holidays”.
The country had successfully suppressed infections over the summer, but by early January cases had risen dramatically, with more than 15% of tests returning positive readings on 3 January. Measures again reduced them by mid February and schools reopened at the end of February, followed by hairdressers and some shops and businesses in March.
Germany’s new measures came as a top WHO expert said the weekly global count of deaths from Covid-19 was rising again, a “worrying sign” after about six weeks of declines.
Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead on Covid-19 at the UN health agency, said the growth followed a fifth straight week of confirmed cases increasing worldwide.
She said the number of reported cases went up in four of the WHO’s six regions, though there were significant variations within each region.
“In the last week, cases have increased by 8% per cent,” Van Kerkhove said. “In Europe, that is 12% – and that’s driven by several countries.” The increase was due in part to the spread of a variant that first emerged in Britain and is now circulating in many other places, including eastern Europe, she said.
Asked about the rising number of cases in Europe, where some states are reimposing tighter restrictions, fearing a third wave of the pandemic, WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said countries had missed an open goal.
He said nations were grasping at straws, thinking that simply administering lots of vaccine doses would be a “golden solution” to end the crisis. “I’m sorry: it’s not,” Ryan said.
EU leaders will meet virtually on Thursday to discuss the Covid crisis, and to consider blocking the export of vaccines out of the block.

The German-backed Nord Stream pipeline is “a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security”, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has warned.
The claim on Thursday is likely to send a chill through US-German relations, as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has repeatedly claimed the near-complete project – a system of offshore natural gas pipelines – should be seen as an economic rather than political project. Merkel has invested huge political capital in defending the project.
With the pipeline so close to completion there had been an expectation that the US would feel the issue was a lost cause, but Blinken said in a statement that firms involved in the project should immediately abandon work or face sanctions.
He said the Biden administration was intent on complying with existing bipartisan Congress legislation that calls for sanctions against those working on the project. He said the US was tracking those entities believed to be involved in the project.
The Baltic Sea pipeline that bypasses Ukraine – so depriving the country of significant revenues – is 90% complete and could even be operational by June.
Blinken’s warning came the day after the US president, Joe Biden, called the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a killer, a description that prompted the latter to withdraw his ambassador to Washington.
Some Republican senators, such as Ted Cruz, have been threatening to disrupt nominations for key administration posts unless the Biden team toughens up its stance on Nord Stream.
In its final days the Trump administration had been planning to go as far as sanctioning German entities for their role in the project, former officials said. Those entities included Nord Stream’s German CEO, Matthias Warnig, and the German vessel Krebs Geo. The US has imposed sanctions on the Russian company KVT-RUS, which operates the Fortuna lay ship.
There has also been anger in Ukraine that the new administration has not acted more decisively, and even now some in Kiev will note that, despite the tough language, no sanctions have been applied. In a bid to assuage the US, Merkel is due to offer extra economic help to Ukraine this week for the expansion of green hydrogen.
“The perception in Ukraine and most of Europe is that US sanctions are intentionally not being implemented in order to allow the Kremlin to finish Nord Stream 2,” said Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of Ukraine’s Energy Industry Research Centre. “It’s hard to believe that this is what president Biden wants, but by choosing not to apply US sanctions laws and refusing to sanction the numerous vessels and companies openly engaging in pipe laying, this amounts to a policy of protecting Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline.”
German industrialists have been adamant in their support for the pipeline and say US objections reflect American business interests and not any genuine geopolitical fear that Europe could become over-reliant on Russia for energy."

Over the past decade, many of Europe’s centre-left parties have been battered, bruised and not infrequently humiliated at elections. In France, the Socialist party languishes at below 10% in the polls. The Dutch Labour party underwent a near-death experience at the general election of 2017. Italy’s Democrats have lost swaths of working-class support to the populist right and were at one point eclipsed by the Five Star Movement. Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) has slipped badly behind the Greens. Soul-searching about the future of the left has not been confined to Britain and Labour.
This week, elections in the Netherlands are likely to see the dismal record continue. The Labour party is predicted to improve only modestly on its dire performance of four years ago, when it lost 75% of the seats it held. But the weekend offered the first tentative signs that, after the wilderness years, the wheel of political fortune may just be turning for Europe’s beleaguered social democrats.
It would be premature to read too much into the disastrous performance of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party at two state elections, where it scored its worst-ever results. Both regions were already controlled by political opponents – Rhineland-Palatinate by the Social Democrats and Baden-Württemberg by the Greens. The results were also heavily influenced by Covid-related factors, from the slow rollout of the vaccination programme, to corruption claims involving alleged kickbacks to CDU politicians from mask procurement deals. The eventual impact of these issues on September’s general election is difficult to predict.
Nevertheless, this was a damaging setback for the European Union’s most powerful and successful centre-right party. Suddenly, the CDU appears vulnerable, despite its sizeable lead in national polls. As chancellor Angela Merkel prepares to step down, a new three-way coalition – between the Greens, the SPD and the liberal Free Democrats - has emerged as a genuine possibility. For the SPD, which has haemorrhaged support while serving as junior partner in a CDU-led grand coalition, this would represent a road to renewal and rehabilitation. Meanwhile in Italy, the Democratic party’s new leader, Enrico Letta, has also been talking up the possibility of a future centre-left alliance. At the last election, in 2018, the Democrats fought, and lost, alone. On Sunday, Mr Letta hinted at a first electoral pact with the environmentally-friendly Five Star Movement.
Such alliances can take advantage of an ideological sea-change. Following the financial crash of 2008, the European centre-left paid a calamitous price for enacting the EU economic orthodoxy of austerity. Social democrats ran or participated in governments associated with cutting state spending and lowering the living standards of the less well-off. Their number included Mr Letta, prime minister of Italy from 2013 to 2014. But the twin challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate emergency have buried that old consensus. The EU’s €750bn Covid recovery fund, its largest-ever stimulus package, has itself been dwarfed in scale by the Biden administration’s $1.9tn equivalent. Big government is making a comeback, driven by the urgent need for green investment to meet slipping climate targets, and the priority of ensuring post-Covid economic growth.
The map of political priorities is thus being re-drawn in a way that should be meat and drink to parties that lost their way in the 2010s. The road to redemption for the traditional centre-left will depend on forging new alliances, particularly with the newly influential green movement. The weekend, in a very small way, was a start."

Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats face questions over their new leader and the impact of a corruption scandal involving face mask production following historic defeats in German regional elections on Sunday – just six months before a national vote.
Merkel’s successor as chancellor is due to be chosen by the voters in September and the CDU’s worst ever results in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, which were once considered its strongholds, have increased pressure on the party to work out how it can regain the confidence of the public in time.
In the wealthy southern state of Baden-Württemberg, the CDU’s result slumped to just 24%, way behind its main rival, the pro-environmental Greens, who made gains to secure 33%. The CDU had previously ruled the state from 1953 for almost 58 years.
In Rhineland-Palatinate, south-western Germany, the CDU vote fell by more than four points to 28%, with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) securing victory with 36%.
The CDU has had to face up to the fact that a corruption scandal involving alleged kickbacks over face mask procurement, which led to the resignation of three MPs within a week, in the run-up to the votes, has seriously damaged its image. On Monday it hinted at plans it would refresh an existing “codex” under which MPs have to make public their allegiances to business and any other interest groups.
A sluggish nationwide vaccine rollout, which has been largely blamed on the decision by Merkel and her health minister, Jens Spahn, to allow the European commission to take control of orders, is also thought to have contributed to voter distrust. So far only about 3.3% of Germans have received the full vaccination, and 7.4% have had the first jab. These figures are far lower than those for the US, where 11% have been fully vaccinated and 21% have had the first injection, and Britain, where only 2.4% have been fully vaccinated, but 36% have had their first jab.
The fact that the CDU has returned such historically bad results, which have plunged the party into its worst crisis for years two months after electing a new party leader, Armin Laschet, has raised serious questions as to whether he is the right candidate to take it forward.
On Monday afternoon, Laschet admitted at a press conference the results were disappointing, and called on the members of his party to “pull together” ahead of September’s poll, saying: “We must fight.”
He said that among the “several reasons” for the slump, was the CDU’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “We need to improve our Coronavirus management,” he said.
Commentators on Monday said the lack of the so-called “Merkel bonus” the party enjoyed for years, owing to the popularity of the chancellor, who will not stand again in September, had also had an impact on the result.
Markus Söder, the head of the CDU’s sister party, the Christian Social Union, the leader of Bavaria and the federal interior minister, called the results a “heavy strike at the heart of the union”, blaming in large part the government’s strategy over the coronavirus, including the vaccination programme and a prolonged lockdown.
“The election results demonstrated scepticism towards the management of the crisis,” he said.
Basking in their party’s results, the co-leaders of the Greens, and potential candidates for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, said voters had demonstrated their trust in the Greens to govern and said that the pandemic had contributed to the party’s boost by highlighting deficits in governance.
“Many people have given their all during the pandemic,” Baerbock said at a press conference in Berlin. “They expected the government would do the same but they are disappointed ... that’s what the election results show.”
She said the Greens’ result in Baden-Württemberg in particular showed that people wanted a different sort of politics. It was time, she said, to shake up the country, arguing that many opportunities to modernise Europe’s largest economy had been ignored, citing in particular the need to update its often slow and clunky day-to-day administration processes.
“During the pandemic we’ve seen how the health authorities send faxes back and forth to each other,” she said, adding that the “make do and mend” approach had to change.
Sunday’s state elections kicked off what has been labelled “superwahljahr” or “super election year”, to include further votes in the state of Saxony-Anhalt in June, Lower Saxony and Berlin in September and culminating in the federal election on 26 September, together with elections in the states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia on the same day.
In both Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, the Greens, SPD, and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) are potentially in a position to forge “traffic light” alliances – so-called because of the parties’ colours – which would leave the CDU out in the cold. If managed successfully on a state level, it makes the constellation more likely on a national level."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/14/angela-merkel-cdu-party-historic-lows-state-elections;2021-03-14;Angela Merkel's CDU slumps to historic lows in former strongholds;"State election results could be sign tide is turning against conservatives as country gears up for national poll
Angela Merkel’s party has slumped to historic lows in two former stronghold regions at state elections, in a sign that the tide may be turning against Germany’s conservatives just as the country gears up for a national vote in six months’ time.
The incumbent Green premier of Baden-Württemberg and the Social Democrat leader of Rhineland-Palatinate both look certain to retain their offices in the two south-western states, after exit polls showed significant losses for the second-placed Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Sunday.
In wealthy Baden-Württemberg, where the CDU governed uninterruptedly until 2011, the conservatives may even no longer hold on to their place as junior coalition partner.
The Green premier, Winfried Kretschmann, could have the choice of either holding on to the current power-sharing deal with a weakened conservative party or entering a “traffic light” coalition with the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) in the home state of the carmakers Daimler and Porsche.
The same coalition arrangement is likely to stay in place for another term in Rhineland-Palatinate, where the premier, Malu Dreyer, managed to gain an impressive 35.7% of the vote in spite of her centre-left party’s struggle to maintain a profile as Merkel’s junior partner at a national level.
With a federal election looming on 26 September, the outcome in the two states will give a boost to the Green party, which is in second place behind the CDU in national polls and managed to increase its share of the vote by two to three percentage points in both states.
Through its only state premier in Kretschmann, the environmentalist party has shown it can be pragmatic and successful in government, rather than just rallying for change from the opposition benches.
The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) could not capitalise on being the only party to outright oppose the government’s lockdown course at a national level, and lost votes in both states.
The anti-immigration party remains at about 10% of the vote in both Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, however, in spite of being recently put under nationwide surveillance by the country’s domestic intelligence agency.
The vote is the first test of the leadership qualities of new CDU leader, Armin Laschet, who has been in his post for under two months but hopes to run as his party’s candidate for the chancellorship in September.
A sluggish vaccination rollout overseen by CDU ministers and a corruption scandal over kickbacks in mask procurement deals is likely to be blamed for the poor performance, but Laschet will face an uphill struggle convincing his conservative colleagues he has the necessary authority to improve his party’s battered image on the campaign trail."

Winfried Kretschmann, a white-haired former biology teacher who has been the state premier of Baden-Württemberg since 2011, can look forward to this Sunday’s elections in his wealthy corner of south-west Germany with ease.
In the home state of Daimler, Porsche and Bosch, he has not just won the support of the metal and electronics industry, but that of conservative voters, 65% of whom have in surveys expressed their wish for the 72-year-old Catholic to retain his office.
Posters plastered all over the state showcase not only Kretschmann’s trademark flat-top haircut but also a robust brass neck: his campaign slogan “Sie kennen mich” (You know me) is the same folksy quip that helped Angela Merkel win a third term in 2013.
The only problem for Merkel’s party is that Kretschmann is not a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), but the German Greens.
Seven months before the chancellor’s 16-year stint comes to an end with federal elections on 26 September, state votes in Baden-Württemberg and neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate could teach the German public a surprising lesson: that they can vote for a continuation of Merkelism not just without Merkel, but also without the CDU.
Since winning the leadership mandate in Germany’s top export state in 2011, Kretschmann has pursued an ambitious agenda on biodiversity while keeping local carmakers on side with the kind of pragmatic approach usually associated with the country’s famously consensual chancellor.
As journalist Ulrich Schulte puts it in a new book on the ecological party, Kretschmann’s south-western Greens have managed to become what the CDU once used to be and what the national Green party dreams of becoming: “an indispensable political force that represents and shapes the state like no other”.
While the latest polls in Baden-Württemberg give the Green party a 10-point lead, his Christian Democrat coalition partners could on Sunday not just face a historic defeat in their former stronghold, but also the possibility of being pushed out of office in favour of a “traffic-light coalition” between the Greens, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the pro-business Free Democrats.
Such a power-sharing arrangement is already in place in Rhineland-Palatinate, once the home turf of the late reunification chancellor Helmut Kohl but governed by centre-left premier Malu Dreyer since 2013. Here too, the Christian Democrats could be left out in the cold as a result of their polling lead having disappeared in the wake of kickback allegations over mask procurement deals and a growing frustration with a sluggish vaccination rollout overseen by CDU ministers.
For leader Armin Laschet, who has led the conservative outfit for less than two months but hopes to take Merkel’s mantle in September, the two state elections could provide a sobering reality check.
“The danger for Laschet is that his leadership qualities will come into question before he has fully settled in his job”, said Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University.
“After the votes on Sunday there will be strategic attempts to blame the mask affair and weak candidates”, Faas said. “But one thing is quite clear: the government’s ratings, and especially those of the CDU, only shot up because of the pandemic – and now they are going down again”.
How low the hegemon of German postwar politics can fall remains the great unknown. Recent polls still show the CDU as the strongest force in the country, at roughly the same share of the vote it received in 2017.
And whether the second-placed Green party under leadership duo Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck can simply take its place on the national stage by copying their success story in Baden-Württemberg is questionable.
“Kretschmann provides a blueprint for stealing a march on the Christian Democratic Union among the middle-class electorate”, Schulte wrote in a recent article for taz.
“But such a cautious course of modernisation is far too slow in the face of the escalating climate crisis; it would even fall short of an orientation on the Paris agreement, the minimal goal of a Green coalition government”.
Kretschmann’s consensual approach has involved compromises that have made the more leftwing quarters of his party wince, such as a proposal for a scrappage scheme to incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars, designed to support automobile companies struggling during the pandemic.
It has also created space for the foundation of a small new ecological party, Klimaliste Baden-Württemberg, which will compete for Green seats at Sunday’s vote.
Signalling too much of Kretschmann’s flexibility in the run-up to the September vote, some Green supporters fear, could damage the party’s standing just as they limber up to play a role in the next government.
They point a warning finger at Austria, where the Greens entered a power-sharing deal with chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives in 2020 but have been outmuscled in a symbolic battle over the country’s asylum policy. Instead of becoming Germany’s next indispensable political force, the Greens could also go down in history as the conservatives’ litter-bearers."

Corruption allegations and mounting frustration with Germany’s slow vaccination roll-out are threatening to damage Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in weather-vane state elections this Sunday, as the centre-right party is trying to distance itself from politicians whose companies are alleged to have made profits on the back of mask procurement deals.
In the south-western states of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, voters will go to the polls this weekend while digesting the allegations that one lawmaker from the CDU and one from its Bavarian sister-party, the CSU, earned six-figure commissions for brokering deals to procure face masks during last year’s first wave of the pandemic.
“This is exactly what voters have been waiting for,” wrote commentator Torsten Krauel in Die Welt newspaper. “While they went into lockdown and thousands of self-employed workers faced their ruin, delegates from the conservative bloc dealt with masks like in a bad movie.”
While state elections in Germany’s federalised system are more likely to be decided by regional than national dynamics, symbolic defeats for the Christian Democrats in two former strongholds could rein in new leader Armin Laschet’s ambition to lead his party into the national vote in September.
Even without the mask scandal, the CDU would not have been expected to emerge triumphant in wealthy Baden-Württemberg. In the home state of Daimler and Porsche, the conservative party comfortably won every election between 1953 and 2011 but has since struggled to maintain a profile against Winfried Kretschmann, a charismatic Green party politician steering a centrist course between ecological reforms and support for local business.
Yet recent polls put the CDU at a mere 24% of the vote, 11 percentage points behind the Greens and three behind its own disappointing 2016 result, suggesting the expected defeat could have a historically painful dimension.
In Rhineland-Palatinate, by contrast, the Christian Democrats have enjoyed a polling lead on the governing Social Democrats (SPD) for the last two years and throughout the pandemic. But latest surveys show the conservatives shedding support in the former stomping grounds of late chancellor Helmut Kohl, with centre-left state premier Malu Dreyer now favourite to hold on to her post.
The outcome in both states could be a so-called “traffic light coalition” between the Green party, the SPD and the pro-business Free Democratic party: a power-sharing solution the Christian Democrats would prefer not to receive too much attention ahead of the national vote.
Demoralising defeats in Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg would also pile pressure on the new CDU party chief, Armin Laschet, who was slow to firefight the mask scandal when telling broadcaster ARD on Monday night he was on a “cleaning up” mission: “I am not in the mood to allow this grand project to be destroyed by a few delegates who have nothing but money their minds.”
Laschet, who has been in his post for just over 40 days, can at least show results: Nikolas Löbel, whose company is said to have earned €250,000 for brokering a deal between a mask supplier and two private companies in Mannheim and Heidelberg, has since handed in his mandate and resigned from the CDU.
CSU delegate Georg Nüsslein, whose company is alleged to have earned a €600,000 commission for facilitating deals between a manufacturer of masks and the federal and Bavarian health ministries, has said he will hold on to his post until the September elections.
Nüsslein denies wrongdoing and his lawyer has said he managed during a difficult period to provide help in procuring high-quality masks at a time of crisis “with the help of longstanding contacts to Chinese providers.”
His party boss, Markus Söder, is believed to harbour ambitions to lead the CDU/CSU bloc into the national poll. A decision on who the conservatives will field as their candidate to succeed Angela Merkel is expected to be made around Easter.
In the meantime, the conservative bloc will hope that a lack of further scandals and an uptick in vaccination rates will improve their standing with the public. A poll published by newspaper Bild on Sunday saw the two allied parties projected to receive 32% of the vote, their lowest result since the start of the pandemic."

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic could endanger progress made on gender equality, as women take on the lion’s share of childcare in lockdown and are more likely to work in at-risk jobs.
“We have to make sure that the pandemic does not lead us to fall back into old gender patterns we thought we had overcome,” Merkel said in a video message ahead of International Women’s Day on Monday.
Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, she said, while being underrepresented in decision-making positions.
“Once again, it’s more often women who have to master the balancing act between homeschooling, childcare and their own jobs,” Merkel said.
Women also outnumber men in care professions at a time when those jobs are particularly challenging, she added.

“More than 75% of those working in the health sector are women, from doctor’s offices and hospitals, to labs and pharmacies,” Merkel said – yet women account for barely 30% of management positions in those areas.
“It cannot be that women are to a large extent carrying our society, yet at the same time are not equally involved in important political, economic and societal decisions,” she said.
Recent legislation requires listed German companies to include more women on their executive boards. But Merkel said more should be done to support women, including through expanding childcare facilities and equal pay.
“Women must finally earn the same as men,” she said.
Germany has one of the EU’s largest gender pay gaps, with women earning on average 19% less than men in 2019 – partly because many German women work part-time.
The gap narrows to 6% when comparing men and women in the same jobs.
Merkel’s warnings were echoed in the EU’s annual report on gender equality, released earlier this week.
The study found that the pandemic “has exacerbated existing inequalities between women and men in almost all areas of life”.
On top of increased childcare burdens from school and nursery closures, it said women were also more likely to work in low-paid jobs in the service sectors worst affected by the shutdowns, leaving them at higher risk of unemployment.
It could “take years, or even decades” to overcome the gender setbacks caused by the pandemic, the report said."

Ursula von der Leyen has reassured EU leaders she will ban coronavirus vaccines from leaving the EU if suppliers such as AstraZeneca fail to deliver again, as she faced questions over her handling of shortages.
The European commission president’s pledge at a virtual summit came as leaders issued a statement promising to “accelerate the provision of vaccines”, with just 8% of the population having received a jab compared with 27% in the UK.
“If companies don’t fulfil their contractual obligations, yet do export, the commission may decide to make a move under the export regime,” Von der Leyen told the heads of state and government during the private meeting, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Last month the commission rushed through an emergency authorisation scheme to allow the EU member states to block exports.
Speaking at the post-summit press conference, Von der Leyen said: “We want to see who is exporting where and I was very clear from the very start that is not directed against any kind of country but is focused on the question: does the company that is exporting a vaccine produced in Europe honour the contract in the European Union?
“If we look at the pattern the vast majority of exports is done by BioNTech/Pfizer of 95% approximately. The rest by Moderna. Both of them are honouring their contract so that is fine with us. We are in discussions with AstraZeneca where there is room for improvement where fulfilment of the contract is concerned, so here we have a very close eye on what is going on.”
The comments on Thursday evening followed a defence by AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, of his company’s record to a joint committee of the European parliament where he was grilled over a heavy shortfall in the 120m expected deliveries this quarter.
He told MEPs, who had accused him of failing the EU while delivering to Britain, that the UK government had heavily funded the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, for which the government had a 100m order.
Soriot said the “overwhelming” majority of doses made in its Belgian and Netherlands production facilities “remained in the EU” despite the suspicion within the commission that doses made for member states had leaked over to the UK.
“I am disappointed that lower than expected output in our dedicated European supply chain has affected our ability to deliver, but I want to reassure that we are ramping up production and doing everything we can to deliver 40m doses in the first quarter of 2021 enabling vaccination of 10% of the EU population,” Soriot said.
“The supply chain serving the UK is geared to supply 65 million people who live in the UK. The European community has 450 million people I believe. Even if we took the entire supply of the UK it would not make a huge difference to the European community.”
Speaking to the same parliamentary committee, Franz-Werner Haas, the chief executive of the German pharmaceutical company CureVac, with whom the commission has a contract for 225m doses of its as yet unapproved vaccine, highlighted the unintended consequences of the commission’s policy that forces companies to seek authorisation for vaccine exports.
“This has been hitting us somehow because we couldn’t get clinical trial material to Latin America,” Haas told MEPs. “We did then get immediate support from the commission as well as the German authorities. [But] for rather a small company, 600 people, certainly this adds an extra layer … We lost a week to ship the material which was necessary and is necessary to run the clinical trial.”
Following the leaders’ summit, a statement was issued emphasising the determination to speed up the roll out of vaccines amid the heavy criticism. “We need to urgently accelerate the authorisation, production and distribution of vaccines, as well as vaccination,” they said.
In a reference to the row with AstraZeneca, whose deliveries have been smaller than expected due to production problems, they added that “companies must ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines”.
Von der Leyen was also put under pressure from southern European countries and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, to speed up work on a common vaccination certificate that might in time be used as a “passport” to facilitate travel.
This week the Guardian reported that “technical talks” had begun between officials in the UK and Greece over the potential format of such a document.
In a sign of some nervousness on the issue in France and Germany, among others, where there are concerns that such a scheme will institutionalise discrimination, the leaders committed only “for work to continue on a common approach to vaccination certificates”, adding that they “will come back to this issue”.

“First it must actually be clearly resolved that vaccinated people are no longer infectious,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had said in a newspaper interview before the summit. “As long as the number of those who have been vaccinated is still so much smaller than the number who are waiting for vaccination, the state should not treat the two groups differently.”
Von der Leyen said in the press conference that member states would be able to choose how to use vaccine certificates once a common model was organised.
Merkel had also used her media interview to give her full backing to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, following evidence that people were rejecting it in light of a slew of bad publicity, including Emmanuel Macron’s unsubstantiated claim that it was “quasi-ineffective” in over-65s.
Asked whether she would take the vaccine, Merkel responded that at the age of 66 she was not in the recommended group. The German authorities have initially suggested it only be used in younger groups given a lack of data on efficacy among the over-65s.
Rasmus Bech Hansen, the chief executive of the data analytics company Airfinity, said supply remained the major issue for the EU, with a lack of readiness to then distribute the stocks exacerbating differences between the member states.
According to the latest Airfinity analysis, Malta can expect to reach herd immunity by fully vaccinating 75% of its adult population by 8 August, but the current trajectory for Bulgaria and Latvia is for a similar level of protection to be secured in late October.
France, where Macron has come under criticism for his government’s faltering vaccination efforts, may have to wait until 26 September to achieve herd immunity, although an acceleration of the programme could result in this date being brought forward.
This article was amended on 1 March 2021. The figures relating to people in the EU and UK having received a jab are percentages of the entire population, rather than of the adult population as an earlier version said."

Four out of five of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine doses delivered to EU countries are yet to be used, a Guardian investigation has found, as Angela Merkel admitted to an “acceptance problem” among Europeans being offered the jab.
Using data extracted from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and other official sources, it is estimated that 4,849,752 of the 6,134,707 doses distributed among the 27 member states have not yet been administered.
The decision by authorities in France, Germany, Poland and Italy to recommend use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine only for people under 65 is likely to be a significant factor in its slow administration, with authorities failing to redirect jabs to younger people.
But in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Merkel conceded that the vaccine was also being rejected by people concerned over its efficacy and safety after a slew of bad publicity.
“There is … currently an acceptance problem with the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Merkel said. “AstraZeneca is a reliable vaccine, effective and safe, approved by the European Medicines Agency and recommended in Germany up to the age of 65 years. All the authorities tell us that this vaccine can be trusted. As long as vaccines are as scarce as they are now, you cannot choose what to vaccinate with.”
Asked whether she would volunteer to be administered with the vaccine, Merkel said: “I am 66 years old and I do not belong to the recommended group for AstraZeneca.”
Later on Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would gladly accept an AstraZeneca dose if it were offered when his turn for vaccination comes.
“In view of the latest scientific studies, the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been proven,” Macron said. “My turn will come, but I’ve got time. If that’s the vaccine that’s offered to me, I will take it, of course.”
Last month Macron caused some consternation when he suggested without substance that the AstraZeneca vaccine was “quasi-ineffective” in over-65s.
Data analysed by the Guardian, while vulnerable to a short time lag in reporting by member states, highlights some eye-catching discrepancies between the amount of AstraZeneca vaccine available in member states and its administration to the population.
Belgium has received 201,600 AstraZeneca doses and administered just 9,832 (4%), according to the ECDC, an EU agency. Bulgaria received 117,600 doses and administered 2,035 (1.73%), while Germany has received 1,452,000 doses and administered 189,206 (13%).
According to the ECDC, Italy has had 499,200 AstraZeneca doses delivered and its health practitioners have given just 96,621 jabs (19%).
In contrast, four out of five of the Pfizer vaccine doses supplied to Belgium (81%), Italy (80%) and Germany (82%) have been administered, the ECDC data suggests.
France has not submitted data to the ECDC on how many of its 1,137,600 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses it has administered, but figures provided by the vaccine tracker website Covidtracker.fr estimates the figure at just 125,859 (11%).
Prof Alain Fischer, the “Monsieur Vaccin” overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told a press conference in Paris on Thursday that the AstraZeneca vaccine had received an “unjustifiably bad press”. The latest data showed it was “at least as effective” as the Pfizer and Moderna jabs and entirely safe, he said, adding: “This is a very good vaccine and should be used by everyone who is offered it, without hesitation.”
The EU’s vaccination rollout has been heavily criticised owing to a lack of supply in recent months, with reported shortfalls in production by AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer.
However, the data suggests pejorative comments about AstraZeneca, along with the decision by some regulatory authorities to recommend use for only the younger age groups until more data is available, has also had a significant impact.
The European Medicines Agency approved the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in all age groups, but some national bodies have advised against use in the older age ranges given the lack of data available on efficacy at the time.
Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, defended its decision to approve for all ages at the time, noting that “current evidence does not suggest any lack of protection against Covid-19 in people aged 65”, and adding that it produced “a strong immune response in the over-65s”.
The vaccine is in widespread use in the UK along with that produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, with preliminary data showing high levels of efficacy among older people.
Prof Thomas Mertens, who chairs Germany’s standing commission on vaccination, which advised Merkel’s government in January on not using AstraZeneca in the older age groups, told BBC Radio 4’s Today problem that lack of uptake in his country was “a problem no doubt at the moment”.
He said: “It is true, unfortunately. We are working quite hard on this point to try and convince people to accept the vaccine and to build up again the trust in the vaccine in the population. But as you know this is some kind of psychological problem too and it will unfortunately take some time to reach this goal.”
Asked whether his committee’s advice was to blame, he told the BBC: “It may be part of the problem although we always stated it had nothing to do with the safety of the vaccine; we never criticised the vaccine for being unsafe.
“We stated that the amount of data for this group of elderly people was not really great, it was quite small at the time, when we had to give the recommendation. But I don’t think that was the major problem. The major problem was the news spread about the efficacy of the vaccine being much lower than the mRNA vaccines [for example Pfizer’s] that started earlier.”"

The German government is coming under increasing pressure to offer the nation a roadmap out of the coronavirus crisis amid growing frustration over sluggish vaccination and testing programmes.
The health minister, Jens Spahn, told the Bundestag on Wednesday that the first effects of the vaccine rollout were “already being felt” in the 80s age group, which has received the majority of almost 5.4m vaccinations to have been administered.
But there is growing disgruntlement that Germany remains far behind countries such as Britain, Israel and the US.
The influential Bild Zeitung tabloid asked in its Wednesday edition why Germany was so much slower than Britain. “Dear Britons, We envy you!” its headline read, saying that Boris Johnson’s promise to “return Britain to normality” was “thanks to Britain’s successful vaccine campaign”. The paper went on to ask: “When will we be as far as the British are?”
About 27% of Britons have received a jab, compared with just over 6% of Germans, which also reflects where other EU countries are. Britain has vaccinated about three times as many people as Germany. However, Germany’s incidence rate over a seven-day period is about 60 infections per 100,000 people, compared with the UK’s 116.
Almost 69,000 people have died as a result of Covid-19 in Germany.
Like much of the EU, Germany began vaccinating on 27 December after the European Medicines Agency approved the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine about a month after it was given emergency approval in the UK. But the rollout has been slow and beset by problems, including lack of supply, and latterly, a reluctance amongst Germans to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, after German authorities declared it had not been tested rigorously enough to allow its use on the over-65s. That decision triggered suspicions that it was not safe. Reports of lingering side effects have not helped.
Many Germans have been willing to support the EU’s argument that supplies were short because it had acted out of a sense of solidarity and had sought to provide for all its members equally, regardless of their economic strength, leaving Germany with less vaccine doses than it needed. But increasing suspicions over EU incompetence, officials’ lack of urgency, bureaucratic sluggishness or a possible lack of willingness to pay enough for the vaccines have taken hold in the national debate.
The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has admitted that the EU initially ordered too few vaccine doses. In an interview with the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung published on Wednesday, she said that stock supplies would improve and the EU was “catching up” with the UK.
There has been growing concern over the reluctance amongst the under-65s due to be vaccinated, including hospital staff and care home workers, to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine amid fears that it is not safe, which the government’s health experts insist is not true.
Thousands of people due to be given the vaccine have failed to show up for appointments across the country, triggering angry responses from politicians, including Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, who said those who didn’t want the vaccine had “missed their chance”, and Bavaria’s leader, Markus Söder, who said: “It’s absurd that we have vaccine doses which nobody wants.”
Partly as a result of the amount of unused Oxford/AstraZeneca supplies, the health ministry has altered its priority lists of who should be vaccinated so that teachers and carers from schools and kindergartens are eligible to receive one from Wednesday. Homeless people are also expected to be moved up the priority list.
Spahn was forced to answer questions in the Bundestag on Wednesday over the latest setback after after admitting that his promise to introduce free DIY rapid antigen tests for anyone who wanted one from 1 March was not yet deliverable.
He told MPs that intensive testing would offer a way for the country to find a balance, protecting life, freedom and hospitals, particularly following the partial opening of schools and kindergartens this week and the planned opening of hairdressers on Monday.
The spread of more virulent mutations of the virus, particularly the variant believed to have originated in Kent, has meant Germany is likely at the start of a third wave of the virus, experts have said. Spahn told parliament: “We had the feeling we were on our way out, but due to the mutations that is not the case.”
Two weeks ago the variant from the UK made up about 6% of all new registered infections, but that has since risen to about a third. It is said to be the reason why Germany’s infection rate is rising despite current lockdown measures, which have been in place since November, including the closure of all nonessential shops and sport facilities.
People are obliged to wear medical masks in public places, including in supermarkets and on public transport, and encouraged to wear them elsewhere.
The chancellor, Angela Merkel, is resisting calls for a further relaxation of lockdown rules, calling instead for a reduction of the incidence rate to under 35 per 100,000, which is unlikely to be achieved before Easter, in five weeks’ time.
She was widely reported as having told a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the Christian Democrats on Tuesday evening, whilst recognising “the valid desire for an opening up”, that she favoured “four stages of opening, without a yo-yo effect”."

The G7 club of rich countries pledged nearly $7bn (£5bn) in extra funding on Friday to speed the distribution of Covid vaccines to the world’s poor, but the UN secretary general said the current effort to distribute doses equitably was chaotic and that a global emergency plan to fight the virus was needed.
The two-hour virtual G7 summit hosted by Boris Johnson led campaigners to demand more detail of the timing and substance of pledges. The G7 countries are thought to have bought about 1.5bn vaccines more than their populations will need, but any estimate is subject to many variables.
Johnson said before the summit that the UK would give the majority of its surplus to the UN-led Covax system for distributing vaccines to the world’s poorest countries.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had told the G7 that the west should target 6.5 million health workers in Africa requiring 13m doses. Those doses amounted to 3.4% of the supply available in Europe and should be sent immediately,” he said.
If the west did not act quickly, African countries would feel forced to turn to Russia, China and the pharmaceutical companies, he added.
The Biden administration pledged a conditional $4bn to Covax, and the EU doubled its contribution to $1.6bn. The EU also promised $140m in “in-kind” help to Africa for the vaccination process. Germany separately provided a further $1.8bn, increasing an earlier contribution of $800m. Britain has already contributed $766m to Covax.
The G7 said in a joint communique that they had collectively provided $7.5bn to the scheme.
The UN secretary general, however, told the Munich Security Conference that 75% of vaccines had been monopolised by 10 countries, while more than 100 countries had not received a single dose.
António Guterres suggested that the wider G20 group of countries should set up an emergency team that could create a global vaccination plan. It should bring together countries, companies, international organisations and financial institutions with the “necessary power, scientific expertise and production and financing capacity”, he said, adding that he could mobilise the entire UN systemfor the task.
Bill Gates said the world’s poorest countries were at least six months behind the vaccine progress of the wealthy.
The World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for manufacturers to release more details of their vaccines to the WHO earlier. He said equity was not only the just thing to do but the smart thing to do, and that the world could end up back at square one if the virus was given too much time to mutate.
The very occurrence of a trouble-free G7 with a clear communique on issues such as zero carbon emissions and cooperation with the WHO marked a relative triumph for diplomacy.
By contrast Donald Trump refused to sign a joint statement after a tense G7 meeting in Canada in 2018, a short statement was issued in France in 2019 and an in-person gathering in 2020 was cancelled because of the pandemic. In a sign of their desire to work together, Japan claimed the leaders all pledged to work with it to stage the summer Olympics.
The only glitch came when Johnson had to ask the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to put herself on mute.
Aid agencies said the G7’s Covid proposals were too modest.
“Making huge parts of Africa and Asia wait for unwanted, leftover vaccines from rich countries’ stocks is not just immoral, it is irresponsible,” Oxfam said. “And the lack of coordinated action from the G7 is inexcusable. The longer huge swathes of the world’s population are denied protection, the greater the threat that virus mutations will threaten us all.”
Merkel told reporters after the summit: “We also have an obligation towards our own citizens … There has to be a balance.” She vowed that “not a single German vaccination appointment” would be affected by efforts to improve the global drive."

Pre-pandemic, Europe’s green parties were on a roll. In France last summer, supporters hailed a “green wave” after regional polls handed the Europe Ecology party control of showcase cities such as Lyon, Strasbourg and Bordeaux. Austria’s Greens are the surprise junior partners in a conservative-led coalition government, delivering pioneering measures to curtail short-haul air travel. In the 27 EU member states, five governments now have Green members sitting at the cabinet table.
If ambitious net zero targets are to amount to more than earnest virtue signalling, this infiltration of the political mainstream is both overdue and necessary. And now comes the biggest test – and the greatest opportunity – of all. Consistently running a comfortable second in the polls to Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, and already governing in coalition in 11 states, Germany’s Greens are well-placed to form part of the country’s first “black-green” coalition after September’s federal elections. The CDU’s recent endorsement of the centrist Armin Laschet as its new leader suggests it sees such an alliance as a likely route to staying in power, as Ms Merkel steps down after 16 years in office. The Greens will decide this spring which of its two co-leaders should be its candidate for the top job: the media-savvy and charismatic Annalena Baerbock, or the equally ambitious moderniser Robert Habeck, talked up in some quarters as Germany’s Emmanuel Macron.
It is unlikely that either will end up succeeding Ms Merkel. Bolstered by the chancellor’s generally sure-footed handling of the pandemic, the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have a stable and significant lead in the polls. But a sizeable ministerial presence for the Greens in Berlin would send a powerful signal throughout Europe, as vital decisions are taken about post-pandemic investment. Ms Baerbock and Mr Habeck want to introduce a carbon tax, phase out coal production in Germany far faster, invest more in green technologies, quintuple the use of wind energy and discontinue the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
In a 2016 book entitled Who Dares, Begins, Mr Habeck argues that a modernised green politics can seize the initiative in a political landscape that no longer conforms to a conventional left-right model. Both he and Ms Baerbock have been working overtime to distance the party from past associations with pacifism, and a sometimes censorious approach that earned it the nickname of Verbotspartei (prohibition party). An overtly capitalist, pro-Nato stance will not be to the taste of some of its hardcore supporters, but with poll ratings stable at around 20%, the realo (pragmatic) wing of the party is in charge.
Given the electoral stagnation of the once-formidable Social Democrats, if they continue to play their cards skilfully, die Grünen have a good chance of becoming the number one progressive party in Germany. A note of caution should be sounded, however, as the party attempts, in the words of Mr Habeck, to “become the new playmakers” in Europe’s most powerful country. Green supporters in Germany remain largely middle class, city-based and youthful – much the same demographic that voted for the Europe Ecology party in French cities last year. If voters outside the prosperous cities continue to worry about the impact of a green transformation on their living standards and jobs, the journey to net zero will be both slower and painfully divisive. Addressing that mistrust, particularly in the east, will be a priority for the next German government, whatever its colour."

Germany, Poland and Sweden have each expelled a Russian diplomat in a coordinated act of retaliation over the expulsion of three EU officials by Moscow while the bloc’s foreign policy chief was visiting last week.
The tit-for-tat expulsions on Monday underscored the volatility in east-west relations and an erosion of trust among former cold war foes, as the west accuses Moscow of trying to destabilise it and the Kremlin rejects what it sees as foreign interference.
The EU executive defended Josep Borrell over his trip to Russia where he said he had learned of the initial expulsions via social media while speaking with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday the removal of diplomats from Germany, Poland and Sweden, who were accused by Moscow of taking part in protests last month against the imprisonment of the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, took place a day before Borrell’s trip.
Germany’s foreign office, in a statement regarding its ejection of a Russian diplomat, said the German official booted out by Moscow was only “carrying out his task of reporting on developments on the spot in a legal fashion”.
Poland’s foreign ministry said it ordered a member of Russia’s consulate in the city of Poznan to leave “in accordance with the principle of reciprocity and in coordination with Germany and Sweden”.
The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Stockholm’s action was a “clear response to the unacceptable decision to expel a Swedish diplomat who was only performing his duties”.
Russia’s foreign ministry said the EU countries’ action against its diplomats was “unjustified and unfriendly”, the Interfax news agency reported.
In a blog released late on Sunday, Borrell said his pleas to Russia to halt the expulsions were ignored. The former Estonian defence chief Riho Terras, now an EU lawmaker, has started a campaign calling for the high representative’s resignation.
But the executive of European commission said it had no regrets over Borrell making his first trip to Moscow as the coordinator of EU foreign policy because Russia was set on a course towards confrontation.
“The trip was necessary. One doesn’t give up on a trip because it looks difficult,” the commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said in Brussels. “A trip is not a success or a failure on the basis of what happens during a particular moment.”
Peskov told reporters Russian officials “were not the initiators of the collapse in relations”.
On Tuesday Borrell will address the European parliament, which has called for sanctions to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline between Russia and Germany. Some EU states were intensifying a push for new western sanctions against Moscow, two diplomats said.
Poland convened a two-hour video call with EU states on Monday that was joined by envoys from Britain, the US, Canada and Ukraine, as well as two allies of Navalny, Vladimir Ashurkov and Leonid Volkov, to discuss policy on Russia, including potential sanctions.
Navalny was jailed on 2 February after a Russian court ruled he had violated the terms of a suspended sentence in an embezzlement case that he says was trumped up.
During the official visit, Borrell and Lavrov gave a news conference at which the Russian minister described the EU as “an unreliable partner” and the Spaniard praised Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine.
Borrell had gone to Moscow to seek Navalny’s release and to try to relaunch EU-Russia relations, but in the blogpost he said Friday’s news conference had been “aggressively staged” and the trip had been “very complicated”.
“Russia is progressively disconnecting itself from Europe and looking at democratic values as an existential threat,” wrote Borrell. “It will be for member states to decide the next steps, and yes, these could include sanctions.”"

Angela Merkel has condemned as “unjustified” Russia’s expulsion of European diplomats for participating in unauthorised demonstrations in support of the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
“We consider these expulsions to be unjustified. We believe it is yet another aspect that can be observed right now of Russia being quite far from the rule of law,” the German chancellor said on Friday at an online press conference with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.
Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said earlier that the decision by Moscow to declare the diplomats from Poland, Germany and Sweden personae non gratae would “not go unanswered”. Maas said the German diplomat concerned had been “solely fulfilling his duty … of informing himself about developments on the ground by lawful means”.
The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described the expulsion as a “crude attempt” to distract from Russia’s targeting of opposition leaders, saying it was further evidence of Moscow “turning its back on international law”.
Meanwhile, Navalny appeared in a Moscow court for the second time this week, this time on a charge of defaming a second world war veteran. The Russian opposition leader, who earlier this week was ordered to serve two years and eight months in prison, criticised the latest hearing as a “disgusting PR trial” intended by the Kremlin to disparage him.
Last June Russia’s investigative committee launched an investigation into Navalny on charges of defamation, after the politician called people featured in a video promoting constitutional changes that allowed for an extension to Vladimir Putin’s rule “corrupt stooges”, “people without conscience” and “traitors”.
The authorities maintained that Navalny’s comments “denigrate [the] honour and dignity” of a war veteran featured in the video. If convicted, Navalny faces a fine or community service.
Born in 1976 just outside Moscow, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer-turned-campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation investigates the wealth of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.
He started out as a Russian nationalist, but emerged as the main leader of Russia's democratic opposition during the wave of protests that led up to the 2012 presidential election, and has since been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side.
Navalny is barred from appearing on state television, but has used social media to his advantage. A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months.
He has been repeatedly arrested and jailed. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014. Election officials barred him from running for president in 2018 due to an embezzlement conviction that he claims was politically motivated. Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote 'not against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me; against 200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me'.
There has also been a physical price to pay. In April 2017, he was attacked with green dye that nearly blinded him in one eye, and in July 2019 he was taken from jail to hospital with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate poisoning. In 2020, he was again hospitalised after a suspected poisoning, and taken to Germany for treatment. The German government later said toxicology results showed Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent.
Navalny was sent to prison again in February 2021, sentenced to two years and eight months, in a move that triggered marches in Moscow and the arrest of more than 1,000 protesters. By April he was described as being ""seriously ill"" in prison.
“This trial was conceived as some kind of PR trial, because the Kremlin needs headlines, ‘Navalny slandered a veteran’,” the politician said in court on Friday.
Last month Navalny – an anti-corruption investigator and Putin’s most prominent critic – was arrested upon returning from Germany where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities reject the accusations.
On Tuesday a Moscow court found Navalny had violated the probation terms of his suspended sentence from a 2014 money-laundering conviction, and ordered him to serve two years and eight months in prison.
The politician’s arrest and jailing triggered massive protests across Russia, as tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demand his release. Many protesters also chanted slogans against Putin, in the largest show of discontent in years. Thousands of protesters have been detained.
The EU’s top diplomat said on Friday that the bloc’s ties with Russia had reached a new low after the jailing of Navalny, but still raised hopes of cooperation. In Moscow for talks with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, repeated European calls for Navalny’s release and an investigation into his poisoning.
“Our relationship is indeed in a difficult moment,” Borrell told Lavrov, adding that EU-Russia ties were “under severe strain and the Navalny case is a low point”.
The west has fiercely condemned the decision to jail the 44-year-old, as well as the crackdown on pro-Navalny protesters. Borrell, however, said there were no immediate plans for new European sanctions, and he and Lavrov stressed that the two sides would continue to work together on issues including the coronavirus pandemic.
Borrell’s visit was the first to Russia by a senior EU envoy since 2017, following years of deteriorating relations prompted by Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Germany’s finance minister has attacked the European commission’s Covid vaccine strategy as “really shit”, Bild has reported, as Angela Merkel’s centre-left coalition partners seek to exploit anger over the issue before federal elections.
Olaf Scholz, who is also the vice-chancellor, reportedly criticised the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, by name during a cabinet meeting on Monday, saying Berlin could not “let this shit repeat itself” and that the vaccine debacle was “a disgrace”.
Scholz is the most senior cabinet member from Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior partners in Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-led “grand coalition” for 12 of the past 16 years.
The SPD fiercely opposed the appointment of Von der Leyen, a former defence minister and longtime Merkel ally, as commission chief in 2019, describing her as an “inadequate and inappropriate candidate”.
With federal elections due in September, Merkel and her CDU health minister, Jens Spahn, are coming under increasingly heavy fire over the pace of the vaccine deployment in Germany, where just 3.2% of the population have so far received at least one dose.
By contrast, the UK has administered at least one dose to 15.7% of its residents, while several EU members including Denmark (5%), Ireland (4%), Spain (3.8%) and Italy (3.7%) are also outperforming Germany. The EU average is 3.16%.
This week Merkel defended the EU process, conceding that it “rankled” that others were vaccinating faster but insisting the bloc’s slower collective strategy was the right one. “A virus that affects us all cannot be defeated by one country alone,” she said.
The SPD, trailing in the polls on about 15% to the CDU’s 35%, is gambling on attacking its coalition partner by seeking to capitalise on popular frustration over the vaccination programme. Last month Scholz sent Spahn a four-page list of questions on the vaccine strategy.
Merkel and Spahn have been criticised for allowing the commission to take control of vaccine procurement, a move backed by the EU27 to avoid a repeat of the splits in the first wave of the pandemic when several member states blocked exports of protective equipment.
It was feared a similar approach to vaccines would have led to wealthy countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands scooping up the lion’s share of doses while smaller ones such as Croatia and Slovakia inevitably lost out in a failure of EU solidarity.
The commission eventually ordered 2.3bn doses from six manufacturers, but with no experience of such a vast public procurement exercise it is seen as having handled negotiations more like trade talks, focusing on price and liability rather than investing in securing a maximum of shots as fast as possible.
That led to the EU’s orders being placed several months later than London’s and Washington’s, and in turn to supply shortfalls that have forced many EU members including Germany to temporarily halt their inoculation programmes.
Problems have been compounded by the European drug regulator’s longer approval process, production issues and delays in Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca shipments, and some states being ill-prepared for the doses that have arrived."

National leaders are starting to feel the heat over the EU’s struggling Covid vaccine rollout, which is increasingly being seen as overcautious, marred by mistakes and miscalculations, and achingly slow to progress.
Shaken by the weekend’s high-profile blunder in Brussels, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron felt the need to explicitly defend the bloc’s approach this week, as vaccination numbers continue to lag behind those of countries such as Israel, the UK and US.
The German chancellor conceded on Tuesday night that it “rankled” that others were vaccinating faster, but said the EU’s slower but collective strategy had been the right one. “All in all, I don’t think anything has gone wrong,” Merkel said.
France’s president also said, in an unexpected TV appearance on Tuesday, that progress “may seem slow” compared with countries that had “made other bets”. But he added: “I defend the strategy we have adopted with Germany, with the EU.”
Both reiterated their pledge that a jab would be offered to all adults who wanted it by the end of the summer. EU member states have so far collectively administered at least one dose to just 3% of the population, against 59% in Israel, 15% in the UK and 10% in the US.
EU countries are at different stages in their struggle with the virus, with some, such as Italy and Poland, lifting lockdown restrictions and others, such as Germany and the Netherlands, retaining them, mainly over concerns about new variants.
France, meanwhile, hopes to avoid a third national lockdown as case numbers remain stable but comparatively high, while Portugal has been hit by a devastating surge and on Wednesday accepted doctors, nurses, ventilators and hospital beds from Germany.
Nonetheless, criticism of the EU’s slow vaccine rollout has been building, not least in Germany where media and politicians jostling in the run-up to September elections have taken aim at Merkel and her ally the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.
The EU’s decision to collectively purchase and distribute vaccines enjoyed broad support in principle, mainly because of the bloc’s experience in the first wave of the virus when several member states blocked exports of protective equipment.
A similar approach to vaccines would have led to wealthy countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands doing well, while the likes of Croatia and Slovakia would have lost out, the former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb stressed this week.
“Small EU states would have had virtually no negotiating power,” Stubb tweeted. “Big states would have swept the doses.” Playing a national card when “the virus does not respect borders” would necessarily be, he said, “a race to the bottom … The key is to coordinate.”
But the commission, which had no experience of a public procurement exercise on this scale, handled negotiations with manufacturers more like the trade talks with which it is more familiar, focusing on price and questions of liability rather than securing a maximum of doses fast.
That led to late orders and, subsequently, supply shortfalls. Delays have also been compounded by the European drug regulator’s longer approval process, and by several states seemingly being ill-prepared for the doses that have arrived.
The EU’s top performers include Denmark, Ireland, Spain and Italy, all of which have delivered at least one dose to more than 3.5% of their populations. Underperformers include the Netherlands, Austria and France, on less than 2.5%.
Many EU countries, however, are focusing on delivering two doses within the interval recommended by vaccine manufacturers and the World Health Organization. By that measure, both Germany and Italy are outperforming the UK.
Merkel, Macron and Von der Leyen have all stressed the importance of public trust in the vaccination process, highlighting among reasons for the EU’s slow progress its decision not to follow Britain in seeking emergency approval for Covid shots.
Germany, France, Poland, Italy and Sweden have all announced they will avoid giving the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to over-65s, citing a lack of data on its efficacy among that age group. Belgium has set the threshold at 55.
Emmanuel Rivière, the director of international polling at Kantar, said many Europeans were “torn between a desire to be vaccinated and a need to be convinced it’s safe”. He cited a survey for the commission showing that while a majority of those polled in the 27 member states said they wanted a jab, only 23% wanted it immediately, with 29% preferring “sometime in 2021” and 18% later still.
Although the EU’s drug regulator had yet to approve a single vaccine at the time of the poll in late December, 62% – including majorities in 19 countries – felt Covid vaccines were “being developed, tested and authorised too quickly” to be safe.
“There is a feeling that if this doesn’t happen too fast, it’s not too big a problem,” Rivière said. “People want to see how it goes. It’s ‘hurry up – but slowly’.”
There is anger, too, at big pharma, widely seen as having played games.
Fabian Zuleeg, of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre thinktank, said he thought there was “perhaps a slightly different take on the continent, a feeling that speed is not all, that even if you vaccinate very quickly, that does not necessarily resolve everything”.

Zuleeg said he “understood the focus on vaccination numbers”, but would like to see a “broader discussion of their role amid other measures in the overall purpose, which is reducing excess deaths and preventing health systems being overwhelmed”.
Some European analysts point out that developed countries such as Australia, Japan and South Korea have not yet begun vaccinating at all – and some hope the EU’s approach will end up paying off.
“Acting together was the right choice for the EU, although avoidable mistakes were made,” said Stefan Lehne, of the Carnegie Europe thinktank. “Rather than engaging in a blame game, the EU, member states and pharmaceutical companies now need to work together to ramp up production as rapidly as possible.”"

The German government is expected to announce tighter border controls after warnings from leading virologists that the move is vital to control the spread in the country of more contagious variants of Covid-19.
Angela Merkel, the chancellor, is widely reported to have told a meeting of her CDU party colleagues that air travel in particular needed to be restricted “to the extent that you simply can’t get anywhere any more”.
The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said in an interview with the tabloid Bild that the danger posed by the recent Covid mutations, particularly B117 which was first detected in the UK, “required dramatic measures”.
He said: “The threat posed by coronavirus mutations demands from us that we also examine the more drastic measures and discuss them, including much more thorough border controls, particularly in those areas bordering high-risk zones, as well as the reduction of air travel to Germany to more or less zero, just like Israel is doing right now, in order to prevent the introduction of the virus mutations.”
The German government is coming under increasing pressure to act, from the virologists and epidemiologists advising them, with Belgium being looked to as an outrider after it closed its borders to all but essential traffic on Wednesday. The Belgian ban will be in place initially until 1 March, and puts an end to all holiday and leisure travel. Law enforcement agencies are to carry out rigorous checks on roads, at airports, ports and railways. Excluded from the ban are goods transports, visits to marital partners or cohabitants, travel for reasons of work or study as well as to attend funerals of close relatives.
Norway, not an EU member, announced on Wednesday it would will close its borders to all but essential visitors.
Sandra Ciesek, professor of virology at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, has led the call for a Europe-wide ruling on borders: “We must try to delay the spread of the variants in Germany. That can only function if it’s Europe-wide, because we are not living isolated on an island,” she said in a weekly podcast on the radio station NDR.
Being at the heart of Europe, surrounded by nine countries, Germany is particularly vulnerable to the cross-border spread of the virus. But politically and morally, closing the borders has been seen as off the table by decision-makers throughout much of the crisis, a stance that has its roots in Germany’s longstanding commitment to an open Europe. The current debate has echoes of the 2015 refugee crisis, when Merkel said it was a moral necessity to keep the borders open to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who came to Germany.
The 506 mile (815 km) Czech border is seen as a particular weak point in Germany’s attempts to control the virus. The Czech Republic’s deaths from coronavirus are now among the highest in the world and almost a tenth of the population is known to have been infected. The B117 variant is known to be spreading across the country. Since Monday, the 35,000 Czechs who commute to Germany for work on a regular basis, from medical staff to cleaners, will have to present a new negative test every 48 hours before they are allowed to enter Germany. Industry bosses have complained the rule amounts to a border closure. Long queues have reportedly formed at the border of those waiting to be tested, leading to anger and frustration.
Christian Drosten, head of virology at the Charité teaching hospital in Berlin, said plans for tighter travel restrictions “make sense from a scientific perspective”. He added: “The more vigorously the brakes are put on the spread of the coronavirus in the country, the more important it is to look at what is being introduced from outside,” he told the broadcaster ARD.
But the pro-business liberal FDP has led the calls for a rethink, saying instead of introducing travel restrictions, the national effort should be focused on vaccinating as many Germans as possible. By Tuesday lunchtime just over 1.672 million Germans had received a jab, compared with about 7 million people in the UK.
“Flight and travel bans don’t help at a time like this … rather much faster vaccination,” said Wolfgang Kubicki, deputy leader of the FDP, in an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe. “Vaccines are the most reliable and only way out of this pandemic,” he said, accusing the government of “replacing real solutions with tokenism”."

Tragically, that's a relative success story;"There have been blunders, and vaccine rollout has been slow, but most Germans seem happy with Angela Merkel’s response
Germany, it seems, barely noticed when it hit 50,000 deaths from Covid-19. To be fair, there has been a lot of news lately – had we arrived at this grim milestone earlier, when it didn’t have to compete with Donald Trump’s ignominious exit from the White House, the beginning of Joe Biden’s presidency, and the election of Armin Laschet to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union, there surely would have been an avalanche of opinion pieces and memorials.
Instead, it was buried. And while leaders in the UK have been scrambling and bickering, lest Britain become “a failed state”, as Gordon Brown has warned, German politicians seem more tired than anything else. The election of Laschet seems to indicate that the CDU leadership intends to try to carry Merkel’s legacy – and, with a 72% approval rating for the chancellor, the relative competence with which Germany has handled the pandemic seems to be recognised by the public.
In the spring, Germany seemed to have all the answers. Its test-and-trace regime was the envy of Europe. It had more hospital beds and more ventilators than anywhere else in the continent. Its Kurzarbeit (“short work”) scheme and generous social welfare programmes seemed to ensure that economic fallout from the lockdown would be kept to a minimum. The recipe, at the time, seemed simple. Avoid austerity, and run screaming away from rightwing populism. Accept that people need both to stay at home and have food to eat, and adjust social support programmes accordingly. Make policy decisions based on science, and communicate them clearly to a population whose intelligence you do not underestimate.
There have, in the meantime, been some blunders on the part of Merkel’s government. The most serious among them was certainly the “lockdown light” which began in November and was intended to clear the way for a safe festive season. It’s impossible to know, of course, what the situation might be like now, had the government not taken those measures. But it’s also clear that the pandemic worsened substantially despite these directives to minimise social contact, and the government-mandated closure of bars, restaurants, night clubs, gyms, pools and museums, while leaving shops, schools and daycare open.
But even as they failed to contain the virus, these measures induced a certain pandemic weariness that spread to even the most avid supporters of the lockdown regulations. Plus, when it became clear that the “lockdown light” wasn’t going to succeed in reducing numbers enough for Germans to celebrate a normal Christmas, Merkel’s government introduced stricter regulations shortly before the holidays. Though, almost as if to make things more confusing, the “hard lockdown” included a number of exceptions designed to allow families to spend the Christmas holidays together.
The fact that confusion and frustration followed can hardly be surprising. To make matters worse, Germans continue to wait for a vaccination programme to begin in earnest – health minister Jens Spahn’s failure to secure enough doses of the vaccine counts as another major error in the governing coalition’s management of the crisis. In general, though, it isn’t at all clear what Germans think Merkel should have done instead. On the one hand, an initiative popular among parts of the left has argued for a “zero Covid” campaign, in which the economy and social life would be stopped nearly entirely in the hopes of reducing the number of new cases to nothing. The proposal is based on an article first published in the Lancet in which a number of leading epidemiologists, including Christian Drosten, the tsar of Germany’s coronavirus response, proposed a radical lockdown in hopes of reducing the number of new cases to 10 per million inhabitants per day.
But zero Covid has been met with strong criticism from nearly every side of the political spectrum – as well as from some public health experts. The economic effects would be catastrophic; the measures could be enacted only with “half-totalitarian” policies; the cost for children, for women, and for the arts would be enormous. On the other side of the debate, given the high economic, social and psychological costs of lockdown measures, an increasing number of commentators are beginning to claim that we must “learn to live” with the pandemic. “Returning to normal,” wrote Jakob Augstein, publisher of the left-leaning weekly Der Freitag last week, “means returning to the virus.”
But both of these calls for radically different approaches to the pandemic feel half-hearted. We’ve all seen the problems that come with a harder lockdown by now, while the example of Sweden has shown that relying on voluntary measures alone will likely lead to an alarming increase in the mortality rate. With the most recent reports showing a slight but steady improvement in the infection rate, discussions about loosening Germany’s hard lockdown are certain to intensify – as is exhaustion with the continued efforts to slow the spread of the disease.
All in all, however, most Germans seem to feel that Merkel’s government has responded to the pandemic passably well. Distressingly enough, it turns out that 50,000 Covid dead might indeed be the picture of a successful response to the pandemic in a major European country.

Angela Merkel has warned of the danger of a third wave from the new variants of coronavirus, as EU leaders drew up a blueprint that could lead to a ban on travellers from the UK and restrictions on movement across the bloc’s internal borders.
The German chancellor said member states needed to act in unison to avoid border closures even within the bloc, given the dangers presented by the highly contagious mutations of the virus. On Thursday night, Portugal suspended flights to and from the UK to contain the new variant that emerged in Britain.
Earlier leaders examined options available to them at a videoconference summit chaired by the European council president, Charles Michel, and firm decisions on border restrictions are expected to be made in the coming days.
There was agreement that the risks of highly contagious variants of coronavirus identified in Britain, South Africa and Brazil demanded common action. “Extensive border controls would be a last resort for us too and … we will do a lot to try to prevent that,” Merkel said. “But they also can’t be ruled out completely if someone has completely different ideas.”
Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, told the 26 other leaders that he believed non-essential travel between member states should be banned during the school break in February.
“It is important to be clear that this does not mean that we close the borders,” De Croo said before the meeting. “Non-essential travel, which we can do without now, such as tourism, clearly we can no longer take that risk.”
A large number of leaders said non-essential travel should be prohibited more generally, even if borders remained open. It was also agreed that a common vaccination certificate would be drawn up but would not be used as a travel document “at this stage”.
The European commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU executive would share a formal proposal on Monday on how the bloc might keep the borders open. She said that targeted measures would be required, including a new “mapping” of Europe to locate where the new variants are prevalent.
One proposal from the German government is that identification of a large number of cases of the new variants, whether the country is in the EU or outside the bloc, should be sufficient to ban travel from a particular area.
The prevalence of virus variants in parts of the EU would be added to the criteria for restricting freedom of movement within the bloc, with an option available to prohibit movement out of an area “in line with national law, for example to a 15km radius”.
For those outside the EU, such as the UK, the prohibition on movement could be countrywide, according to the plan, which will continue to be debated.
“Where member states consider this necessary to protect public health, they are free to impose further-reaching temporary bans on entry and on transporting passengers entering from third countries with virus variant areas,” German officials wrote in a paper circulated to the EU capitals before the discussions on Thursday evening.
But in the short-term, Von der Leyen said those coming into the EU for essential reasons should be tested before travelling.
Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told ARD television that the EU’s internal borders would also need to be closed if the new, more transmissible, variants could not be brought under control.
“The danger is that when the infections in a country go up, this mutation becomes a quasi-majority variant and then the infection can no longer be controlled,” he said. “And therefore even stricter entry rules at our internal borders are unavoidable, and since everyone does not want that, it is important that we act together now.”
Officials in Berlin wrote in their paper: “Protecting the health of EU citizens while ensuring freedom of movement within the EU and travel without border checks within the Schengen area make it necessary for member states to take coordinated action to contain the spread of new variants of concern of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
“The variants known so far are B117 (the British mutation) and 501V2 (the South African mutation); there is the fear that further mutations will emerge. Only if member states take joint and coordinated action can the virus be contained effectively. For this reason, we see an urgent need to act in order to prevent, or at least slow down, the spread of worrying virus variants to and within the EU+ area (EU member states plus Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland).”
The German government said the priority was to maintain essential supply chains while clamping down on further infection.
Berlin proposed test centres at internal EU borders as one tool, with mandatory quarantine for those coming from areas with high prevalence of the new variants.
There would only be exceptions for transit, and people working in the passenger and goods transport sector, and health workers.
Diplomatic sources said there was a determination to avoid the scenes in March and April last year when countries acted unilaterally to close their borders to fellow EU citizens.
Leaders also discussed concerns over shortages of vaccine in parts of the bloc. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer cut in half the volume of Covid-19 vaccines it will deliver to some EU countries this week, government officials said on Thursday.
Romania received only 50% of its planned volume for this week, with the other half set to be allocated gradually by the end of March, with deliveries returning to normal starting next week, the country’s deputy health minister, Andrei Baciu, said on Thursday.
In Poland, 176,000 doses were received on Monday, a fall of about 50% from what had been expected. The Czech government said it also expected to have to slow down its vaccination programmes.
“We have to expect that there will be a reduction in the number of open vaccination appointments in the following three weeks,” said the Czech health minister, Jan Blatny.
Pfizer deliveries were said to have fallen by 15% this week and there may be a 30% cut in doses over the following two weeks. Pfizer has declined to comment on the changes to distribution.
A European commission spokesperson said they believed that the fall in dose numbers would be resolved swiftly. “As from next week, we go again to 100% in doses,” the spokesperson said."

Alexei Navalny’s decision to return to Russia from Berlin, having survived a suspected assassination attempt by state security agents, was an act of extraordinary bravery. On arrival at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday night, the Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner told reporters that he fully expected to be allowed to go home. But given what happened in the summer, he will have known that there was every risk that this would not happen.
In a hastily convened court hearing, held in a police station, a judge ruled on Monday that Mr Navalny would be kept in custody for 30 days. He is being held for allegedly breaching the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence, following a fraud conviction. The European court of human rights ruled that conviction to be politically motivated. It seems likely that the three-and-a-half-year sentence handed down may now be carried out.
Rather than choose the safer option of exile in Germany, Mr Navalny elected to continue the fight for democratic reform on Russian soil. At various points over the last decade or so, he has been badly beaten up while campaigning, nearly blinded in one eye following a chemical attack and regularly imprisoned. Still he came back from Berlin. In placing his arch-critic under lock and key, Vladimir Putin has shown boundless contempt for the civil rights of his citizens. Mr Navalny has shown himself willing to sacrifice his freedom for the cause he represents.
Worldwide condemnation of the Kremlin has been predictably swift. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described Mr Navalny’s detention as “appalling”. Joe Biden’s incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, called for the perpetrators of the assassination attempt to be brought to justice. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, warned Moscow about its international obligations to the rule of law and the protection of civil rights. The question is what comes next.
Confronted yet again with Mr Putin’s brutal determination to silence legitimate opposition, the west faces another bout of soul-searching. The Kremlin takes no notice whatsoever of moral lectures from foreign capitals, while targeted sanctions, such as those imposed in the wake of the Skripal affair, have had limited effect.
The timing, two days before the presidential inauguration in Washington, constitutes an early test for Mr Biden. In the autumn, as Donald Trump resisted bipartisan calls to impose sanctions following Mr Navalny’s poisoning, the president-elect pledged to work with allies to hold the Kremlin accountable for its actions. But those allies are themselves somewhat divided over how best to deal with Mr Putin.
In the wake of the suspected FSB poisoning of Mr Navalny, which is denied by the Kremlin, European Union sanctions were imposed on six senior Russian officials it believed to be associated with the plot. Despite calls for wider-ranging action, there was little appetite to go further. In Germany, Angela Merkel is likely to face renewed questions over a much-criticised $11bn gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, which is nearing completion. The German chancellor has argued that tougher economic isolation of Mr Putin’s Russia would be counterproductive. Her approach is shared by the newly elected leader of the CDU, Armin Laschet. But the impunity with which Mr Putin continues to flout international norms makes this policy of constructive engagement an increasingly hard sell.
For its part, Britain has been talking a good foreign policy game post-Brexit. Some MPs will on Tuesday vote to block a potential post-Brexit trade deal with China over human rights concerns. But there has been a reluctance to use powers such as those afforded by the Magnitsky Act to make life truly uncomfortable for Russian interests, or to clamp down on money laundering in London. Mr Navalny has put his life on the line in the battle for Russian democracy. His predicament deserves a more vigorous response than the one that followed his near-death experience in the summer."

The election of Armin Laschet as the new leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union has been welcomed by those hoping for a smooth transition after the imminent departure of Angela Merkel from political leadership. But his detractors have warned he faces an uphill challenge to unite not just his party but also the country in the event that he becomes chancellor, at a time of national crisis and division.
Laschet, who is now in line to succeed Merkel as chancellor after the parliamentary elections in September, secured victory at the weekend despite the odds having been on Friedrich Merz, a prominent conservative and investment banker. Norbert Röttgen, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, dropped out after the first round, prompting many of his supporters to back Laschet. The digital vote must still be confirmed by a postal ballot.
Even as Merkel bows out of politics at the next election – having stepped down as party leader in 2018 – her influence on the weekend’s leadership contest, held online for the first time in German history, became clear when she gave Laschet her tacit backing, urging continuity for her centrist course. The big question now is whether the party can stand on its own feet without her and retain those who supported the party because of her. Laschet pointed out that many people had voted for the party over the past 15 years mainly due to their support of Merkel.
Commentators on Sunday welcomed the centrist Laschet’s emphasis on social cohesion and reconciliation, saying he had frequently been told that the secret to political success was the art of polarisation. “No, you don’t need to polarise,” he told the conference. “Polarisation is easy, the poison that is quick to grasp.” In contrast, the CDU he said, “has to speak clearly, but not to polarise”.
He recalled the recent chaotic scenes at the Capitol in Washington DC as a reminder of where divisive leadership could lead. Political figures in Germany had been quick to connect the Washington riots with German anti coronavirus-lockdown protesters’ attempts last year to unlawfully enter the Reichstag building in Berlin and by extension with the arson attack on the Reichstag in 1933 that was central in the establishment of Nazi Germany.
But German commentators were almost unanimous in their assessment of the weighty challenge Laschet now faces. “Armin Laschet campaigned as a big reconciler,” said news magazine the Spiegel. “But the CDU leader must now do justice to the demand for this in the party.” This would also include the need to integrate the disappointed supporters of the rightwing Friedrich Merz, the magazine said.
Just hours after his defeat, Merz, who had been campaigning for the leadership role for a year, requested the post of economics minister. A spokesman for Merkel said that there were no plans to reshuffle the cabinet or replace the current economics minister, Peter Altmaier, a Merkel ally. Laschet also said a cabinet switch was “not on the agenda”. However, he may yet be forced to include Merz in a new lineup to keep him close to hand and appease his large band of supporters within the party.
The conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Laschet had been “the safe choice” for Germany’s largest party. It said Laschet had won support due to his proven experience in government as leader of the most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where he has held together a broad coalition since winning power there from the Social Democrats in 2017.
It pointed out that Merkel’s successor as CDU leader in 2018, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who announced her resignation last year, had also stood on a ticket of continuity and keeping the grand coalition with the Social Democrats intact, but that that had also been her undoing. Kramp-Karrenbauer was not mentioned in Merkel’s short speech to the party conference, her last as chancellor.
It remained to be seen, the paper said, whether Laschet could now deliver “the fresh air and clear-cut lines” that many in the party craved.
The co-leaders of the Green party, which is currently performing strongly and has the potential to enter government in September in a power-sharing deal with the CDU, welcomed the clarity of Laschet’s election. “He must now newly define the CDU after the era of Angela Merkel and clarify what the party actually stands for,” Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck said in a statement.
Olaf Scholz, chancellor candidate for the Social Democrats, wished Laschet luck and said: “This year … will be a challenge for us all.” Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland, the main opposition party in the Bundestag, said Laschet’s election amounted to “political lockdown” for the CDU.
Laschet will face his first big tests at two regional elections in March, in the states of Rheinland-Pfalz and Baden-Württemberg. His chance of becoming the party’s chancellor candidate in this autumn’s election will depend on how the CDU performs in those polls.
Markus Söder, the popular state leader of Bavaria and head of the Christian Social Union, the CDU’s sister party, is his direct contender and may yet force him to stand aside. Jens Spahn, the health minister, long tipped as a candidate, has won praise for his management of the coronavirus crisis. He was elected as Laschet’s deputy leader but performed much worse than expected after appearing not to respect the voting process by holding a campaign speech for Laschet."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/16/germany-cdu-vote-successor-to-angela-merkel;2021-01-16;Germany: Merkel's party chooses Armin Laschet as leader;"New leader of centre-right CDU will run for chancellor in September, or have a big say in who does
Angela Merkel’s continuity candidate, the centrist conservative Armin Laschet, has beaten one of her longest-standing rivals in the contest to lead Germany’s Christian Democratic Union.
In a digitally-held party congress, Laschet beat the conservative hardliner Friedrich Merz by 521 to 466 votes in a run-off vote, following a strong speech that emphasised social cohesion and held up recent scenes from Washington DC as a warning example of divisive leadership.
The third candidate on the ballot, the foreign policy specialist Norbert Röttgen, was eliminated in the first round of voting.
Once the digital vote has been confirmed by a postal ballot, Laschet will formally replace Merkel’s previously designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who announced her resignation as CDU chair in February 2020 after an unsuccessful period in the spotlight. Merkel stepped down as party chair in December 2018.
In times of geopolitical unrest and pandemic uncertainty, Laschet’s promise to follow Merkel’s consensual course may also earn him the opportunity to lead the Christian Democrats into German elections on 26 September as his party’s official candidate for chancellor.
In theory, the party could nominate another politician to run for the chancellorship: potential candidates would be Markus Söder, the popular leader of CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, or the health minister, Jens Spahn, who ran as the number two in Laschet’s campaign.
If Laschet were to be anointed as the CDU’s chancellor candidate in the coming weeks, he would find himself up against campaigning against the colourless but competent Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, currently Germany’s finance minister, and either Annalena Baerbock or Robert Habeck representing the Greens, currently second in the polls.
As a former member of the “pizza connection” – a loose network of young conservative and Green delegates who scoped out political similarities over dinner in the mid-90s – Laschet would seem a natural fit to lead the CDU into its first ever coalition with the ecological party.
Under current projections, a CDU-Green coalition would be the only power-sharing deal to guarantee an absolute majority at federal elections. Laschet, and his two rival contenders, had already ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, currently polling at around 8%.
The only one of the three candidates to currently hold a governing post, the Roman Catholic from Aachen has governed Germany’s most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia since 2017 in a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats. Previously an MEP and a minister for integration in his home state, he was a vocal ally of Merkel’s open-borders policy during the 2015 refugee crisis.
Laschet was initially seen as the clear favourite to win the race for the German centre-right’s leadership, but his nationwide approval ratings plummeted during the pandemic.
An early advocate of relaxing Germany’s first lockdown in the spring, he drew criticism over lackadaisical leadership. Most recently, there were charges of nepotism over PPE procured from a fashion company that also employs his son to model its clothes on his Instagram channel.
According to a recent poll by broadcaster ZDF, only 28% of Germans surveyed thought he had the calibre to become chancellor, compared with ratings of 54% for Söder and 45% for Scholz.
Questions remain over his foreign policy views, which have yet to be fully probed. “The Germany that I envision is a European Germany”, Laschet said in his speech on Saturday.
But his past complaints about “anti-Putin populism” and sympathetic comments about Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, have raised eyebrows among colleagues in the broadly trans-Atlanticist CDU.
At Saturday’s digital congress, the three candidates delivered short speeches in an empty congress hall, pitching their qualities to the 1,001 delegates watching on their home computers.
Laschet made the best of the unusual circumstances with a speech that would not have been out of place at the rival Social Democrats’ congress, woven around a personal story about his miner father’s solidarity with his fellow workers.
Pointing to the recent scenes of mob violence in Washington DC, Laschet cautioned against inviting similar levels of division in German political debate and came close to likening his rival Merz to the US president: “Some people say you have to polarise opinion. I say no, you don’t have to. Anyone can polarise opinion.”
Merz’s and Röttgen’s speeches, by contrast, were lighter on storytelling and heavier on buzzwords, with both candidates seemingly trying to brush off some of the views they have been typecast for.
An impressive orator in more confrontational settings, Merz’s speech in particular lacked focus. His boast that “my wife wouldn’t have married me” if his views on women were really as outdated as his critics had painted them is unlikely to have swayed any female delegates.
Laschet reminded delegates in his speech that over the last 15 years many people will have voted for the CDU because they were fans of Angela Merkel, not because they admired her party. State elections in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on 14 March will serve as a first indicator whether the Laschet-led CDU can replicate that success."
