Scholz, of the center-left Social Democrats, said the new government would not seek “the lowest common denominator, but the politics of big impacts.”
He stressed the importance of a sovereign Europe, friendship with France and partnership with the United States as key cornerstones of the government’s foreign policy — continuing a long post-war tradition.
Scholz said he expects that members of the parties will give their blessing to the deal in the next 10 days.
The Social Democrats have been negotiating with the environmentalist Green party and the pro-business Free Democrats since narrowly winning a national election Sept. 26.

Angela Merkel, a once-obscure scientist who claimed the global spotlight, leaves a mixed legacy as her 16-year tenure as Germany’s chancellor ends.


If party members sign off on it, the three-way alliance — which has never yet been tried in a national government — will replace the current “grand coalition” of the country’s traditional big parties. The Social Democrats have served as the junior partner to Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats.
Merkel, who didn’t run for a fifth term, is expected to be succeeded by Scholz, 63, who has been her finance minister and vice chancellor since 2018.
The three would-be governing parties have said they hope parliament will elect Scholz as chancellor in the week beginning Dec. 6. Before that can happen, the deal requires approval from a ballot of the Greens’ roughly 125,000-strong membership and from conventions of the other two parties.

News of the deal came as Merkel led what was likely to be her last Cabinet meeting. Scholz presented the 67-year-old, who has led Germany since 2005, with a bouquet of flowers.
The negotiations over the alliance were relatively harmonious and speedy compared with previous coalition talks. But the political transition, with Merkel as a lame-duck caretaker, has hampered Germany’s response to the latest rise in coronavirus cases.

Forming a new German government after the Social Democrats’ election win over departing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right bloc could take months.


Few details have emerged from the closed-doors talks, including how the parties will divide up the ministerial portfolios. The alliance is a potentially uneasy mixture because it brings together two traditionally left-leaning parties with one, the Free Democrats, that has tended to ally with the center-right.
A preliminary agreement last month indicated that Germany would bring forward its deadline for ending the use of coal-fueled power from 2038 to 2030, while expanding the rollout of renewable energy generation.
World & Nation
Election officials said early Monday that a count of all 299 constituencies showed the Social Democrats won 25.9% of the vote, ahead of 24.1% for the Union bloc.


At the Free Democrats’ insistence, the prospective partners said they won’t raise taxes or loosen curbs on running up debt, making financing a central issue.
Merkel’s Christian Democrats are currently preoccupied with a leadership contest over who will become their next leader and revive the party’s fortunes after it suffered its worst-ever election result."

Scholz’s government takes office with high hopes of modernizing Germany and combating climate change but faces the immediate challenge of handling the country’s toughest phase yet of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lawmakers in the Bundestag voted 395-303 to elect Scholz, with six abstentions — a comfortable majority, though short of the 416 seats his three-party coalition holds in the 736-seat lower house of Parliament. That’s not unusual when chancellors are elected, and some lawmakers were out sick.
Scholz was formally appointed by Germany’s president, then returned to Parliament to be sworn in. The new chancellor, who has no religious affiliation, omitted the optional phrase “so help me God” from his oath of office — as did Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder.
Merkel, who is no longer a member of Parliament, looked on from the spectators’ gallery during the vote. Lawmakers gave her a standing ovation as the session started.
Scholz, 63, Germany’s vice chancellor and finance minister since 2018, brings a wealth of experience and discipline to an untried coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats. The three parties are portraying the combination of former rivals as a progressive alliance that will bring new energy to the country after Merkel’s near-record time in office.

Angela Merkel, a once-obscure scientist who claimed the global spotlight, leaves a mixed legacy as her 16-year tenure as Germany’s chancellor ends.



“We are venturing a new departure, one that takes up the major challenges of this decade and well beyond that,” Scholz said Tuesday. If the parties succeed, he added, “that is a mandate to be reelected together at the next election.”
Scholz, an unflappable and self-confident figure who in the past has displayed an ability to put aside setbacks quickly, cracked a smile as he was elected and as he was formally appointed by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Merkel has said she won’t seek another political role. The 67-year-old hasn’t disclosed any future plans but said earlier this year that she will take time to read and sleep, “and then let’s see where I show up.”
World & Nation
Germany’s health minister calls on the unvaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots, saying that more than 1% of the population has the coronavirus.

Scholz’s style has often been likened to Merkel’s, although they are from different parties. Like the former chancellor, Scholz isn’t given to public displays of emotion or rousing speeches. He has portrayed himself in recent months both as her natural successor and an agent of change, and styles himself as a strong leader.
The new government aims to step up efforts against climate change by expanding the use of renewable energy and bringing Germany’s exit from coal-fired power forward from 2038 to 2030. It also wants to do more to modernize the country, including improving its notoriously poor cellphone and internet networks.
It plans more liberal social policies, including legalizing the sale of cannabis for recreational purposes and easing the path to German citizenship while pledging greater efforts to deport immigrants who don’t win asylum. The coalition partners want to lower the voting age in national elections from 18 to 16.
The government also plans to increase Germany’s minimum wage to 12 euros ($13.50) per hour, which Scholz has said would means “a wage increase for 10 million.” And the coalition pledged to get 400,000 new apartments built per year in an effort to curb rising rental prices.

U.S. secretary of State announces an initiative with Germany to confront Holocaust denial and educate about the ‘descent into darkness’ of Nazism.


Scholz has signaled continuity in foreign policy, saying the government would stand up for a strong European Union and nurture the transatlantic alliance. The new government said he would make his first trip abroad with a visit to Paris on Friday — maintaining a tradition for German chancellors — and then travel to Brussels the same day to meet EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders.
The three-party alliance brings both opportunities and risks for all the participants, perhaps most of all the Greens. After 16 years in opposition, they will have to prove that they can achieve their overarching aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions while working with partners who may have other priorities.
Greens co-leader Robert Habeck will be Scholz’s vice chancellor, heading a revamped economy and climate ministry. The government’s No. 3 official will be Christian Lindner, the finance minister and leader of the Free Democrats, who insisted that the coalition reject tax hikes and looser curbs on running up debt.
“It won’t be easy to keep three different parties together,” Schroeder, who led Germany from 1998 to 2005 as the country’s last center-left chancellor, told Phoenix television. “But I think Olaf Scholz has the patience, but also the determination, to manage it.”
The incoming government is portraying itself as a departure in both style and substance from the “grand coalitions” of Germany’s traditional big parties that Merkel led for all but four years of her tenure, with the Social Democrats as junior partners.
In those tense alliances, the partners sometimes seemed preoccupied mostly with blocking each other’s plans. Merkel’s final term saw frequent infighting, some of it within her own center-right Union bloc, until the pandemic hit. She departs with a legacy defined largely by her acclaimed handling of a series of crises rather than any grand visions for Germany.
The agreement to form a coalition government between three parties that had significant differences before the election was reached relatively quickly and in unexpected harmony. That will now be tested by the reality of governing; Scholz has acknowledged that dealing with the pandemic “will demand all our strength and energy.”
German federal and state leaders last week announced tough new restrictions that largely target unvaccinated people. In a longer-term move, Parliament will consider a general vaccine mandate. Germany has seen daily coronavirus infections rise to record levels this fall, though they may now be stabilizing, and hospitals are feeling the strain. The country has suffered more than 104,000 COVID-19 deaths so far.
“People are hoping that you ... will show leadership and take the right measures,” Steinmeier, Germany’s ceremonial president, told the newly appointed Cabinet. “What matters is not listening to the loudest, but ensuring that the pandemic doesn’t keep us firmly in its grip for another year and that public life can once again become a matter of course.”"
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-07/germany-angela-merkel-last-day-chancellor;2021-12-07;German Chancellor Angela Merkel bows out after 16 years - Los Angeles Times;"Angela Merkel was assured of a place in the history books as soon as she became Germany’s first female chancellor Nov. 22, 2005.
Over the next 16 years, she was credited with raising Germany’s profile and influence, working to hold a fractious European Union together, managing a string of crises and being a role model for women.
Now that near-record tenure is ending with her leaving office at age 67 to praise from abroad and enduring popularity at home. Her designated successor, Olaf Scholz, is expected to take office Wednesday.
Merkel, a former scientist who grew up in Communist East Germany, is bowing out about a week short of the record for longevity held by her onetime mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who reunited Germany during his 1982-1998 tenure.
While Merkel perhaps lacks a spectacular signature achievement, the center-right Christian Democrat came to be viewed as an indispensable crisis manager and defender of Western values in turbulent times.
She served alongside four U.S. presidents, four French presidents, five British prime ministers and eight Italian premiers. Her chancellorship was marked by four major challenges: the global financial crisis, Europe’s debt crisis, the arrival of vast numbers of refugees in Europe in 2015-16 and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Angela Merkel, a once-obscure scientist who claimed the global spotlight, leaves a mixed legacy as her 16-year tenure as Germany’s chancellor ends.

“It’s undeniable that she’s given Germany a lot of soft power,” said Sudha David-Wilp, the deputy director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Undoubtedly, she’s elevated Germany’s image in the world.

“When she first came onto the scene in 2005, a lot of people underestimated her, but she grew in stature along with Germany’s role in the world,” David-Wilp added. Others in Europe and beyond “want more of an active Germany to play a role in the world — that may not have been the case before she was in office, necessarily.”
In a video message at Merkel’s final European Union summit in October, former President Obama thanked her for “taking the high ground for so many years.”
“Thanks to you, the center has held through many storms,” he said.
World & Nation
Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel has made what is likely her final appeal before leaving office for Germans to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Appreciation from her counterparts over the years was genuine, although there was plenty of friction as well. Merkel always sought to keep the EU as tightly knit as possible but strongly defended Germany’s interests, clashing with Greece during the euro debt crisis and disagreeing with Hungary, Poland and others over their refusal — unlike Germany — to host migrants arriving in Europe.
At home, her record is also a mixed bag. She leaves Germany with lower unemployment and healthier finances, but also with well-documented shortcomings in digitization — many health offices resorted to fax machines to transmit data during the pandemic — and what critics say was a lack of investment in infrastructure.
After announcing in 2018 that she wouldn’t seek a fifth term, Merkel failed to secure a smooth transition of power in her own party, the CDU, which slumped to defeat in Germany’s September election.
The incoming governing coalition under Scholz, a Social Democrat, says it wants to see “more progress” for Germany after years of stagnation.
But Germans’ overall verdict on Merkel appears to remain favorable. During the September election campaign, from which she largely was absent, Merkel’s popularity ratings outstripped those of her three would-be successors. Unlike her seven predecessors in postwar Germany, she is leaving office at a time of her choosing.
Merkel’s body language and facial expressions sometimes offered a glimpse of her reactions that went beyond words. She once lamented that she couldn’t put on a poker face: “I’ve given up. I can’t do it.”
She was never the most glamorous of political operators, but that was part of her appeal. Merkel continued to take unglamorous walking holidays, was occasionally seen shopping at the supermarket and lived in the same Berlin apartment as she did before taking the top job.
Named “The World’s Most Powerful Woman” by Forbes magazine for the past 10 years in a row, Merkel steps down with a legacy of breaking through the glass ceiling of male dominance in politics — although she also has faced criticism for not pushing harder for more gender equality.
“Angela Merkel brought class and dignity to a very important position and made very hard decisions ... and did so based upon principle,” former President George W. Bush told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in July. He described her as “a compassionate leader, a woman who was not afraid to lead.”"

Merkel gave what is expected to be her last weekly video message two days after federal and state leaders decided on a series of measures meant to break a wave of coronavirus infections.
The measures include excluding unvaccinated people across the country from nonessential stores, restaurants and sports and cultural venues. In a longer-term move, parliament will consider a general vaccine mandate.
At least 68.9% of Germans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, short of the government’s aim of a minimum 75% vaccination rate. The number of unvaccinated residents has been blamed as a key factor in a surge of new virus cases in recent weeks.
Official figures suggest that the infection rate may now be stabilizing, but at too high a level.

Opinion
Are the conservative Supreme Court justices really as driven by personal belief, not legal grounding, as they seem? The depressing answer is yes.

The national disease control center Saturday reported 64,510 new daily cases and a seven-day infection rate of 442.7 new cases per 100,000 residents. An additional 378 deaths in 24 hours brought Germany’s total in the pandemic to 102,946.
“Every one of them leaves behind families or friends, stunned, speechless and helpless,” Merkel said in her video message. “This is so bitter because it is avoidable. With the effective and safe vaccines, we have the key to this in our hands.”

She renewed a plea to Germans to take the virus seriously, adding that the new Omicron variant “appears to be even more contagious than the previous ones.”
“Get vaccinated, no matter whether it’s a first vaccination or a booster,” Merkel said. “Every vaccination helps.”
Merkel is expected to leave office Wednesday and be replaced by Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democratic Party, who is currently vice chancellor. Scholz said Saturday that his government’s “most important first task” is to “fight the corona pandemic with all the strength that we have.”
“There would be a different situation now if just a few more citizens had also made the decision to get vaccination,” he said at a convention of the Social Democrats. “We must again make a whole new effort, set in motion a whole new campaign” to get more shots in arms, Scholz said.
Senior members of the party denounced a Friday evening protest outside the home of Saxony state’s health minister, Petra Koepping, a Social Democrat. About 30 people gathered with torches and placards outside the home in the eastern town of Grimma.
The demonstrators chanted against coronavirus policies before fleeing in cars when police arrived."

Merkel’s office said the outgoing German leader spoke with Putin by phone and underlined that the exploitation “of migrants against the European Union by the Belarusian regime is inhuman and completely unacceptable.” Merkel “asked the Russian president to exert his influence on the regime in Minsk.”
EU leaders accuse Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of opening up a new migration route on the bloc’s eastern edge to create instability in retaliation for EU sanctions on his authoritarian regime. The EU imposed the sanctions over a brutal crackdown on domestic dissent following Lukashenko’s disputed election to a sixth term in August 2020.
The readout of Merkel and Putin’s call released by the Kremlin said the Russian leader “proposed to establish a discussion of the problems that have arisen in direct contacts of representatives of the EU member states with Minsk.” It also said that Putin and Merkel — who is due to step down as chancellor once a new German governing coalition is formed — “agreed to continue the conversation on the issue.”
Moscow is a close ally of Minsk, and Germany is a favored destination for migrants to the European Union.
Meanwhile, the European Union said for the first time that it was discussing the possibility of funding a wall on the EU’s external borders. The EU’s executive commission has never allowed money to be used to finance walls, fences or barriers but is facing pressure by several member countries to do so now.

People hoping to reach Europe from war-torn lands are finding themselves pawns in an escalating dispute between Belarus and the European Union.

European Council President Charles Michel, who oversees the EU’s political agenda and meetings of European leaders, said during a visit to Warsaw on Wednesday that the commission would discuss the possibility of financing “physical infrastructure at the borders” in coming days.

During a visit aimed at showing support for Poland, Michel said that Poland was facing a “serious crisis” and a “brutal attack” and deserved solidarity from the rest of the 27-nation EU.
The Polish Defense Ministry and local police reported that multiple groups of migrants tried to push into Poland from Belarus late Tuesday and early Wednesday but that all the people who made it across the border were detained. Hundreds of migrants have been camping since Monday on the Belarusian side of the border, near the village of Kuznica.
Poland’s Defense Ministry also accused Belarusian forces of firing shots into the air in a border area where migrants have set up a makeshift camp. The ministry posted a video on Twitter with noises of what sounded like shots.

A court in Belarus sentences two opposition activists to lengthy prison terms, the latest move in the government’s relentless crackdown on dissent.

For months there has been heavy migration by people from the Middle East seeking to enter Poland, Lithuania and, to a lesser degree, Latvia, all of which are on the EU’s eastern border.
Thousands of migrants along the Belarus-Poland border, including families with children, have been tugged back and forth in a forested area of swamps and bogs. Already eight deaths have been confirmed, with the situation growing more perilous as temperatures drop to below freezing at night.
Poland’s government has faced criticism from the United Nations refugee agency and many Poles for pushing migrants back across the border into the forest. But the government in Warsaw has received support from the U.S. and from European leaders as large numbers of migrants have used wire cutters and what appeared to be tree trunks or poles to try to force their way into Polish territory.
Belarus’ State Border Guard Committee said in a post on the Telegram messaging app Wednesday that four men of Kurdish descent in the makeshift migrant camp at the border were injured. The committee accused Polish security forces of inflicting the injuries.
“According to the refugees, they were detained on the territory of Poland, where they tried to ask for protection and refugee status. Judging by the numerous injuries ... the Polish security forces mistreated the men and forcibly pushed them out through a barbed fence on the border with Belarus,” said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of bloodied individuals.
It is impossible to independently verify the information. Independent journalists face limits on reporting in Belarus, while a state of emergency in Poland also prevents journalists from entering a zone along the border.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who met with Michel on Wednesday, has described the current situation as the first time in 30 years that “the integrity of our borders is being tested.” Poland threw off Soviet rule three decades ago.
Morawiecki also suggested Tuesday that Russia was behind the migration pressure from Belarus. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the suggestion.

Belarus’ president defends his diversion of a flight carrying a dissident activist who was later arrested, a move that has sparked outrage.

“We consider statements by the Polish prime minister that Russia is responsible for this situation absolutely irresponsible and unacceptable,” Peskov said.
In one of the cases of attempted forced entry, a group of migrants with tools and equipment breached a razor wire fence late Tuesday near the village of Bialowieza in northeast Poland, according to a local border guard. All were detained and returned to the border with Belarus.
Humanitarian workers and local volunteers in the area have been helping migrants who make it across the border, offering them food, water and clothing.
Polish police stopped a group of activists who were on their way to the border Tuesday night as they approached the Kuznica border crossing, German news agency DPA reported.
The activists had planned to pick up migrants in Poland and help them reach Germany. However, the German Interior Ministry warned that “unauthorized transport and possible unauthorized entry” could have criminal consequences, DPA reported."

What does she leave behind? - Los Angeles Times;"Angela Merkel, that most pragmatic of world leaders, is perhaps the last person one would associate with things mystical.
But the German chancellor, now in the waning days of a titanic 16 years in power, veered away from her trademark empiricism two years ago when she spoke to an American graduating class.
“’In all beginnings dwells a magic force,’” Merkel told a Harvard commencement, quoting the German-Swiss writer Hermann Hesse.
Merkel’s own beginnings were so unassuming that they lend almost fairy-tale overtones to her rise: an obscure scientist who emerged from behind the fallen Berlin Wall to become not just Germany’s first female chancellor, but also one of the world’s most famous women, and Europe’s most powerful leader.
Many now worry what lies ahead without the leader often seen as the glue holding the European Union together. “The European project has always had its fault lines, but they have rarely caused earthquakes,” Ana Palacio, a former foreign minister of Spain, wrote last month on the global affairs website Project Syndicate, musing about potential ruptures within the bloc over defense, economy and foreign policy.
In a post-Merkel era, she wrote, “is the EU in for a tremor — or worse?”
For younger Germans, Merkel has been the only head of government in memory. That simple fact — a confident woman comfortable at the heart of power — will probably prove a lasting legacy.
“My daughters have only known one leader, and it’s been a woman,” said Julius van de Laar, a political consultant in Berlin. “That in itself is substantial.”
Her matter-of-fact mien, unfussy personal style and calmly rational discourse sometimes lent themselves to satire, but Merkel in many ways embodied the self-image Germans aspired to: unadorned, smart, purposeful.
“I’ve got some of the same characteristics as camels have,” she once said, lightly mocking her own somewhat plodding political persona. “I’ve got quite a lot of capacity in my reserve tanks, but there always comes a point when I need to fill them up again.”
Merkel’s landmark tenure saw her hailed for a time as the chief custodian of the liberal Western democratic order — leader of the free world, some went so far as to say — especially after Donald Trump captured the Oval Office. At the head of Europe’s most powerful economy, her leadership was crucial in guiding the continent through the 2008 financial crash and an unprecedented crush of migration in 2015.
But she leaves a distinctly mixed legacy at home, critics say, including a checkered environmental record, an over-reliance on China as a trade partner and a failure to implement badly needed economic and technological reforms.
At 67, Merkel is the first postwar German leader to voluntarily step aside, rather than being voted out of office like her eight male predecessors. But the immense popularity she long enjoyed may not save her center-right party from stinging defeat in Sunday’s election.
Many observers attribute both the successes for which she is lionized, as well as the lapses for which she has been vilified, to a combination of her temperament and a political climate shaped by Germany’s dark 20th century history.
“Germans appreciate her humility and lack of vanity,” said Joern Leonhard, a German author and professor of history at the University of Freiburg. “They like the way she dealt with so many crises over the years, and her incremental way of approaching problems.”
When Merkel became chancellor, sexism was commonplace and constant. In her early days in politics, Merkel was slightingly referred to as “das Madchen""— the girl — or sometimes “Kohl’s girl,” after her then-mentor, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with whom she eventually broke. The nickname “Mutti” — Mommy — was first bestowed in derision by political rivals, though it was one she later came to tacitly accept, especially when invoked by grateful refugees.
Throughout Merkel’s tenure, imperturbability was a signature trait, and it served her well in face-to-face encounters with self-styled alpha-male leaders such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin and President Trump. An iconic photo of her at a Group of 7 summit in Canada in 2018 captured her leaning forward intently, appearing to admonish a seated, truculent-looking Trump, chin jutting and arms folded across his chest.
Trump’s election victory may have prolonged Merkel’s time in office. Germany has no term limits, and political lore has it that then-President Obama, on a visit to Berlin weeks after the 2016 vote, persuaded a reluctant Merkel to run for one more term.
During Trump’s tumultuous tenure, she “continued to stand up for Western ideals,” said Stefan Kornelius, a biographer of the chancellor and senior editor at the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
“She kept alive the idea that democracies are still alive,” he said.
Raised in East Germany, the Lutheran pastor’s daughter with a doctorate in quantum chemistry entered politics at the relatively advanced age of 35, shortly after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. Merkel’s scientific training was credited with helping the country navigate a fearsome once-in-a-century public health emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic.
And a moral compass that tilted toward compassion led her to welcome more than a million mainly Syrian refugees in 2015, accompanied by the brisk admonition that “we’ll manage,” though the migrant wave helped galvanize Germany’s far right. She adroitly managed other crises, including the 2010 near-meltdown of the Eurozone economy that threatened the global financial system, though her insistence on severe austerity measures in Greece prompted some to call her coldhearted.
Over the years, her stolid, reassuring qualities proved a balm to a country still haunted by the horrors of the Holocaust, postwar repression in East Germany under communist rule, and reunification more than three decades ago that carried overtones of both liberation and lasting trauma for “Ossies” — East Germans — like her.
Merkel was a master of the German style of “leading from behind” on a continent still wary of strongman-style political figures even more than six decades after the end of World War II. Seen as the quintessential “safe pair of hands,” she often summed up her no-drama political style with a favorite maxim.
“There’s no point banging your head into a wall,” she was fond of saying, “because the wall will always win.”
Never one for public displays of temper, the chancellor in 16 years fired only one of her 55 rotating Cabinet ministers, for insubordination. Longtime Merkel watchers describe a political acumen that helps her instantly read a room and size up an audience.
“Germans don’t like loudmouths; they like those who can lead quietly and from behind,” said Van de Laar. “Merkel has been an incredibly savvy leader in her party who has read shifts in public sentiment exceptionally well.”
Still, critics point to missteps and blind spots: failing to rein in undemocratic practices in EU member states such as Hungary and Poland, progressive rhetoric on climate change that was not always matched by decisive action, an at-times excessively accommodating stance toward China, colored by economic dependence.
Merkel’s tenure overlapped with a disquieting consolidation of far-right forces in German politics, with the hard-line nationalist-populist Alternative for Germany for the first time gaining a foothold in Parliament, in 2017. Questions also persist about Germany’s role in the Western military mission in Afghanistan, whose final unraveling occurred on her watch, and government blunders that exacerbated deadly flooding in the Rhine region in the summer.
And as elsewhere, the pandemic stubbornly refuses to fully recede.
“She mismanaged her exit,” said Leonhard, the history professor. “My judgment is that she’s leaving about four too years late.”
Days before Sunday’s vote, opinion polls indicated Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union, the country’s dominant postwar party, was trailing the center-left Social Democrats and their likely allies, and could end up out of power.
During her four terms, Merkel pushed her party into the political center by ending military conscription, mothballing nuclear power plants, expanding renewable energy, agreeing to shut down coal-burning power plants over the next 15 years, and introducing extensive new government-funded assistance to families.
Those measures, applauded by progressives, siphoned millions of voters away from rival parties on the left. But it also opened space on the far right for the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which attracted millions of right-wing voters as it morphed into a vociferously anti-immigrant party.
Some political observers describe Merkel as a skilled tactician, but one who has proven less agile in anticipating longer-term policy ramifications.
“She was good at fixing things at critical junctures, but hasn’t developed any strategic vision,” said Leonhard.
He and others said that Merkel leaves office without developing a blueprint for the EU’s future, or for dealings with Russia and China, or for handling the next refugee crisis. She failed to champion much-needed economic reforms, they say, which could eventually dent Germany’s standing as Europe’s financial powerhouse.

The physical demands of Merkel’s long tenure have been increasingly evident in recent years. She is sometimes visibly fatigued, and in 2019 she suffered public episodes of uncontrolled trembling.
“Merkel has been worn out over the last half-year,” said Kornelius, the biographer and editor. “The pandemic has absorbed any energy she had left, while the floods in July only made things worse.”
Even so, he predicted that history would see the departing chancellor in a favorable light.
“For her legacy, the overall picture should be considered,” said Kornelius. “Germany has gone through some really serious crises, and the overall view is that she has done a good job. She’ll be remembered for 16 years of stability and predictability.”

Olaf Scholz, the leader of the center-left Social Democrats, called for Merkel’s center-right Union bloc to go into opposition after it saw its worst-ever result in a national election. But both parties finished with well under 30% of the vote, which appeared to put the keys to power in the hands of two opposition parties — raising questions over the stability of a future government.
Armin Laschet, the Union’s candidate, disputed the idea that the election gave any party a clear mandate, and made clear he still hopes to lead a new government. But he sounded considerably less confident Monday than he did a day earlier, when he said his bloc would do “everything we can” to form one — and some allies hinted at skepticism that that would happen.
Whoever becomes chancellor will lead Germany into a new era. During her 16 years in office, Merkel was seen abroad not just as Germany’s leader but in many ways as all of Europe’s, helping steer the European Union through a series of financial and political crises and ensuring that her country maintained a high profile on the international stage. It remains to be seen whether the next chancellor will match her global standing.
The unclear result, combined with an upcoming French presidential election in April, creates uncertainty — at least for now — in the two economic and political powers at the center of the EU, just as the bloc faces a resurgent Russia and increasing questions about its future from populist leaders in Eastern European countries.
Both Scholz, who is the departing finance minister and vice chancellor, and Laschet, who is governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, staked a claim to leading the new government Sunday night. Scholz, who pulled his party out of a long poll slump, sounded confident Monday.
World & Nation
Angela Merkel, a once-obscure scientist who claimed the global spotlight, leaves a mixed legacy as her 16-year tenure as Germany’s chancellor ends.

But the kingmakers are likely to be two prospective junior partners in any coalition, the environmentalist Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats. The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither has ruled out going the other way.

“Voters have spoken very clearly,” Scholz said Monday. “They strengthened three parties — the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democrats — so this is the visible mandate the citizens of this country have given: These three parties should lead the next government.”
Laschet said his party also wants to lead a coalition with the two smaller parties. The only other option that would command a parliamentary majority is a repeat of the “grand coalition” of the Union and Social Democrats. That is the grouping that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel’s 16 years at the top, though this time it would be under Scholz’s leadership, with Merkel’s bloc as junior partner. That coalition has often been marred by squabbling, and there is little appetite for it.
Scholz and others were keen to dispel concerns that lengthy haggling and a new, multiparty government would mean unstable leadership in Europe’s biggest economy.

About 20 million German voters were expected to turn to their phones or other online devices for app advice on which candidates to pick on Sunday.

“My idea is that we will be very fast in getting a result for this government, and it should be before Christmas if possible,” Scholz told reporters in Berlin. “Germany always has coalition governments, and it was always stable.”
Scholz, an experienced and pragmatic politician whose calm, no-frills style is in some ways reminiscent of Merkel’s, pointed to continuity in foreign policy. He said a priority would be “to form a stronger and more sovereign European Union.”
“But doing so means also to work very hard on the good relationship between ... the European Union and the United States,” he added. “The transatlantic partnership is of [the] essence for us in Germany ... and so you can rely on continuity in this question.”
Scholz was clear that Merkel’s Union bloc should bow out of government. He said the Union “received the message from citizens that they should no longer be in government but go into opposition.”
But Laschet held out the possibility that he might form a coalition despite what he called “painful losses,” for which he said he bears a “personal share” of the blame. Other senior center-right figures were more skeptical.
Markus Soeder, the more popular Union politician whom Laschet beat to run as the bloc’s nominee for chancellor, said a second-place party had “no entitlement” to form a government, “so we can only make an offer.”
The Greens made significant gains in the election to finish third but fell far short of their original aim of taking the chancellery, and the Free Democrats improved slightly on a good result from 2017.
Merkel’s outgoing government will remain in office until a successor is sworn in, a process that can take weeks or months. Merkel announced in 2018 that she wouldn’t seek a fifth term.
World & Nation
During Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis, Germany took in more than 1 million newcomers, sparking a backlash by some. Five years on, tensions have eased.


Amid concern over rising nationalism and populism, other European leaders will be reassured that mainstream parties will form Germany’s next government. Sunday’s election saw weaker results for the far-right Alternative for Germany and, at the opposite end of the spectrum, the Left Party. The strong showing by the Greens could also help ease passage of the EU’s landmark “Fit for 55” climate change package aimed at making the 27-nation bloc carbon-neutral within 30 years.
Final official results gave the Social Democrats 25.7% of the vote and the Union 24.1%. Four years ago, they won 20.5% and 32.9% respectively. The Union — made up of Laschet’s Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister, the Christian Social Union — had never previously polled below 31% in a national parliamentary election.
The Greens took 14.8%, the Free Democrats 11.5% and Alternative for Germany 10.3% — a decline from the 12.6% it took to enter parliament for the first time in 2017. The smallest party in the new parliament is the Left Party, which won just 4.9% of the vote.
The new Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, will have a record 735 lawmakers. The parliament varies in size because of a peculiarity of Germany’s electoral system, which means that it can be considerably bigger than the minimum 598 seats."
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-09-26/germany-election;2021-09-26;Merkel era comes to messy end as Social Democrats squeak to German election win - Los Angeles Times;"Germany’s center-left Social Democrats won the biggest share of the vote in a national election Sunday, narrowly beating outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the long-time leader at the helm of Europe’s biggest economy.
The Social Democrats’ candidate Olaf Scholz, the outgoing vice chancellor and finance minister who pulled his party out of a years-long slump, said the outcome was “a very clear mandate to ensure now that we put together a good, pragmatic government for Germany.”
Despite getting its worst-ever result in a federal contest, the Union bloc said it too would reach out to smaller parties to discuss forming a government, while Merkel stays on in a caretaker role until a successor is sworn in.
Election officials said early Monday that a count of all 299 constituencies showed the Social Democrats received 25.9% of the vote, ahead of 24.1% for the Union bloc. No winning party in a German national election had previously taken less than 31% of the vote.
Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state who outmaneuvered a more popular rival to secure the nomination of Merkel’s Union bloc, had struggled to motivate the party’s base and suffered a series of missteps.

Angela Merkel, a once-obscure scientist who claimed the global spotlight, leaves a mixed legacy as her 16-year tenure as Germany’s chancellor ends.

“Of course, this is a loss of votes that isn’t pretty,” Laschet said of results that looked set to undercut by some measure the Union’s previous worst showing of 31% in 1949. But he added that with Merkel departing after 16 years in power, “no one had an incumbent bonus in this election.”
Laschet told supporters that “we will do everything we can to form a government under the Union’s leadership, because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernizes our country.”
Both Laschet and Scholz will be courting the same two parties: the environmentalist Greens, who were third with 14.8%; and the pro-business Free Democrats, who took 11.5% of the vote.

The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither ruled out going the other way.
The other option was a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition” of the Union and Social Democrats that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel’s 16 years in power, but there was little obvious appetite for that after years of government squabbling.
“Everyone thinks that ... this ‘grand coalition’ isn’t promising for the future, regardless of who is No. 1 and No. 2,” Laschet said. “We need a real new beginning.”

World & Nation
About 20 million German voters were expected to turn to their phones or other online devices for app advice on which candidates to pick on Sunday.

The Free Democrats’ leader, Christian Lindner, appeared keen to govern, suggesting that his party and the Greens should make the first move.
“About 75% of Germans didn’t vote for the next chancellor’s party,” Lindner said in a post-election debate with all parties’ leaders on public broadcaster ZDF. “So it might be advisable ... that the Greens and Free Democrats first speak to each other to structure everything that follows.”
Baerbock insisted that “the climate crisis ... is the leading issue of the next government, and that is for us the basis for any talks ... even if we aren’t totally satisfied with our result.”
While the Greens improved their support from the last election in 2017, they had higher expectations for Sunday’s vote.
The Left Party was projected to win only 4.9% of the vote and risked being kicked out of parliament entirely. The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no one else wants to work with — received 10.3%. This was about 2 percentage points less than in 2017, when it first entered parliament.
Due to Germany’s complicated electoral system, a full breakdown of the result by seats in parliament was still pending.
Merkel, who has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises, won’t be an easy leader to follow. Her successor will have to oversee the country’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.
World & Nation
Some similar underpinnings are seen in far-right violence in Germany and the United States.

Germany’s leading parties have significant differences when it comes to taxation and tackling climate change.
Foreign policy didn’t feature much in the campaign, although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.
Whichever parties form the next German government, the Free Democrats’ Lindner said it was “good news” that it would have a majority with centrist parties.
“All of those in Europe and beyond who were worried about Germany’s stability can now see: Germany will be stable in any case,” he said.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sent early congratulations to Scholz.
“Spain and Germany will continue to work together for a stronger Europe and for a fair and green recovery that leaves no one behind,” he wrote on Twitter.
In two regional elections also held Sunday, the Social Democrats looked set to defend the post of Berlin mayor that they have held for two decades. The party was also on course for a strong win in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania.
For the first time since 1949, the Danish minority party SSW was set to win a seat in parliament, officials said.

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-07-18/merkel-tours-surreal-flood-scene-vows-aid-climate-action;2021-07-18;Europe floods: Merkel tours 'surreal' scene, vows aid - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel surveyed what she called a “surreal, ghostly” scene in a devastated village Sunday, pledging quick financial aid and a redoubled political focus on curbing climate change as the death toll from floods in Western Europe climbed above 180.
Merkel toured Schuld, a village on a tight curve of the Ahr River in western Germany where many buildings were damaged or destroyed by rapidly rising floodwaters Wednesday night.
Although the mayor of Schuld said no one was killed or injured there, many other places weren’t so lucky. The death toll in the Ahrweiler area, where Schuld is, stood at 112. Authorities said people are still missing and they fear the toll may still rise.
In neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany’s most populous, 46 people were killed, including four firefighters. Belgium confirmed 31 deaths.
Merkel said she came away from Schuld, still partly strewn with rubble and mud in bright sunshine, with “a real picture of, I must say, the surreal, ghostly situation.”
“It is shocking — I would almost say that the German language barely has words for the devastation that has been wreaked,” she said at a news conference in a nearby town.
Merkel said authorities will work to “set the world right again in this beautiful region, step by step,” and her Cabinet will approve an immediate and medium-term financial aid program Wednesday.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that more than  $354 million will be needed. And he said officials must set up a longer-term rebuilding program that, from experience with previous flooding, will be in the billions of euros.
“Thankfully, Germany is a country that can manage this financially,” said Merkel, who is stepping down as chancellor following an election in September. “Germany is a strong country and we will stand up to this force of nature in the short term — but also in the medium and long term, through policy that pays more regard to nature and the climate than we did in recent years. That will be necessary too.”

Climate scientists say the link between extreme weather and global warming is unmistakable and the urgency to tackle climate change undeniable.
Scientists can’t yet say for sure whether climate change caused the flooding, but they insist that it certainly exacerbates the extreme weather disasters on display around the world.
“We must get faster in the battle against climate change,” Merkel said, pointing to policies already set in motion by Germany and the European Union to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “And nevertheless, the second lesson is that we must pay great attention to adaptation” to climate change.
Investing in fighting climate change is expensive, she said, but failing to do so is even more costly.
“One flood isn’t the example of climate change, but if we look at the loss events of recent years, decades, then they are simply more frequent than they were previously — so we must make a great effort,” Merkel said.
Although the rain has stopped in the worst-affected areas of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, storms and downpours have persisted elsewhere in Western and Central Europe. There was flooding Saturday night in the German-Czech border area, in Germany’s southeastern corner, and over the border in Austria.
About 130 people were evacuated in Germany’s Berchtesgaden area after the Ache River swelled. At least one person was killed and the rail line to Berchtesgaden was closed.
The Berchtesgaden area also is the home of the sliding track in Koenigssee, the site of major international bobsled, skeleton and luge events for more than 50 years. Large segments of that track were destroyed, parts of the concrete chute turned into rubble by the rushing water.
A flash flood hit the nearby Austrian town of Hallein late Saturday, but there were no reports of casualties. Farther west, flooding struck parts of the town of Kufstein. Heavy rain and storms caused serious damage in several parts of Austria.
In the eastern Belgian town of Pepinster, soldiers and firefighters on Sunday searched the wreckage for any remaining survivors or bodies, according to public broadcaster RTBF. All the houses still standing have been searched, so the effort focused on those that collapsed and in a valley downstream for anyone possibly swept away by the raging torrent.
The ground in the town remains unstable and several more houses could collapse. “We have to be careful with every step we take,” fire officer Olivier Jiust was quoted as saying.
Pope Francis prayed for the flood victims and in support of the “efforts of all to help those who suffered great damage.”
“I express my closeness to the populations of Germany, Belgium and Holland, hit by catastrophic flooding,” he said Sunday in his first public appearance to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square after major surgery. “May the Lord welcome the deceased and comfort the family members.”
Residents in the devastated areas will be needing support and comfort for a long time yet.
“This flood will leave scars on the people of Schuld — scars that you don’t forget, that can’t be overcome, because our lives changed from one day to the next,” Mayor Helmut Lussi said, breaking into sobs as he spoke."

The German chancellor, who is not seeking another term in September elections, is nearing the end of a political career that has spanned four American presidencies.
Merkel started her day with a working breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Harris’ office said the two had a “very candid discussion.”
“In part, this is a farewell visit. In part, she is signaling continuity and stability in the German-U.S. relationship,” said Johannes Thimm, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin.
Back home,  Germany and neighboring Belgium dealt with the aftermath of heavy flooding that left more than 40 people dead and dozens missing.
“My sympathy goes to the relatives and of the dead and missing,” Merkel  said.






World & Nation
Some similar underpinnings are seen in far-right violence in Germany and the United States.





Officials in Washington and elsewhere are wondering what course Germany might take after the September vote. The chancellor will seek to reassure the Americans that there won’t be a huge shift, Thimm said.
Merkel’s party is leading in polls, but the environmentalist Greens and the center-left Social Democrats are also vying to lead a future government. While the three parties differ in many policy areas, all are committed to a strong trans-Atlantic relationship.
One sour note that preceded and outlasted the Trump era of diplomatic discord has been a new pipeline taking natural gas from Russia to Germany.

The United States has long argued that the Nord Stream 2 project will threaten European energy security by increasing the continent’s reliance on Russian gas and allowing Russia to exert political pressure on vulnerable Eastern and Central European nations. But Biden recently waived sanctions against German entities involved in the project, a move that angered many in Congress.
World & Nation
During Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis, Germany took in more than 1 million newcomers, sparking a backlash by some. Five years on, tensions have eased.





Biden is expected to raise his concerns about the pipeline project with Merkel, but the White House was not anticipating any sort of formal announcement to come from their talks, according to a Biden administration official who briefed reporters before Merkel’s visit.
Merkel has tried to dampen expectations for an imminent breakthrough, but she probably will want to resolve the issue before leaving office. “It weighs on German-U.S. relations and German-EU relations,” Thimm said.
While German officials have been unusually coy about which topics will be discussed during the trip, Merkel’s spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that China will come up.
“That can be said with relative certainty,” Steffen Seibert told reporters. “This also played an important role at the G-7 summit, where the chancellor and the American president last met.”
Germany has strong trade ties with China but has also been critical of Beijing’s human rights record. Merkel is keen to avoid a situation in which Germany, or the European Union, might be forced to choose sides between China and the United States.
Merkel has insisted on the need to cooperate with China on global issues such as climate change and the coronavirus pandemic, even while then-President Trump was accusing Beijing of having started it.
The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders urged Biden to lean on Merkel to drop her opposition to proposals for suspending vaccine patents. Merkel, a trained scientist, has argued that lifting the patents wouldn’t be effective and could harm future research and development efforts.
A group of Democratic lawmakers called on Germany to drop its “blockade” of a COVID-19-related waiver of intellectual property rights under global trade rules. Such a waiver, the lawmakers argued, would help scale production of effective vaccines around the world.
The Biden administration has expressed support for the waiver being discussed at the World Trade Organization, but White House officials do not anticipate differences being resolved during Merkel’s visit.
While there are points of tension, Biden seems eager to offer Merkel a proper farewell.
Harris hosted Merkel for breakfast at her residence on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory before Merkel’s afternoon meeting with Biden and a joint news conference. The president plans a small dinner in honor of Merkel.
Harris greeted Merkel as she arrived at the residence and commended the chancellor for her “extraordinary career.” Merkel in turn noted the historic nature of the Harris vice presidency.
“I can only say that I’m delighted, too, for this opportunity here to meet the first madam vice president of the United States of America,” Merkel said before the two leaders stepped into a residence to talk over a breakfast of Gruyère soufflé, seasonal fruit and charcuterie.

Projections by public broadcaster ARD put Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union at 36.2%, a gain of more than 6 percentage points compared with the last election five years ago in the sparsely populated state of 2.2 million inhabitants.
The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, was projected to get 22.5% of the vote, a slight drop compared with 2016’s vote. The party has moved steadily further to the right in recent years, and its chapter in Saxony-Anhalt has come under increased scrutiny from Germany’s domestic intelligence service for its ties to extremist groups.

Hundreds of people attended a memorial service at Calvary Chapel Yorba Linda, where Aiden Leos was remembered for his ability to empathize with others. A reward for information about the fatal shooting grew to $500,000.

Although elections in Germany’s 16 states are often influenced by local issues and voting sentiments, they are also seen as important bellwethers for the national mood. A strong win for the CDU would be seen as a sign that the party’s new leader, Armin Laschet, could hope for support from both conservatives and centrists on Sept. 26, when it aims to hold on to power at the federal level despite four-term chancellor Merkel not running again.
The election result, if projections based on partial counts are confirmed, would be a strong endorsement for incumbent governor Reiner Haseloff of the CDU, who now has the comfort of being able to pick from three possible coalitions with smaller parties.
The 67-year-old Haseloff, whose popularity in the state was a strong pull for voters, ruled out any cooperation with AfD or the ex-communist Left party, who were projected to get 10.9% of the vote — a record low in the state.
The center-left Social Democrats also fared worse than five years ago and were expected to get about 8.4%, while the environmentalist Greens made modest gains to take 6.2%. Projections also showed that the pro-business Free Democrats entered the state assembly again after missing out five years ago, receiving 6.5%.

Haseloff expressed relief that voters backed centrist parties at the expense of the political fringes, saying the outcome showed a “big, big majority had made a democratic choice and drawn a clear demarcation line to the right.”
AfD campaigned strongly against pandemic restrictions, and its election posters urged voters to demonstrate their “resistance” at the ballot box."

The two leaders, whose countries are pillars of the transatlantic alliance, discussed a range of issues where they have common ground: climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and security challenges in Afghanistan, Iran, Libya and eastern Europe.
But they also tried to bridge two gaps between them, involving  Russia’s nearly complete Nord Stream II gas pipeline to Germany, which the United States opposed, and the administration’s desire for Germany to take a tougher stance toward China, its largest trading partner.
Biden called Merkel “a great friend, a personal friend and a friend of the United States” in comments to reporters as the two leaders began their meeting. He heaped more praise on her at a news conference later, thanking her for “strong, principled leadership” and being “a stalwart champion of the transatlantic alliance.”
Merkel, whose relations with former President Trump were notably tense, said at the outset, “I am very much looking forward to deepening the relationship again.” Later she twice described the meetings with Biden as “very friendly” and told reporters the two nations “share the same values” and are equally determined to tackle international problems “at a crucial moment.”
The chancellor began her day at a working breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris,  and near its end joined Biden in signing a formal declaration for future cooperation on the array of global challenges. They capped the visit with a ceremonial dinner that included officials from both countries.
Among the Americans was a bipartisan group of invitees including two former secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell, Congress’ two top Republicans — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield — and Stephen Hadley, former President George W. Bush’s national security advisor.
Biden, responding to several questions at the news conference that were unrelated to U.S.-German relations, said he was not considering sending military troops to Haiti amid the unrest following the assassination of its president; called Cuba, which has been engulfed by protests over food and medicine shortages, “a failed state”; and expressed guarded confidence that he would achieve his agenda in Congress for infrastructure and social spending.
The looming departure of Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving and most important leader, could complicate Biden’s efforts to renew multilateral relations with allies after their tensions with Trump, and to solidify the alliance as a bulwark against Russian and Chinese aggression. Merkel is expected to leave the chancellorship after German elections in September.

“She’s always infuriated her peers with her ambiguities, but in truth she was actually very predictable,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Merkel’s departure and replacement by a less experienced successor, she continued, “introduces an element of uncertainty at a time when allies would like to have more certainty in the capital of Europe’s anchor economy.”
Politics
President Biden builds bridges at NATO summit, after Trump belittled the alliance. Allies support his upcoming meeting with Russia’s Putin, he says.

On the issues that divided Biden and Merkel, he could be helped by the fact that German public opinion has turned against China and the Nord Stream II pipeline.
The pipeline, which bypasses the key gas route through Ukraine to connect Russia and Germany directly, could be completed by August but has become less popular given Germans’ concerns about the  risk from Russia to Ukraine’s security. Also, German intelligence officials have issued dire warnings about Russian and Chinese meddling in the country’s upcoming elections “at levels not seen since the Cold War.”
Merkel’s reluctance to confront China “has alarmed policymakers in Germany,” Stelzenmüller said. “Managing China’s rise will require using our considerable trade, technological and regulatory leverage to delineate clearer red lines. That is where Merkel has been overtaken by shifts in expert and also public opinion.”

At the news conference, Merkel affirmed Biden’s positions on China related to fair trade, human rights and the territorial sovereignty of Hong Kong, stating that there is “a common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor.” She added, “How we deal with China ought to rest — and does rest — on our shared values.”
Merkel reaffirmed her support for an infrastructure bank, a Biden proposal to have the world’s largest democracies offer financing to developing countries as a more transparent and energy-efficient alternative to Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Politics
Biden and Blinken toured Europe to restore alliances damaged by Trump, but did they make progress on a united front against China?

On Nord Stream II, the State Department last spring eased off the threat of sanctions over the project, partly because the pipeline’s imminent completion rendered it a moot point. But Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans have held up Senate confirmation of Biden’s nominee to head the CIA until the administration imposes sanctions against companies helping Russia’s state energy company on the pipeline.
Biden said imposing sanctions on a nearly completed project “didn’t make a lot of sense.” He did secure a pledge from Merkel to counter Russia should it use the pipeline to threaten Ukraine.
“Our idea is and remains that Ukraine remains a transit country for natural gas, and that Ukraine has a right to territorial sovereignty,” Merkel said. “We will be actively acting should Russia not respect this right.”
She did not elaborate on what that action might be. Biden said both countries would look for “practical measures” they could take in such a scenario.

Despite pressure from Republicans in Congress, Biden had appeared eager to find  a middle ground on the pipeline dispute, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm in New York. “He does not want to have problems with the Russians while he’s focusing on China, and he also wants to be seen as more aligned with the Europeans.”
Biden, who has met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin as well as Merkel, has invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for a meeting this summer, though no date has been set."

https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-24/mccarthy-biden-fractured-relationship;2022-05-24;What McCarthy and Biden's lack of relationship means if House flips - Los Angeles Times;"As the United States hastily exited Afghanistan last year, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy dialed up the White House’s public switchboard number to lodge his anger over the messy withdrawal.
The Bakersfield Republican got a quizzical call back from a White House staffer who wanted to know if it was actually him who left a message, according to McCarthy’s retelling during a record-long House floor speech in November. President Biden followed up with a call, in which the two men clashed over the last Americans left in the country as the U.S.’ longest war ended.
It was the only publicly known one-on-one call during the first 16 months of the Biden administration between the president and the man who could be speaker of the House next year, political rivals who would be part of the small cadre of elected leaders responsible for keeping the government funded and avoiding a catastrophic default on the nation’s debt.
If, as is widely expected, Republicans win control of the House in this fall’s midterm elections, the lack of a personal relationship between the two leaders could have significant, wide-ranging consequences for governing. Anything Biden wants to get through Congress — including must-pass bills such as a debt limit increase, response to a natural disaster and other ambitious legislation — would run through a potentially tumultuous House lacking any leader who shares a history with the president.
As McCarthy recounted the switchboard story on Fox News last week, he called it “the one time the president actually took my call.”
It’s unclear whether McCarthy had no other contact information for a senior White House staffer who could connect him to the president or favored the political theater of a call to the public White House number. McCarthy’s office declined to answer questions about the call or any other attempt to reach out to Biden. The Biden administration did not dispute the account and declined to share any details on its interactions with McCarthy.
There is a long history of friendly or adversarial relationships between speakers of one party and presidents of the other. Most famously, Republican President Reagan enjoyed a friendly partnership with Democratic Speaker Tip O’Neill. At the other end of the spectrum, Speaker Nancy Pelosi openly feuded with President Trump. Speaker John A. Boehner vacillated between sparring with President Obama and cutting deals over cigarettes (Boehner’s) and Nicorette gum (Obama’s).
A lot has changed since the Reagan-O’Neill years. Biden and McCarthy will have to find a way to work together, assuming Republicans take control of the House. But each also has reasons to keep that relationship largely at arm’s length. McCarthy, in particular, can’t be seen as too chummy with a Democratic president, for fear of inciting a revolt among more hard-edged conservatives in his caucus, who already suspect him of not really being one of them.

“Each speaker progressively gets less leash on this kind of thing these days,” said Brendan Buck, who was a senior advisor to GOP Speakers Boehner and Paul D. Ryan. “So I don’t think Kevin’s going have a ton of latitude to buddy-buddy partner with the president, but I don’t think he has any real interest in that either.”
A significant unknown that will factor into the mix is which party controls the Senate. Biden has a much longer relationship with Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican who would be majority leader if his party takes control of that chamber. Though Biden leveraged that relationship to enact a bipartisan infrastructure package last year, little else has come from the pairing.
McCarthy is far from a frequent visitor to the White House. He went a year ago as part of a meeting between Biden and the four congressional leaders. He also attended a social dinner with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a small number of other U.S. politicians last year.
“He hasn’t been working with us. I’ve only seen the president a couple times,” McCarthy said of Biden on Fox. “He’s never called to ask. I’ve reached out numerous times.”
Biden, for his part, has repeatedly expressed his lack of familiarity with the current crop of GOP leaders. “All kidding aside, this is a MAGA party now,” Biden said last month at an Earth Day event. “These guys are a different breed of cat. They are not like what I served with for so many years.”
The Trump presidency and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection have frozen many of the existing bipartisan relationships on Capitol Hill. And with Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress, they have focused on pushing legislation through a fast-track legislative process that didn’t require Republicans. They successfully moved one COVID-19 relief measure through that process but failed to enact Biden’s social spending and climate bill.
Republicans expect that attitude to change if their party takes at least one house of Congress.
“Maybe it’s optimism, but I think it will change when [Biden] wants his second two years to be — I would imagine you want them to be somewhat productive,” said Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale). “That means our side will actually have to be sitting around hashing some stuff.”
Neither Biden nor White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain are known to have productive relationships with House Republicans, said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), who is close with House leadership. He recounted a White House event that a few House Republicans were invited to early in the Biden presidency.
“But outreach is a concerted effort. It’s not a one-time affair,” he said. “This White House has gone back to a less successful way of working with Hill leaders, frankly, to their own peril, to their detriment. They’re going to have to shift if Republicans take control in a mighty way if they hope to have any success.”
Perhaps the most significant question facing McCarthy will be how much latitude his own party gives him to work with his political adversary, especially on something as politically unpopular with Republicans as raising the debt limit.
“It’s never popular in your own party, and more specifically within your own conference, to be working too closely with a Democratic president,” Buck said. “Kevin will always have to balance being the loyal opposition with the basic necessities of governance that come along with being speaker of the House.”
Both Ryan and Boehner were routinely challenged by that seesaw. At one point in mid-2011, Boehner secretly went to the White House to negotiate details of a debt limit increase with Obama to avoid angering his members.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) pointed to the recent bipartisan approval of $40-billion Ukraine relief legislation as a sign that McCarthy can deliver his conference on a bill of international importance that the GOP didn’t love.
“I know Leader McCarthy was not happy about the process; no Republican would be,” Cole said. “I heard him talk about how important it was for the country to be united, to project the common image here. … He stepped up even when there was considerable hesitation in certain portions of his caucus.”
Cole placed hope in the fact that both McCarthy and Biden are skilled politicians who thrive on personal relationships.
“They’re naturally gregarious people,” Cole said. Biden “is a hail-fellow-well-met classic politician who likes to make a deal, and so is Kevin. Their consuming singular interest is politics. So I actually can see the basis of some really good deals.”"

Deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. reach 200,000 as authorities across the country continue to struggle to curb its spread.

Meanwhile, new restrictions went into effect in several other European nations in an effort to staunch the resurgence of the pandemic.
In Paris and eight other French cities, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other establishments were being forced to close no later than 9 p.m. to try to reduce contact among people. The country was deploying 12,000 extra police officers to enforce the new rules.
Many restaurant owners have bristled at the order. An earlier months-long lockdown devastated the sector.
“I have the right to question the government’s approach, I think it’s a catastrophic measure for the industry,” said Xavier Denamur, who owns Les Philosophes and several other bistros in Paris’s chic Le Marais district, saying that if nothing else, the curfew should be 11 p.m.
“At least that would not destroy us,” he said. “There’s no evidence that this difference of a couple of hours will have any effect on the virus circulating.”

In Britain, a three-tier regional approach to battle the pandemic introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson went into effect, with each level bringing progressively tighter restrictions.
On Saturday, tier-2 cities like London and York were subject to a ban on socializing with people from other households indoors, while the county of Lancashire joined Liverpool in tier 3 with the tightest restrictions.
Among other things, that means pubs have been forced to close and socializing with others is banned even in many outdoor settings.
In Northern Ireland a lockdown lasting four weeks came into force Friday. All pubs and restaurants must close except for takeout services, and schools will close for two weeks for an extended half-term holiday.
Data from Friday showed that 136 more people died in the U.K. within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total official death toll to 43,429.
The World Health Organization has warned that intensive care units in a number of European cities could reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks if the number of infections doesn’t slow.
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg joined the list of top politicians who have tested positive for the virus, and was quarantined though he showed no symptoms, his office told Austria’s APA news agency.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the country’s head of state, was quarantined after a bodyguard was infected, his office said. A first test came out negative.
Germany, which was widely lauded for rapidly slowing the spread of the virus when the pandemic first broke out, has seen rapidly climbing numbers in recent days.
On Saturday, the country’s disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 7,830 cases overnight, a new record.
Like most countries, Germany has been grappling with how to keep schools and businesses open while trying to prevent people from coming into close contact with one another.
Germany has registered a total of 356,387 coronavirus cases and a relatively low 9,767 deaths.
Merkel urged Germans to avoid unnecessary travel, cancel parties and remain at home whenever possible.
“What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic?” she asked. “It was that we stood together and obeyed the rules out of consideration and common sense. This is the most effective remedy we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever.”
In the neighboring Czech Republic, the number of new infections surpassed 10,000 for the first time, surging to 11,105 on Friday, the Health Ministry said. The country has now registered a total of 160,112 cases, including 1,283 deaths.
Despite new restrictive measures to slow the surge, Health Minister Roman Prymula said he still expects a rise in those testing positive for about two weeks.
Next door, Slovakia said it was acquiring 13 million rapid antigen tests — enough to test each member of the population twice — and would establish 6,000 testing sites.
Prime Minister Igor Matovic said testing will take place over the next two weekends, starting with the three or four hardest hit counties. It was not immediately clear whether tests would be mandatory.
Italy’s northern Lombardy region, where the European outbreak began in late February, has taken new measures to contain rebounding infections, limiting bar service and alcohol sales, banning contact sports and closing bingo parlors.
The regional government late Friday called for high schools to adopt hybrid schedules, with students alternating in-person with online learning.
The measures were taken after Lombardy, Italy’s most populous region, once again became the most affected, adding more than 2,000 infections a day. Hospitals are coming under strain and intensive care units are filling up.
The new measures allow only table service for bars from 6 p.m., ban takeout alcohol sales from that time and prohibit all consumption of booze in public spaces.
Italy’s other hardest hit region, southern Campania, has taken similarly strict measures, including a shutdown of schools for two weeks. After parents protested, the regional governor backed off Friday and allowed daycare centers to remain open.
In the capital, Rome, residents grumbled as cases climbed, fearing a return to the strict country-wide measures that were imposed when the virus was spreading out of control.
“The situation is critical thanks to the morons, because I call them morons, who have not respected the rules,” said resident Mario Massenzi. “And if we fall back into the same situation as in March, we are finished.”"
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-16/germany-merkels-party-elects-pragmatic-laschet-as-leader;2021-01-16;In Germany, Angela Merkel's party elects the pragmatic Armin Laschet as leader - Los Angeles Times;"Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right party on Saturday chose Armin Laschet, the pragmatic governor of Germany’s most populous state, as its new leader — sending a signal of continuity months before an election in which voters will decide who becomes the new chancellor.
Laschet will have to build unity in the Christian Democratic Union, Germany’s strongest party, after beating more conservative rival Friedrich Merz. And he will need to plunge straight into an electoral marathon that culminates with the Sept. 26 national vote.
Saturday’s vote isn’t the final word on who will run as the center-right CDU’s candidate for chancellor in September, but Laschet will either run himself or have a big say in who does. He didn’t address his plans at Saturday’s convention.
Laschet, 59, was elected in 2017 as governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, a traditionally center-left stronghold.
He governs the region in a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats, the CDU’s traditional ally, but would likely be able to work smoothly with a more liberal partner, too. Current polls point to the environmentalist Greens as a likely key to power in the election.
Laschet pointed Saturday to the value of continuity and moderation, and cited the storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Trump as an example of where polarization can lead.
“Trust is what keeps us going and what has been broken in America,” he told delegates before the vote. “By polarizing, sowing discord and distrust, and systematically lying, a president has destroyed stability and trust.”
“We must speak clearly but not polarize,” Laschet said. “We must be able to integrate, hold society together.”

He said that the party needs “the continuity of success” and “we will only win if we remain strong in the middle of society.”
Laschet said that “there are many people who, above all, find Angela Merkel good and only after that the CDU.” He added that ”we need this trust now as a party” and that “we must work for this trust.”
Laschet beat Merz, a former rival of Merkel who was making his second attempt in recent years to win the CDU leadership, by 521 votes to 466. A third candidate, prominent lawmaker Norbert Roettgen, was eliminated in a first round of voting.
Merz’s sizable support suggests that a strong contingent would like a sharper conservative profile after the Merkel years. Merkel has led Germany since 2005 but said over two years ago that she wouldn’t seek a fifth term as chancellor.
Merkel, 66, has enjoyed enduring popularity with voters as she steered Germany and Europe through a series of crises. But she repeatedly abandoned orthodox conservative policies, for example by accelerating Germany’s exit from nuclear energy and ending military conscription.
Her decision in 2015 to allow in large numbers of migrants caused major tensions on the center-right and strengthened the far-right Alternative for Germany party.
Saturday’s vote ends a nearly yearlong limbo in Germany’s strongest party since outgoing leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who narrowly beat Merz in 2018 to succeed Merkel as CDU leader but failed to impose her authority, announced her resignation. A vote on her successor was delayed twice because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Laschet called for unity after Saturday’s vote and said Merz remains “an important personality for us.”
“All the questions that will face us after the pandemic need a broad consensus in our party,” he said. “And we will need this consensus for all the elections that are ahead of us, too. Everyone will be against us.”
Laschet, a miner’s son who served as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2005, shouldn’t expect much of a honeymoon in his new job. In addition to the national election, Germany is holding six state elections this year, the first two in mid-March.

Germany is gradually moving toward a tighter lockdown, at least for a limited period after Christmas, as new coronavirus infections remain stubbornly high — and are even beginning to creep higher — despite a partial shutdown that started Nov. 2.
The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 590 deaths related to COVID-19 over the last 24 hours — more than 100 higher than the week-old previous record. It counted 20,815 new daily infections, compared with 17,270 a week earlier.
Germany, which has 83 million people and was lauded for its coronavirus response early on in the pandemic, has now recorded nearly 1.22 million cases, including 19,932 deaths. Those figures remain far lower than the caseloads and death tolls in other European countries such as France, Spain and Britain.
“We are in a decisive, perhaps the decisive, phase of fighting the pandemic,” Merkel told lawmakers Wednesday.
“The figures are at much too high a level,” she said, looking visibly frustrated. She described as “very alarming” the rising number of people requiring intensive care and dying.
World & Nation
The U.K. says two people with a ‘significant history’ of allergic reactions responded adversely to Pfizer’s COVID-19 shot but are ‘recovering well.’

Merkel has consistently advocated decisive action to fight the pandemic but has often had to move more slowly because, in highly decentralized Germany, the country’s 16 state governments are responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions. She and the state governors meet periodically to coordinate measures.

Restaurants, bars and leisure and sports facilities are currently closed in Germany, and hotels are closed to tourists. Schools and nonessential shops remain open.
Last spring, Germany managed to avoid the high number of infections and grim death tolls seen in other large European nations, but the current trend is not encouraging. Its rate of new cases per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days now surpasses that of France, Belgium and Spain, and is about level with Britain, but still well below Italy, Sweden and many others, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
Merkel noted that a national academy of scientists and academics recommended Tuesday that Germans reduce their social contacts starting next week and put in place a “hard lockdown” from Dec. 24 to Jan. 10.
“We would do well to really take seriously what scientists tell us,” she said.
World & Nation
The German government is preparing to roll out a nationwide coronavirus vaccine program as it hits the milestone of 1 million confirmed cases.

Merkel called for state governments to consider closing schools early before Christmas and said that people hopping from one mulled-wine stand to the next over the holidays is “unacceptable” in view of the daily death figures.
“If we have too many contacts before Christmas and then it’s our last Christmas with our grandparents, then we will have been negligent,” she said.
Some state governors are already moving to toughen restrictions. The eastern state of Saxony, currently the worst-hit, will close schools and most stores Monday until Jan. 10. Its southern neighbor, Bavaria, is introducing measures such as a nighttime curfew in its worst-affected areas and demanding more home-schooling and stricter border controls.
Most Germans have supported restrictions and mask-wearing requirements, although a small but vocal minority opposes them. There have been protests that have drawn a wide variety of participants, including right-wing extremists and conspiracy theorists.

On Wednesday, domestic intelligence officials in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said they were putting a group organizing those protests, Querdenken 711, under formal observation.
The group insists that it is not extremist. But Beate Bube, the head of the state’s domestic intelligence agency, said the group has membership and ideological overlaps with known right-wing extremist groups.
“Extremist, conspiracy ideology and anti-Semitic content are being deliberately mixed with legitimate criticism of state measures to contain the corona pandemic,” she said."
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-10/five-years-after-migrant-influx-germany-settles-in;2020-09-10;5 years after massive influx, migrants in Germany settle in  - Los Angeles Times;"The selfie that changed both his life and Angela Merkel’s was snapped soon after Rodin Saouan arrived in Berlin in 2015. He’d spent more than a year trying to reach Germany from war-ravaged Syria, traveling on foot, by car, bus, truck and tractor and aboard an unseaworthy rubber dinghy packed with 44 refugees making the perilous crossing from Turkey to Greece.
Exactly five years ago Thursday, Saouan suddenly found himself standing just a few feet  from Merkel, who had dropped by a refugee center in Berlin on an unannounced visit. With a smartphone in his hand and a smile on his face, Saouan, then 25, approached Germany’s chancellor, signaling hopefully that he wanted a picture together.
“My German wasn’t very good at the time, so all I could say was ‘Guten tag,’” Saouan recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “She was just standing there with several bodyguards and staff workers and looking a little bit nervous. But she smiled at me and let me take the selfie.
“I was a little surprised it was possible. She then asked me where I came from, and I told her from Syria.”
Photos of the two posing together were featured on newscasts and in newspapers around the world. For Saouan, the improbable encounter inaugurated his new life in a foreign but peaceful land far from his original home. For Merkel, it became a symbol of her surprising decision, just a few days earlier, to abandon her usual caution and put out the welcome mat for what eventually became an influx of 1.1 million migrants and asylum seekers in Germany that year.
The move was initially hailed as a moral triumph for a country burdened with a dreadful history of fascism and genocide. Then came the backlash, against Merkel, her party and some of the new arrivals themselves, as the practical challenges of sheltering and integrating so many people grew apparent. U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump accused Merkel of “ruining Germany,” her popularity plunged, allies of her conservative party lost elections and right-wing dissent — some of it violent — surged.

Migrants and asylum-seekers are increasingly crossing a treacherous part of the Atlantic Ocean to reach the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago.

But five years later, the situation has settled to a significant degree as Germans set about absorbing the newcomers with their trademark pragmatism. Though there have been missteps and continued criticism that Germany has been overwhelmed by the new arrivals, and though far-right sentiment lingers, Merkel’s approval ratings have hit new heights, in part because of her able management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and tensions over the great in-migration of 2015 have largely eased, analysts say.
“What is striking is the perception in Germany and that the public has settled on a surprisingly positive narrative,” said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative think tank in Berlin and an advisor to Merkel on refugee issues. “The consensus two years ago looked more controversial. But now two years on, the mainstream opinion is that it all worked surprisingly well.

“Most Germans are content and proud of what they’ve done,” Knaus added. “And that’s a very important signal for democracies.”
In a poll last month, a majority of Germans said their country had accepted the right number of refugees or should have taken in even more. Overall, Germany welcomed more asylum seekers and migrants in 2015 — during Europe’s biggest migration crisis since World War II — than the rest of the 27 European Union member states combined.
Saouan, now 30, can’t understand the heat that Merkel took, including over his famous selfie with her, which critics said only encouraged more people to strike out for Germany from such countries as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
“She was only helping people in a tough situation who needed help,” Saouan said. “What’s wrong with that?”
His adjustment to life in Germany hasn’t been without difficulty. After the relief of making it safely to what seemed the promised land, he and other migrants found themselves navigating a country with a tough language to learn and with such a bewildering abundance of rules and regulations that even applicants for work as a waiter or dishwasher need certificates documenting their training or skills.
Saouan now speaks German reasonably well, and tries to improve by watching lessons on YouTube. Although he has passed a series of proficiency tests that qualify him for various jobs, he’s bounced through a series of low-paying, part-time positions in pubs, restaurants and warehouses as well as undergone some bouts of unemployment.
“I had a part-time job as a barman and cook in a restaurant until March 1, but then the coronavirus came, and so I haven’t had much work since,” said Saouan, who lives in a small studio apartment that costs $500 a month.
“I’m hoping to find a good job with good pay and a real employment contract. The jobs I’ve been doing just don’t pay enough for the rent and everything else. I want to earn enough to take care of myself, but it’s a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.”

Sometimes he sneaks the old family photo down to his room because he likes it so much, even though it was taken long before he was alive, and even though it’s not his family.

Then there’s the bass note of homesickness that never quite fades. As an able-bodied young man, Saouan fled Syria out of fear of being recalled to the army to fight in the country’s brutal civil war, which went “against everything inside me.” His four brothers and sisters remain in their farming village near Damascus.
“I didn’t have a future in Syria,” he said. “But maybe I don’t have one in Germany either. Don’t get me wrong — I’m happy and glad to be here, away from the war. Germany has been very kind to me, but I don’t have any family here. … I’d like to find a woman I could marry and have children with. I’d like to meet someone with the same culture and religion. That’s important to me.”
Opponents of Merkel’s policies bemoan what they say is a lack of assimilation, as well as the competition that newcomers pose in Germany’s economy — which remains Europe’s biggest despite the pandemic.
“Millions of refugees have arrived in Germany but without any kind of integration into the labor market. One-quarter of the Syrians living here are on welfare,” Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany, said in parliament last week. “The heightened competition for housing and jobs among low-skilled workers has become a major burden, as have the added burdens on our social welfare system.”
World & Nation
Ingolf Koecher and his wife, Bettina, have marched in 120 anti-Islam rallies in the former East German city of Dresden during the last four years.

Critics also accuse Merkel of recklessly endangering Germans’ safety. They point to several high-profile crimes committed by migrants, including a large number of sexual assaults in Cologne during outdoor New Year’s Eve celebrations in 2015, several grisly murders and a handful of terror attacks.
Anger fueled by such incidents resulted in a series of losses for Merkel’s party in regional elections from 2016 to 2018. Under growing pressure, Merkel herself — who has governed Germany since 2005 — announced in late 2018 that she would not seek a fifth term as chancellor in next year’s election and gave up her post as chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union party.
Hostility toward asylum seekers has at times found violent expression. Some refugee centers were torched, and xenophobic hooligans beat up people who appeared to be foreigners. Anti-immigrant protests still crop up, often in eastern Germany, such as the city of Dresden. A number of refugees, weary of the resentment or of the stresses of living in such an unfamiliar environment, have gone on to other countries or returned to their homelands.
Here in more cosmopolitan Berlin, Saouan said he has not been subjected to any overt racism or resentment. The same goes for Mohamed Rachid, whose family, from the devastated Syrian city of Aleppo, spent more than a year in a refugee camp in Turkey before being taken by smugglers, at dawn, on a treacherous five-hour boat ride to Greece in August 2015.
Rachid arrived in Germany as a 16-year-old with his parents and four siblings — and little knowledge of his new host country. Now 21, he speaks German fluently, is a hard-working and well-liked trainee at a busy Berlin barbershop and evinces a confidence, optimism and determination that not many native Germans his age seem to possess.
“My dream is to open my own shop in a couple of years,” Rachid said. “I’ve got another 11 months to go as an intern here, and then I’ll work in a hair salon for two or three years to save up as much as I can, and then hopefully I can open up my own shop. I’m sure it’s all going to work out well.”
Knaus, the think tank director, said stories like Rachid’s are more typical among younger migrants with strong family networks around them. He said that 50% of Germany’s refugees have either found a job or enrolled in school or a vocational training program.
Rachid and his two sisters, who have internships of their own at a postal delivery company and at a supermarket chain, were recently given their own apartment to share, costing $500 per month. His siblings, Rachid said, are as ambitious as he is.
“I’ve learned a lot during the internship and am confident I can make it work with my own shop,” he said. “It’s only going to be a small shop. … But it’s going to be great.”
Two weeks ago, as the fifth anniversary of her momentous decision on migration neared, Merkel was asked yet again whether she regretted throwing open her country to the hundreds of thousands of people streaming in from the east, through Hungary and Austria, to Germany’s doorstep in the hope of finding a better life.
“I would make essentially the same decisions again,” Merkel said of a bold and controversial move that will inevitably be seen as part of her legacy as chancellor, for good or ill. “I am for the most part satisfied with the way it all went, even if there has been some hardship.
“When people are standing at the German-Austrian border or the Hungarian-Austrian border, they have to be treated like human beings.”

After canceling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic.
Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the DPA news agency she has now made a decision.
“As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change."
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-13/merkel-evidence-of-russian-role-in-german-parliament-hack;2020-05-13;Merkel says there's evidence of Russian role in German Parliament hack - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that there is “hard evidence” of Russian involvement in a cyberattack on the German Parliament in 2015 that reportedly also involved the theft of documents from her parliamentary office.
The German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported last week that federal prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant against an alleged officer with Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency identified as Dmitriy Badin, who already is being sought by U.S. authorities. On Friday, the newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported that correspondence from Merkel’s parliamentary office was among the documents targeted in the 2015 hack.
Prosecutors haven’t confirmed those reports, but Merkel was asked about the theft of data from her office in a question-and-answer session with lawmakers in Parliament on Wednesday. She replied: “I get the impression that they picked up relatively indiscriminately what they could get.”
“I am very glad that the investigations have now led to the federal prosecutor putting a concrete person on the wanted list,” Merkel said, without elaborating. “I take these things very seriously.”
“I can say honestly that this pains me: On the one hand, I work every day for a better relationship with Russia, and when you see on the other hand that there is such hard evidence that Russian forces are involved in acting this way, this is an area of tension,” she added.
Russian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement by Moscow in the 2015 hacking attack, calling the German accusations groundless. They have similarly dismissed charges of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and alleged cyberattacks on other Western nations and institutions.
Merkel indicated that the German investigation doesn’t change her assessment of Russia’s tactics, pointing to a strategy of “hybrid warfare, which includes warfare in connection with cyber, disorientation and factual distortion.”
She said there is every reason to keep up efforts for a good relationship with Russia, “but this naturally doesn’t make it easier.”

The chancellor described such actions as “outrageous” and said that “of course we always reserve the right to take measures, including against Russia.”"

Shortly after the 65-year-old German leader announced a further clampdown Sunday outlawing nearly all public and private gatherings, the government released a statement saying she was in quarantine at home because a physician who administered her a pneumococcal vaccine had since  tested positive for the infection.
“The chancellor decided immediately to go into quarantine at home,” the government statement said. “She will be tested regularly over the next few days because a test at this point would be inconclusive. The chancellor will continue working in her quarantine at home.”
Merkel did not know about the positive test until right after the news conference ended, an official said.
Merkel had spent 20 minutes talking to reporters about new rules on social distancing in Germany that the federal government and 16 governors agreed to during a teleconference Sunday aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus after the number of confirmed cases in Germany rose toward 24,000. The new rules outlaw more than two people from gathering — with the exception of immediate family members — and will be in place for at least two weeks. The regulations also provide power to police to investigate and break up private house parties.
The rules fall slightly short of lockdown provisions imposed in neighboring countries France, Belgium, Denmark and Poland, as well as in other European Union countries Italy, Spain and Ireland.
German leaders including Merkel, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in then-Communist East Germany, have been consciously sensitive about temporarily restricting civil liberties in part because of the nation’s totalitarian past.
“For someone like me, who fought hard to be able to travel freely and move about freely, that would be justifiable if absolutely necessary,” she said last week.
Merkel told reporters Sunday that her life had changed dramatically in recent days.
“I canceled almost all of my appointments in which people come in here to my offices to see me or to places where I would normally visit,” she said. “My life has changed completely and is mainly made up right now of telephone calls and video conferences.”

Among the other new restrictions imposed Sunday are: closure of hairdressers, massage studios and tattoo parlors; and restaurants limited to takeout and delivery. Most other shops and businesses in Germany were already ordered closed last week.
“The overwhelming majority have understood what’s needed,” she said, referring to a sharp decline in public activity in recent days. “This is how we’re going to save lives.”

in her first such direct TV address to the nation in her nearly 15 years as chancellor, Merkel implored Germans to heed the government’s increasingly stringent but still-voluntary advisories on avoiding public gatherings. She also hinted that Germany might still have to order a lockdown, as has already been imposed in Italy, France, Spain and Belgium.
“The situation is serious — take it seriously,” said Merkel, who plans to retire in 2021. “Not since German reunification — no, not since World War II — has our country faced a challenge that has required such a high degree of common and united action. I’m convinced that we can succeed as long as everyone truly understands what’s needed.”
Although many of the 82 million living in Germany have followed government guidelines on social distancing and shutting down most nonessential businesses, some younger people in particular have bristled at the clampdown and cited the comparatively low risk of serious health complications for younger and healthy people.
Many parks have been filled in recent days, some of the first warm and sunny days of the year, with significant gatherings of people defying the advisories, even as nightclubs shut down.
“The coronavirus has dramatically changed our lives,” Merkel said. “We’re all full of questions and worries about what’s going to happen next.”
Thanks to its strong healthcare system, national health insurance for everyone, its vast network of hospitals and its high per-capita numbers of intensive care beds, Germany has so far succeeded in keeping its mortality rate associated with the coronavirus extremely low compared with other countries.
“Our healthcare system is perhaps one of the best in the world,” she said. “But the epidemic is showing us all how vulnerable we actually are and how dependent we are on others.”
Germany now has the fifth highest number of coronavirus cases confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins Cornavirus Resource Center, with 12,327 cases and 28 deaths.

“I urge all of you to follow the rules,” Merkel said. “We’ll continuously examine the situation and check to see if we need to make changes and to see what’s possibly still needed” to be done, a warning that a lockdown was still possible.
Merkel, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in communist East Germany, made it clear that she did not want to have to impose any further restrictions on freedom of movement as other countries have this week.
“For someone like me, who fought hard to be able to travel freely and move about freely, that would be justifiable if absolutely necessary,” she said."
https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-11/germany-coronavirus-merkel;2020-03-11;Coronavirus: Up to 70% of Germany could become infected, Merkel warns - Los Angeles Times;"Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that a substantial majority of the German population was likely to be infected with the coronavirus.
Citing expert estimates, Merkel said that 60% to 70% of the population could be infected. She said the reason is because people do not yet have immunity to the virus and there are so far neither vaccines nor therapies to fight it. With some 1,300 infections and two deaths, Germany’s government has recommended the cancellation of all events with more than 1,000 people, among other measures. Merkel said such measures “are giving us time” and are invaluable.
The chancellor, speaking at a news conference in Berlin a day after the 27 European Union leaders held a video conference to coordinate action with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, said Germany will do whatever is required to limit the impact of the virus on Europe’s biggest economy.
She was referring to budget spending on health measures, on top of a pledge to provide ailing companies with liquidity and extend furlough pay for workers. She said she agreed with Lagarde that the situation must be taken “very seriously.”
Merkel and her economic team are focused on providing liquidity to cash-strapped companies and haven’t seen the need for classic stimulus measures until the economic fallout of the disease becomes more clear. Yet pressure has been growing for Germany to step up efforts to support growth.
Some of the nation’s leading economists on Wednesday urged the government to become more proactive and give up its balanced-budget policy. While the economists rejected a broader stimulus package, they called for targeted measures to cushion the economic impact, such as tax cuts and better terms on tax obligations.

The decision by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer came after a failed attempt to stop conservative Christian Democrats  lawmakers in the Thuringia region from cooperating with a far-right extremist party in a governor’s race. The move was unprecedented in post-World War II Germany and has hurt the stability of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s federal coalition with its center-left partners.
Kramp-Karrenbauer said Monday that the Christian Democrats party had been weakened by the split of the party leader and chancellor jobs in late 2018. Kramp-Karrenbauer became party leader while Merkel remained chancellor but said she would not run for a fifth term in an election scheduled for fall 2021.
”I will not be the candidate for chancellor,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference in Berlin. “We’re stronger when the two jobs are held by the same person. . . . I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, and the decision kept growing on me.”
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was elected party chair 14 months ago, was unable to stop her  Christian Democrat party members in Thuringia from aligning themselves with the normally ostracized Alternative for Germany  party. The governor who was elected and took office last week resigned two days later after the election result was condemned by Merkel and the nation saw widespread demonstrations from Germans incensed by the alliance with Alternative for Germany.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who will remain Germany’s defense minister, plans to stay on as party leader until a new one is chosen.
Analysts and former Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said her surprise announcement nevertheless could open the door for early elections this year.
“The chances of Merkel staying in power are a lot lower now,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University in an interview. “Merkel had hand-picked the weakest possible successor she could find in the hopes that she could stay in power as long as she wanted. The gamble didn’t work out. The party will likely pick a stronger successor now as party leader who won’t want to wait in the wings.”
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is more commonly known in Germany as “AKK” because of her tongue-twisting name, won a tense inner party battle against a conservative millionaire to lead the party but faced a steady drumbeat of criticism laced with sexism from allies of Friedrich Merz, once the party’s whip in parliament and more recently a businessman who has also taken over an advisory position in the party.

“This is an unusually grave situation for the Christian Democrats — for all Christian Democrats,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a close Merkel ally, told reporters outside  Christian Democrat party headquarters ahead of a meeting with other leaders to discuss the resignation.
The Christian Democrats, who have ruled Germany for 51 of the last 71 years, have been the epitome of stability for most of those decades. Merkel, chancellor since 2005, was the party leader for 18 years before turning over the reins to Kramp-Karrenbauer in late 2018 following a series of regional election defeats. And before her, Helmut Kohl was the party chair for 25 years and chancellor for 16 years.
“Our next candidate for chancellor won’t be elected as chancellor if we continue to carry on like this,” said Wolfgang Schaeuble, long a powerful leader in the  Christian Democrats who was briefly chairman as well in 1998 to 2000.
The conservatives long tried to conceal deeper divisions about Merkel, who gradually moved her party to the political center but upset many of its conservatives in the process. Her decision in 2015, for example, to open the country’s borders for more than  1 million refugees from Syria and troubled countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan deeply angered many conservatives and contributed to the rise of the  Alternative for Germany — which positioned itself as an anti-refugee, anti-Islam bastion. The  Alternative for Germany siphoned away millions of votes from the Christian Democrats and cost the party dearly in regional elections.
“I’ve got a lot of respect for AKK’s decision, but this still really hurts,” said Markus Soeder, the Bavarian governor and head of the Christian Social Union  in Bavaria who is considered by many to be a possible successor to Merkel. “It’s important that we thoroughly clear up the conservative position on policy and candidate.”
Other possible successors include Merz and Health Minister Jens Spahn, both of whom were defeated by Kramp-Karrenbauer in the December 2018 campaign for the party chair. Also mentioned as a possible successor to Merkel is Armin Laschet, the governor of Germany’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The conservatives are still Germany’s most popular party, according to opinion polls that put them at about 28% of eligible voters. The pro-environment Greens have climbed to about 22% while the center-left Social Democrats have fallen behind the Greens to 14%. The  Alternative for Germany  is at about 10% in opinion polls. The conservatives are currently in a grand coalition with the SPD.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-angela-merkel-health-20190711-story.html;2019-07-11;Germany’s Angela Merkel sits during national anthems, raising more health concerns - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel opted to sit for the playing of national anthems during a ceremony Thursday in Berlin, a day after she trembled in public for the third time in the last few weeks.
Merkel and visiting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sat for about four minutes while a German army honor guard played the national anthems of both countries outside the chancellor’s office. It is customary for the leaders to stand.
Concerns about Merkel’s health have increased in recent days after she appeared trembling while standing at three similar ceremonies in Berlin during the last few weeks.
On Wednesday, Merkel’s body shook as she stood at the same grounds outside her offices while she and Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne listened to the playing of their countries’ national anthems.
The first of the three public trembling episodes occurred June 18 when Merkel was standing alongside newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Days later she started trembling while standing during a speech by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the president’s offices in Berlin.
Merkel, who turns 65 next week, told journalists Thursday that she is taking care of her health.
“You can, first of all, rest assured that I’m aware of the responsibilities of my office and act accordingly as far as my own health is concerned,” Merkel said at a news conference alongside Frederiksen after the ceremony Thursday. “And, secondly, you can also rest assured that as a human being I’ve also got a considerable personal interest in being healthy and taking good care of my health.”
Merkel, who became Germany’s first female chancellor in 2005, was reelected to a fourth term that ends in 2021. She has said she will not seek another term.

Merkel and her spokesman have said the trembling June 18 was due to dehydration on a hot summer day and the second episode was a psychological reaction to the first one.
“I’m doing fine,” Merkel said Wednesday at another news conference with Rinne when pressed about her health. “I have been making progress and I have to live a while with this. But I’m fine and no one should be worried.”
Christoph Specht, a physician and medical correspondent for several German TV networks, said many people in Germany and across Europe are understandably worried about Merkel’s condition.
“We don’t know exactly what it is because there is no information coming out of her office on it and no medical bulletins are issued like there would be in the United States,” Specht said in an interview. “But that’s not the way it works in Germany. Merkel is not especially known as an extrovert in the first place and when it comes to her health she has every right to remain silent and people generally respect that.”
Several of Merkel’s predecessors were able to keep health issues out of the public spotlight. Helmut Schmidt, who served as West Germany’s chancellor from 1974 to 1982, had heart problems and was found unconscious in his office repeatedly, but journalists did not write about that until after he left office. Helmut Kohl, who ruled from 1982 to 1998, was able to keep secret from the public a painful prostrate swelling while fending off an attempt by party rivals to remove him from office in 1989.
Julius van de Laar, a political campaign consultant who has worked for several parties in Germany, said the days are gone when political leaders could conceal serious health issues.
“We’re not living in the ’60s or ’70s anymore and everything like this is going to be feeding the news cycles,” Van de Laar said in an interview. “It doesn’t matter where you get your news: The image of Merkel shaking is the image that’s going to be getting attention for a long time and it’s the image people are going to remember.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-angela-merkel-germany-berlin-20190627-story.html;2019-06-27;Germany’s Angela Merkel seen shaking again at Berlin event - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared unsteady and was seen shaking for the second time in just over a week at a ceremony in Berlin on Thursday.
Merkel, 64, folded her arms across her chest while her body trembled for around two minutes as she stood alongside President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at an indoor event where Germany’s new justice minister was being formally appointed.
The chancellor was handed a glass of water but rejected it. She appeared fine when she arrived at the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, half an hour later.
Merkel set off to Japan a few hours later for the annual summit of the Group of 20 global powers.
Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told news agency dpa that “everything is going ahead as planned. The chancellor is fine.”
Merkel’s office wouldn’t comment on the cause or otherwise elaborate. It is not publicly known if Merkel has any health problems. German privacy laws are very strict on that type of information.
On June 18, Merkel’s whole body shook as she stood outside in hot weather alongside Ukraine’s president. Merkel said afterward that she was fine after drinking three glasses of water, which she “apparently needed.”
Hot weather in Germany has continued this week, though temperatures in Berlin dropped significantly overnight after peaking at around 99 degrees on Wednesday.

Merkel has been Germany’s leader since 2005.
Last week, dpa reported that Merkel had previously been seen shaking under similar circumstances in the hot sun. It did not give a date for that incident, but said it was also ascribed to Merkel not drinking enough water.
The chancellor has a reputation for stamina garnered in years of late-night domestic and European negotiating marathons.
On Wednesday, she was on her feet in public for around two hours — first answering lawmakers’ questions in the Bundestag, then giving a speech across town. There was no sign then of any health issues.
Merkel has rarely had to cut back her work schedule significantly — though she did so for a few weeks in 2014 when she cracked her pelvis while cross-country skiing in Switzerland during a winter vacation.
Merkel said last year that she won’t seek a fifth term as chancellor and won’t seek any other political job after her term ends in 2021.
She gave up the leadership of her center-right party after a pair of poor state election performances that followed a rocky start to her fourth-term government. She has shown no signs since of wanting to give up the chancellorship before her term is up.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-political-turmoil-merkel-20190602-story.html;2019-06-02;Merkel faces political turmoil in Germany as Social Democrats’ leader steps down - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government was plunged into turmoil Sunday when the leader of the Social Democrats resigned abruptly under pressure after her center-left party suffered a humiliating defeat in last week’s European Parliament elections.
Andrea Nahles, the first woman to head Germany’s oldest party, announced she would quit as party chairwoman, parliamentary floor leader and even give up her seat in the German Parliament after her attempt to snuff out a brewing rebellion over the party’s frightening slide  backfired.
She had planned to ask her party members in Germany’s Parliament for a vote of confidence Tuesday, but it emerged over the weekend that she would most probably lose the vote.
“Talks within the parliamentary group and feedback from within the party itself have shown me that I no longer have the necessary support to carry out my duties,” Nahles said a terse statement. “I want to clear the path so that successors for both positions can be found in an orderly fashion. I hope you will all stick together and act prudently.”
Merkel, a leader of the conservative Christian Democrats who was elected to a fourth four-year term in 2017 with the reluctant support of Nahles’ Social Democrats, does not usually comment on internal party changes. But because the upheaval in her coalition partners, a party that stood up to the Nazis and traces its roots to 1863, is causing tremors that could bring down her government and put an early end to her career, the chancellor appeared before reporters on Sunday evening.
Merkel has already announced she would not seek a fifth term after her current term expires in 2021.
“I would like to express my respect for Andrea Nahles and her decision,” Merkel said. “Despite all that, I would like to take this opportunity to say that this government will continue its work with all earnestness and, above all, with a high degree of responsibility.”
She added there were burning issues on the table that need to be resolved within Germany and across Europe. “And in this spirit we will continue working on them.”

Merkel nevertheless now faces the specter of new elections well before the next scheduled balloting in 2021; many Social Democrats have been clamoring for the center-left party to regroup in the opposition after watching its support crumble as the underappreciated junior partner. Social Democratic parties have struggled in several leading European nations in recent years, especially France and Italy.
Merkel’s conservative party, with 246 seats in Parliament, does not have enough seats in the 709-seat Bundestag to rule on its own and has relied on the 152 seats held by the Social Democrats to form a majority with 398 seats in total. There are no other coalition alliances on the horizon, although Merkel, 64, could try to continue on with a minority government — even though pollsters say risk-averse Germans are opposed to such an unstable government.
“With Nahles out, it becomes more likely that the [Social Democrats] will leave Merkel’s grand coalition, potentially clearing the path for a new election,” said Julius van de Laar, an independent political analyst in Berlin.
“With all the international turbulence going on around her, Merkel was hoping for some stability at least in her own government,” he said. “Even though Merkel and Nahles didn’t see eye to eye on some issues, Merkel has had a reliable partner in Nahles. That will most certainly change, regardless of whomever the SPD selects as its new leader.”
Nahles, 48, took control of the party a year ago when it was still reeling from the shock of its historic poor showing of 20.5% of the vote in the 2017 elections. The rudderless Social Democrats fell even further in the May 26 European parliamentary elections to 15.8% — an especially bitter debacle because it represented a third-place finish in a nationwide election for the first time behind Merkel’s conservatives (28.9%) and the center-left Greens party (20.5%).
The Social Democrats have helped shape the country with a brand of socialism mixed with capitalism they call “social market economy.”
The party has elected three postwar chancellors: Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. But its hopes of leading another German government have faded in the last year.
The Forsa polling institute reported Sunday that the Greens had for the first time topped its weekly poll, with the conservatives second and Social Democrats third at 12%.
“The alliance between the conservatives and Social Democrats is now finished,” wrote Detlef Esslinger in a commentary for the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper’s online edition. “There was hardly any common ground to be found between the two parties and they were simply going through the motions. Does anyone seriously hope this will continue for another two years? Andrea lost her nerves in Germany and now the government that never really worked anyhow is about to fall apart.”

The agreement among Merkel’s conservative bloc hinges on other countries taking back migrants they’ve previously registered, as well as on the chancellor’s center-left coalition partners. Merkel said people would be kept in the new centers for 48 hours at most.
Merkel refused to close Germany’s borders as the migrant influx peaked in 2015 but has since significantly toughened her stance. She backed a wider but later-aborted proposal for border facilities over two years ago.
Asked by ARD television Wednesday whether she has now become a “sealing-off chancellor,” Merkel replied: “No. A clear no.”"
https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-immigration-20180703-story.html;2018-07-03;Pressure mounts as Germany's Merkel fine-tunes immigration compromise - Los Angeles Times;"The fallout was swift the morning after German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached an uneasy late-night immigration compromise with hard-line coalition allies, an agreement that appears to have saved her fragile government, at least for now.
To keep her government intact, Merkel was essentially forced to abandon the “Willkommenskultur,” or culture of welcoming, that she had preached in 2015, when she welcomed nearly 1 million migrants and refugees into Germany. With stricter border controls, transit camps and discretionary identification checks soon to be imposed on the nation’s southern border, the future of the freedom of movement, a core European principle, may now be at stake in the heart of the Schengen zone, a 26-nation area where border controls have been abolished.
Facing a potential insurrection from Horst Seehofer, her interior minister and leader of her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, Merkel agreed that migrants no longer will be able to enter Germany from Austria without any checks, that they will be processed in “transit centers” at the border and that an agreement would be made with Austria in the event that migrants ineligible for asylum are not accepted back by the European Union countries where they first arrived.
Early Tuesday, the Austrian government, headed by the right-wing, anti-migrant Sebastian Kurz, announced that it had no interest in becoming embroiled in German politics. In the event that Merkel’s compromise becomes law, “we will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people,” the government declared in a statement.
Merkel’s compromise still depends on approval from her other coalition partner, the Social Democrats, or SPD. Party representatives have said they have “many questions” about the notion of camps along the border. But they appear unlikely to reject the proposal out of hand and trigger a new round of elections, in which they would stand to lose.
Talks between Merkel, the CSU and SPD continued Tuesday evening.
In Vienna, Kurz’s government also said that if Germany approves this plan, Austria would have no choice but to respond with a version of its own, taking “measures to protect our southern borders in particular.” Controls between Germany and Austria, as well between Austria and Italy, where hundreds of thousands of migrants initially arrived, could trigger a domino effect inside an EU already on edge over the migrant question."

Trump is dragging us unwillingly into his personal wall of isolation, and Republicans are doing all they can to ensure that the great majority of Americans who resist are suffocated behind it. The wall is more than symbolic. It represents several generations of Republican stonewalling of change that would and should take us into the 21st century.
As Merkel suggested, the extremism Trump represents and that Republicans continue to affirm is leading us down a dark path that Germany took before.

To the editor: Don’t forget that the United States, despite its current “America first” posture, is still being the policeman of the world.
Countries like Germany, France, Great Britain and Sweden have extensive business relationships with China. They are subject to the same hacking, intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers as the United States.
The difference is that these countries lack the courage to confront China. Our pressure on Beijing to change its practices benefits these countries as well.

To the editor: McManus’ column was chilling. My fear, however, is not so much about “America alone.”
I see Trump trying to establish ties with autocrats like Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman. His admiration for tyrants along with his power as president make him a destructive force, both here and in the free world.
I would be less frightened by “America alone” than by an America in league with these countries.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-refugees-20190212-story.html;2019-02-12;Germany's conservative party shifts away from Chancellor Merkel's open-borders policy - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party publicly distanced itself from her landmark decision in 2015 to open the nation’s borders to more than 1.5 million refugees, saying it had drafted plans to tighten immigration rules.
The influx of largely unregistered refugees in 2015 and 2016, many of whom came from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and arrived by foot, was at first cheered by a number of Germans as an act of humanitarianism. It later caused deep rifts in Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party and across the European Union as some people became upset by the large number of refugees who poured into the region.
In a surprising move, Christian Democratic leader and Merkel’s handpicked successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the country had learned from mistakes and would shut down its borders if faced by another wave of newcomers. The influx a few years ago was a humanitarian exception, she said.
“The year 2015 was an extraordinary situation and we’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview with ARD television late Monday. “We’ve learned our lessons.”
Kramp-Karrenbauer said Germany would shut its borders “as a last resort” next time.
The conservatives, during a two-day party workshop in Berlin, drafted plans to tighten immigration rules, increase border security and make it easier to quickly deport asylum seekers whose applications are denied or who break the law.
Merkel, long a force for centrist stability in turbulent times, has steadfastly rebuffed calls since 2015 to reverse course on the refugees or apologize for the accompanying turmoil — tensions that also helped pave the way for Britain’s vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, a move known as Brexit. She turned over the reins of her party to Kramp-Karrenbauer in December after announcing in October she would not seek a fifth term when her fourth four-year term expires in 2021.
Merkel, who did not attend the party workshop, had warned late last year that the Christian Democratic Union, also known as the CDU, could lose a lot of voters after having dominated postwar German politics if it focused on 2015 and refugees. The conservatives have ruled the country for 30 of the last 37 years.

The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has capitalized on anger over refugees, winning seats in all 16 state parliaments and siphoning support from Merkel’s conservatives.
The anti-Merkel drift in the Christian Democrats is most likely related to elections later this year, according to political analysts: first the European Union parliamentary elections in May, then three regional elections in the fall in three eastern German states. In eastern Germany, opposition to Merkel’s open-door policies toward refugees is especially intense, and the AfD could overtake the conservatives as the No. 1 party in at least one state, Saxony.
“It’s the party’s moment of reckoning against Merkel,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “They’ve got to go down this route and concede mistakes were made because otherwise they’re not going to win back the right wing of the party. The conservatives are still terribly divided, and they’re scared to death they’re going to fall further in the elections coming up later this year.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-elected-20180314-story.html;2018-03-14;Angela Merkel elected for fourth term as German chancellor - Los Angeles Times;"Germany’s Parliament elected Angela Merkel for her fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday, putting an end to nearly six months of political drift in Europe’s biggest economy.
Lawmakers voted 364-315 to reelect Merkel, Germany’s leader since 2005, who ran unopposed. The coalition of Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union, its Bavaria-only sister party the Christian Social Union, and the center-left Social Democrats has 399 of the 709 seats in parliament.
Merkel will head a much-changed Cabinet, with the governing parties — which are traditional rivals — keen to send signals of renewal after a September election in which all lost significant ground. There are new faces in the most important posts: the finance, foreign, economy and interior ministries.
The same parties have governed for the past four years but putting together the new administration has been unprecedentedly hard work.
Wednesday’s parliamentary vote came 171 days after the election, nearly double the previous record. The Social Democrats initially planned to go into opposition after crashing to their worst result since World War II, but Germany’s president nudged them into a reluctant about-turn after Merkel’s talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November.
Merkel was able to take office only after two-thirds of the Social Democrats’ members approved in a ballot the coalition deal clinched last month. At least 35 coalition lawmakers didn’t support her Wednesday, though that was in line with results at the beginning of her two previous “grand coalitions” of Germany’s biggest parties.
She will have to hold together what is potentially her most fragile coalition yet in what is widely expected to be her last term, while also addressing challenges such as a potential Europe-U.S. trade war and seeking agreement with France and others on the future of a fractious European Union."
https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-conservatives-20181207-story.html;2018-12-07;Germany’s ruling party selects new chair to succeed Angela Merkel, who remains chancellor - Los Angeles Times;"Germany’s ruling party Friday elected a protege of Chancellor Angela Merkel as its new leader, pushing back strong challenges from rivals who apparently were considering ousting Merkel before her term ends in 2021.
The conservative Christian Democratic Union party, which Merkel led for 18 years, elected centrist Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as its new chair, placing her on track to become the country’s next chancellor.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, defeated a strong challenge from two archconservative rivals who wanted to steer the party to the right and possibly oust Merkel well before the end of her term. Kramp-Karrenbauer received 517 votes from the 999 party delegates gathered in Hamburg, while millionaire businessman and erstwhile Merkel nemesis Friedrich Merz, 63, got 482 votes.
Another candidate, Health Minister Jens Spahn, 38, was knocked out of the running in the first of two rounds of voting.
The competition to lead the party that has been the dominant force in post-World War II German governments marked a sharp break in tradition for the conservatives, who for decades had picked their leaders in closed-door meetings and then presented a single candidate to run uncontested at party congresses.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is better known in Germany by her initials AKK, is a former governor of the small western state of Saarland. She is often called the “mini-Merkel” for her similar centrist outlook on many issues. “This competition was good for our party and it has given us a boost,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said. “Thank you for your confidence in me.”
Merkel, 64, has been chancellor of Europe’s largest economy since 2005. Her decision in October not to seek another two-year term as chair of the Christian Democrats came after a string of state election defeats for her party. She had long ruled out giving up control of the party leadership because it could result in an erosion of power, dooming her chancellorship.
Merkel’s popularity in her party has fallen in the last three years, after her decision to allow more than 1.5 million refugees from Syria and other troubled countries into Germany. She delivered an emotional speech at the start of the party congress and received a 10-minute standing ovation.

Merkel urged conservatives to continue fighting for multilateralism in an era of “dwindling international cooperation” that is being replaced by “the principles of deal-making.”
Because the Christian Democrats have ruled the country for 49 of the last 69 years, winning leadership of the conservative party is tantamount to being anointed as its candidate for the next election.
“Her victory means short-term political stability in Germany,” Julius van der Laar, an independent political analyst, said of Kramp-Karrenbauer. “It’s more likely now that Merkel’s grand-coalition government will stay in power until 2021. Merz would have almost certainly tried to push Merkel aside in 2019 in order to position himself as the agent of change.”
Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, said Merz’s defeat was a setback to the powerful right wing of the conservative party that has for years been hoping to remove Merkel — mainly over anger that she pushed the party to the political center.
“In the end, the CDU delegates voted for continuity, pure and simple,” Jaeger said. “It remains to be seen if Kramp-Karrenbauer can reunite the party now. It’s going to be the big challenge.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-future-20181029-story.html;2018-10-29;Germany's Angela Merkel, 'the president of Europe,' says she won't seek reelection as chancellor - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe’s most powerful leader and a force for centrist stability in a turbulent time, said Monday she would relinquish control of her center-right party in December and not stand for another term as chancellor in 2021.
Facing prolonged criticism from within her party over her leadership and especially her 2015 decision to open the country’s borders to more than 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere, Merkel made the surprise announcement to leaders of her Christian Democratic Union at a party executive meeting in Berlin. The meeting followed twin drubbings her party suffered in state elections in Hesse on Sunday and in Bavaria two weeks before.
For the record:
4:00 p.m. Oct. 29, 2018An earlier version of this story said President Trump threw Starburst candies at Angela Merkel in July. Trump actually threw the candies in June.
“It is time for a new chapter,” she told a news conference. “I was not born as chancellor,” she added, a characteristically modest way of saying she would not cling to the office.
Merkel, 64, has been the most influential European leader since her predecessor Helmut Kohl was defeated in the 1998 general election after 16 years in office. She has struggled to guide the continent through a challenging period marked by a rise in terrorism, the massive refugee influx, the Eurozone financial crisis and the rise of far-right parties in a number of countries, including her own.
“She was one of the last stabilizing pillars of the EU,” said Julius van der Laar, a political consultant in Berlin, who added that she and French President Emmanuel Macron were the driving forces in the European Union. “Together with Macron, she was holding the whole thing together. Disruption in Germany means less, not more, stability for Europe.”
President Trump has sometimes called her “the president of Europe,” and tried in vain to cut one-on-one trade deals with her in the expectation that she could then impose them on the rest of the European Union.
“I’m sorry, Donald,” she reportedly told him. “That’s not how it works here.”

During a G-7 meeting in June, Trump reportedly grew frustrated with Merkel and threw Starburst candies at her, exclaiming, “Here, Angela, don’t say I never give you anything.”
The daughter of a pastor, Merkel got into politics only after the Berlin Wall fell as a deputy press spokeswoman to East Germany’s first and only democratically elected leader. She was catapulted to the leadership of the conservative party in 2000 when a band of more powerful men eager to lead Germany grossly underestimated her.
Having outfoxed her more experienced male rivals, Merkel has led the conservative party for the last 18 years and been chancellor for the last 13, and had previously resisted calls to give up the party leadership – a powerful position in Germany that is used to keep members in line and bestow favors on loyalists. She had insisted that the party leadership and chancellor positions were inseparable — tacitly fearful of becoming a lame duck without the clout to control the party as its chairwoman.
But the background grumblings from within her ranks over the last three years turned into more ominous rumblings with the election defeats in Bavaria and Hesse — two conservative bastions where the Christian Democrats have ruled for decades. Merkel’s decision to allow so many refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other troubled countries also helped fuel a populist far-right movement known as the Alternative for Germany party that has siphoned away precious support from the conservatives.
Merkel’s conservatives won just 27% of the vote in the Hesse election on Sunday — their worst performance since 1966 in the wealthy western state that includes the country’s financial capital of Frankfurt. They will likely retain power in a renewed coalition with the Greens, who received 20% of the vote. Two weeks ago, the conservatives attracted just 37% of the vote in Bavaria.
“The image that our government has presented is not acceptable,” Merkel said, referring to ugly infighting with a Bavarian sister party. She called the election defeats a watershed moment for the conservatives.
“The results are bitter,” she said.
The conservatives are holding an annual party convention in December in Hamburg, where Merkel was expected to be reelected to another two-year term. She took over the party leadership in 2000 when the Christian Democrats were in opposition and mired in a campaign financial scandal surrounding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. She led her party back into power in 2005.
Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University, said Merkel’s power has long been eroding and that the poor election results essentially forced her hand.
“She evidently saw no other option than giving up the chair in face of the poor election results and weak opinion poll numbers for her party,” he said.
“It looks like she is trying to control the process as well as she can but there is a danger for her because she always said she needed to have both office and party chair. This will hurt her credibility,” he added.
It did not take long for at least one other candidate, a former Merkel rival, to announce plans to run for the party leadership. Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary whip until ousted by Merkel, was planning to run for the position, according to the Bild newspaper.
Others likely to run include Merkel loyalist and deputy party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Health Minister Jens Spahn, a Merkel critic.

https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-angela-merkel-20181030-story.html;2018-10-30;Will Angela Merkel's departure leave liberal democracy leaderless in a growing authoritarian jungle? - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the de facto leader of the European Union and, in the wake of U.S. abdication, of Western liberalism. Her announced departure in 2021 throws the future of both enterprises into doubt.
It can be difficult for Americans to grasp the importance of the transatlantic alliance that for nearly three-quarters of a century has protected democracy, prosperity and peace here, in Europe and, intermittently, around the globe. American ambivalence and sometimes outright hostility toward this nation’s role in the world fueled the rise of Donald Trump, who as president heaped scorn on NATO and other institutions of international cooperation.
With Britain already planning its exit from Europe, Merkel was left with the task of keeping the continent’s liberal democracies together, shoring up its weaker economies, taking in Syrian war refugees (and in so doing, expressing long-standing Western humanitarian values) and, importantly, providing a counterweight and counterexample to a belligerent Russia and an increasingly influential China.
With Britain already planning its exit from Europe, Merkel was left with the task of keeping the continent’s liberal democracies together.
There came a point a year ago when Merkel, acknowledging that the U.S. under Trump had become an unreliable partner and an absent leader, declared that Europeans must take their destinies into their own hands. She would, in effect, grab the torch of liberty and economic liberalism that American presidents once carried but that Trump cast aside.
But she was not strong enough to lift it. Not without the U.S. as senior partner, not with the rise of right-wing populism and authoritarianism now on display in Hungary and Poland, and gaining ground in Italy, Austria and her own country. Thanks especially to the migrant crisis, Merkel lost the confidence of many of her German constituents, as shown by a series of disastrous election losses. Her brief time as leader of the free world is coming to an end.
Who will replace her? Liberalism’s remaining champions — French President Emmanuel Macron, for example — lack Merkel’s presence or her nation’s economic might. Meanwhile, Russia looms over Europe, and although it may be economically weak and possess a mere shadow of the military might of the old Soviet Union, it is apparently powerful enough to seduce the American president away from this nation’s erstwhile friends and fracture not just the Atlantic alliance but Europe itself.
That ought to matter to Americans. For centuries, Europe was defined by the deadly struggle among its nations for land, wealth and allegiance. The creation of the European Union — bringing together, among others, the bitter enemies France and Germany, along with Britain and smaller neighbors — demonstrated that political and economic liberty along the American model could deliver not just wealth but security. The U.S. has been both a sponsor of and a beneficiary of those blessings.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »
In his book “The Jungle Grows Back,” Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Robert Kagan asserts that freedom and prosperity have been the rule in the Western world for the last seven decades not because they are the inevitable fate of humankind, but because the U.S. has been willing to pay the ongoing maintenance costs — the never ending work of cutting back the relentlessly growing jungle of chaos, dictatorship and war. Germany, Europe, rich as they are, cannot pay those costs alone.
The jungle is growing back in places like Brazil, where voters in Sunday elected far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro. The new president worked with and has celebrated the military dictatorship that ruled the huge South American nation before democracy was restored there in the 1980s. Strains of nativism and authoritarianism are evident in the leaders of nations like the Philippines and Mexico. Many of these leaders and would-be leaders — such as France’s right-wing politician Marine Le Pen — are openly lauded by Trump.
Once giving up its leadership, the U.S. may find it is a hard thing to win back. Merkel has handled it as best she could during the period of American retrenchment. We can only hope that her European successor will do the same.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-merkel-bavaria-election-20181014-story.html;2018-10-14;In a crushing vote, Merkel's allies suffer massive losses in Bavaria - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s beleaguered and now-fragile “grand coalition” government was handed a stinging setback Sunday when her conservative party in Bavaria suffered its worst showing in 68 years in an important regional election that will likely increase tensions for her on the national level.
While the conservative Christian Social Union party in Bavaria that is aligned with Merkel and her Christian Democrats will still cling to power in the prosperous state bordering Austria and the Czech Republic, exit polls showed its support slumped to 37.3%. The once-dominant party that had won as much as 61% of the vote just 15 years ago will now be forced to find a junior coalition partner — a humiliating step for a party that once enjoyed such deep support.
“This was an earthquake in Bavaria, and it shows that the federal government is a lot more fragile than it appears to be on the outside,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University.
“They’re pretending that we’ve got a stable government. But it looks to me now like it could collapse any day. I’d say it’s 60%-40% that this grand coalition won’t last until the next election due in 2021.”
Merkel’s name was not on the ballot in Bavaria, but her pro-refugee policies certainly took center stage.
After an ugly election campaign tinged with xenophobic reaction to the 1.5 million refugees and migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa who arrived with Merkel’s blessings, her conservatives and her junior coalition partners in Berlin, the center-left Social Democrats, were in a state of shock over their steep falls.
The Social Democrats, who share power with Merkel’s conservatives at the national level, fell 11 points to 9.6% in Bavaria — their worst state election performance anywhere since World War II.
Two smaller opposition parties in Bavaria appeared to profit from the uproar over the refugees and the heated battles between Merkel and her Bavarian allies over the last six months, but for different reasons.

The far-right Alternative for Germany won 10.6% after an unabashed campaign aimed at the refugees who have poured into the country since 2015. Yet the pro-Europe Greens party that supports refugees and immigrants won 17.8% — double its share in the last election in Bavaria in 2013, further siphoning support from Merkel’s party.
Analysts and political leaders in Berlin believe the results in Bavaria could further exacerbate fissures in the already tenuous grand coalition and might lead to its collapse before the national elections in 2021.
There is another important state election in Hesse, home to the German financial capital of Frankfurt, in two weeks, and a drubbing there could lead to more serious turbulence in the Berlin government. Merkel hopes to be reelected as the leader of the conservatives at a party congress in December, but there are growing doubts about that now.
“There’s no doubt about it that the debates we’ve endured in recent months, especially the tone and the style of it, did not help us at all in Bavaria,” Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel’s deputy party leader, told reporters in Berlin.
Markus Soeder, Bavaria’s governor, is likely to stay in office if he can pick a small party to be his coalition partner. He made it clear he favors an alliance with the Free Voters party that is active only in Bavaria and won 11.5% of the vote, but he could enter a coalition with the Greens.
“This is painful for us,” Soeder told reporters in Munich after the results were announced. “We had to face a lot of challenges because of the tricky balancing act going on in the federal government. The important thing now is that we get a stable government for Bavaria.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-putin-20180818-story.html;2018-08-18;Putin dances at Austrian wedding before meeting with Merkel in Germany - Los Angeles Times;"Russian President Vladimir Putin made a flying visit to Austria to attend the wedding of the country’s foreign minister Saturday before heading to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Austrian authorities imposed tight security measures around the site of the ceremony near the southern border with Slovenia, where Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl married her partner Wolfgang Meilinger, a businessman. Kneissl, an independent, was nominated by the pro-Russia Austrian Freedom Party, whose leaders also attended the wedding.
Photos showed Putin dancing with the bride, who was dressed in a traditional Austrian costume. According to Austrian public broadcaster ORF, Putin also brought a small Cossack men’s choir along to entertain about 100 guests at the wedding.
Austrian lawmaker Joerg Leichtfried of the opposition Social Democratic Party criticized Kneissl’s decision to invite Putin to the wedding, saying it called into question Austria’s role as a neutral intermediary in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels are battling government forces. Austria currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency.
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that the Russian president spent about an hour at the wedding. Putin gave the newlyweds a cold press oil machine, a traditional Russian samovar and a landscape painting that “depicts the place where the groom hails from,” Peskov said.
Peskov said Putin also gave “quite a long toast in German in which he said he was thankful and happy that he got a chance to visit the hospitable Austria.”
Speaking hours later alongside Merkel before the two leaders held bilateral talks at the German government’s guesthouse in Meseberg, north of Berlin, Putin said they would discuss bilateral ties, economic cooperation and Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea.

The United States and some European countries have criticized the pipeline, saying it could increase Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, harm Ukraine — currently a major gas transit country — and pose an environmental risk.
Germany imported 53 billion cubic meters of Russian gas last year.
“Nord Steam 2 is purely an economic project and it doesn’t close the door to shipping gas through Ukraine,” Putin said. Transit fees for Russian gas are an important item contributing to the Ukrainian budget.
With protesters audible Saturday outside the guesthouse in Meseberg, Putin also raised the issue of humanitarian aid and funding for international reconstruction in Syria.
“It’s important to help those areas that the refugees can return to,” he said. “I think it’s in everyone’s interests, including Europe’s.”
Germany, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing the war, has in the past insisted it wouldn’t contribute to the reconstruction of Syria before a political settlement to end the war has been reached.
Merkel said the talks would also touch on the possibility of establishing a United Nations mission to help bring about peace in Ukraine."
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-qvortrup-angela-merkel-free-market-20170130-story.html;2017-01-30;Angela Merkel’s take on how to make a country great (again) - Los Angeles Times;"In 2013, German Chancellor Angela Merkel fractured her hip while skiing in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Doctors ordered her to rest. Feeling bored, she picked up “The Transformation of the World,” a 1,500-page tome by the German historian Jürgen Osterhammel. It argued that the most successful 19th century economies championed open markets and liberal immigration laws, and that these policies spurred technological advances. Merkel liked what she read; she felt it reflected her world view. She even invited the academic to give a lecture when she turned 60 later that year.
Merkel has been described as “the liberal West’s last defender” and the virtual antithesis to President Trump. And so she is in many ways. She promotes free trade; she espouses ethnic tolerance; she opposes isolationism. She is also a defender of women’s rights (she introduced Germany’s current abortion law) and an advocate of green policies. But often lost in the conversation is the fact that Merkel adheres to liberal and globalist principles because she thinks that’s best for Germany, not for abstract ideological reasons.
It was Merkel’s illiberal personal history that shaped her governing philosophy.
“I once lived behind a fence. That is something I do not wish to do again,” Merkel said at an EU summit when the Hungarian prime minister criticized Germany’s decision to accept refugees fleeing the Syrian crisis.
No nation can confine itself any more to considering only its own concerns; if it still does so, it will sooner or later inflict harm on itself.
— German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in 2014
Merkel grew up in East Germany, the land of exit visas, where travel was allowed only in exceptional circumstances. More than 100 people were shot and killed when they tried to flee the Stalinist state. As she has said in numerous interviews, Merkel empathizes with the Syrian refugees trying to escape from the no-less totalitarian Islamic State. But she also understands that they can contribute positively to German society, just as communist refugees contributed to Western European and American society.
“No nation can confine itself any more to considering only its own concerns; if it still does so, it will sooner or later inflict harm on itself,” Merkel said in 2014, another opinion substantiated by her past.
The Communist regime imposed punitive tariffs on products from non-communist countries to protect East German factories from competition. Simultaneously, these factories were guaranteed a market for their goods in the Soviet Union. In essence, the Soviet economy was based on the principle “buy Communist, hire Communist.” We all know how that went: Protectionism led to inefficiency, scarcity and inferior products.
To Merkel, it’s obvious that the best way to keep German factories humming is not to force German consumers to buy German, but to make quality products — and to advance policies that help foreign consumers become wealthy enough to buy them.

Hence Merkel’s approach to the European Union. She has endorsed providing economic aid to poorer countries, in part for their advantage, but also — why deny it? — to increase German exports.
Some have criticized Merkel for turning the EU — in Trump’s words — into “basically a vehicle for Germany.” It’s certainly the case that Germany has benefited from EU economic policies, but so too did America benefit from the Marshall Plan after World War II. Merkel, not surprisingly, is concerned about the economic fortunes of the country she leads; but in her universe, cross-border trade ultimately improves conditions everywhere.
Trump believes he can “Make America Great Again” by putting tariffs on imported goods and by shielding American industry. Merkel believes the opposite. She believes that you can make a country great only if its companies are allowed to — indeed, are forced to — prove their worth in open and healthy competition on the world markets.
It is strange indeed that the current great champion of free-market economics is a woman from a former communist country, and not a billionaire capitalist from America.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-trump-20180622-story.html;2018-06-22;Trump's bashing of Angela Merkel might help her keep a grip on power in Germany - Los Angeles Times;"President Trump appears to have it out for Angela Merkel.
Taking aim at the German chancellor’s decision to let in more than 1.4 million refugees — mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan — he tweeted this week that “the people of Germany are turning against their leadership,” adding, “Crime in Germany is way up.”
“Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!” he continued.
Merkel shot back that Trump was wrong: Crime in Germany fell 9.5% last year to reach its lowest level since 1992, and the share committed by foreigners was also down.
“The statistics there speak for themselves,” Merkel said at a news conference.
Refusing to back down, Trump tweeted: “Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report those crimes) since migrants were accepted.”
His attack was widely interpreted in Germany as an attempt to hurt Merkel politically at the most challenging moment in her 13 years in office. She is struggling to hold together a fragile 3-month-old, three-party coalition and has been weakened by the worsening tensions over her pro-refugee policies.
“Does Trump want to overthrow Merkel?” the bestselling Bild newspaper asked in a banner headline.
But if that’s his goal, his antagonism is likely to backfire, according to political analysts. They say that Trump is so despised in Germany, and his meddling in Germany’s domestic affairs so unwelcome, that he may be giving Merkel a much-needed political boost.

“It could well help Merkel in this situation that Trump has attacked her at home,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “Even though some people may say privately ‘Trump probably has a point,’ it’s outrageous behavior. What he’s saying sounds like what the far-right in Germany says. It doesn’t go down well with most people.”
Jaeger said he expects conservative members of Parliament will face increasing pressure to rally around Merkel because of Trump’s meddling.
A survey released last week by the Infratest Dimap institute found that 74% of Germans fear Trump is a threat to peace and global security.
“Being close to Trump is not seen as helpful to anyone in Europe — not even the populists,” said a senior European Union official who spoke on condition that he not be named.
The two leaders have long been at odds.
Merkel has rebuffed Trump’s attempts to cut direct deals with her on behalf of the entire EU. Trump has regularly criticized her for not fulfilling her government’s promise to increase its defense budget as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But now the relationship has reached a new low.
“It’s clear that something’s very wrong in the chemistry between Donald Trump and Angela Merkel,” Bild reported.
A photograph from the Group of 7 meeting in Canada this month showed Merkel appearing to lecture Trump, while he sat with his arms folded and a scowl on his face and other leaders looked on.
Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm, told CBS News on Thursday that at the end of that meeting Trump threw two Starburst candies at Merkel, telling her: “Here, Angela. Don’t say I never give you anything.”
Though Trump’s Twitter attacks may help Merkel politically, her position remains precarious.
The archconservative Christian Social Union, one of three parties in Merkel’s coalition government, has been trying to force a showdown by pressuring her government to start turning away migrants whose asylum applications are pending in other EU countries.
Merkel has refused. But she reluctantly agreed to a July 1 deadline to persuade other EU countries to accept reforms that would lead to fewer migrants and refugees reaching Germany.
Julius van der Laar, an international political strategist in Berlin, said Merkel’s resistance to tightening of refugee policies was making her grip on power look more fragile than ever.
“She’s been brilliant in the past at getting out of trouble, but you get the feeling this time it’s not going to go well for her,” he said. “But I don’t think Trump tweets are going to hurt her at all — on the contrary.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-migrants-20181206-story.html;2018-12-06;"German Chancellor Merkel set to give up party chair; refugee policy viewed by some as sore spot - Los Angeles Times";"Germany is showing signs of fatigue toward refugees after three years of a controversial open-borders policy by Chancellor Angela Merkel that drew more than 1.5 million people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other troubled nations.
The country took in more refugees during that period than the other 27 members of the European Union, the United States and Canada combined. It spends more than $30 billion per year for such services as state-financed apartments or shelters, healthcare and monthly cost-of-living allowances of up to $400 per person.
But the humanitarian approach by Merkel, arguably Europe’s most influential leader, put strains on Germany and resulted in tension with other members of the EU despite some signs of assimilation and entrepreneurship.
“What’s important is that Germany and other EU countries send signals that those who do not need asylum protection – in other words, a majority of those coming – should not even embark on these dangerous journeys because the chances of them being sent back home will be high,” said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative (ESI) in Berlin, a think tank.
Merkel, who announced in October under political pressure that she would relinquish control of her center-right party this week  and not stand for another term as chancellor in 2021, has remained unapologetic about her September 2015 decision despite its having become a political liability. It helped fuel a populist far-right movement known as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that has siphoned away support from conservatives.
Critics say the benefits for newcomers amount to an incentive to go to Germany, with the cost-of-living allowance alone exceeding the minimum wages paid in many countries. The payments attract people looking to leave their homelands without legitimate grounds for gaining asylum, critics say, and enough is enough.
Enthusiasm for helping desperate and displaced people fleeing fighting, poverty and other issues has cooled considerably -- even though millions of Germans continue to wholeheartedly support refugees.
The initial outpouring of support that is summed up in the term Willkommenskultur, or culture of welcoming refugees, has since been replaced by hangover-like worries among Germans. Some fear that their magnanimity is being exploited by people from countries where there is neither war nor political persecution – basic grounds for obtaining asylum.

Syrians almost always receive asylum because of the more than seven years of fighting and devastation in their homeland. Many migrants from elsewhere manage to stay after their asylum claims are rejected under a murky “tolerated” status — leaving them in a legal gray area that makes it difficult to find work.
Knaus said public support for refugees genuinely in need of protection likely would remain high as long as those whose applications were rejected could be repatriated quickly.
There is growing unease – and statistical evidence to back it – that roughly two-thirds of those arriving since 2015 came in pursuit of a better life with no real chance of asylum. The influx boosted the fortunes of ed Alternative for Germany.
“Migration is not a human right,” said Beatrix von Storch, a deputy parliamentary leader for the AfD, which has become the largest opposition party with unabashedly anti-Muslim policies. “No border, no nation. We want to preserve our country. We can’t allow everyone to come in.”
Tapping into that vein of anti-immigrant sentiment also found in other EU countries, the AfD won nearly 13% of the vote in the 2017 federal election. In a country that largely scorns far-right movements following the horrors of its Nazi past, support for the AfD has grown to 15%, according to recent opinion polls.
Germany has been unable to repatriate many of those seeking asylum from countries in northern and sub-Sahara Africa as well as Pakistan and some parts of Afghanistan after their claims were rejected. Repatriations are slowed or foiled because of bureaucratic red tape and an elaborate system that allows for appeals. About 20% of those rejected later win asylum in appeals courts.
That inability to deport those deemed not eligible for asylum combined with a handful of violent crimes by newcomers and many lesser crimes has heightened angst about the possibility of more migrants — and the chance that Germany’s national identity might be altered.
“It was to be expected that we’d be facing more problems like rising crime rates when large numbers of mostly young men come to Germany without any real chance of obtaining asylum,” said Harald Pickert, inspector general of the Bavarian state police force.
Bavarian police say they have responded to calls at refugee centers more than 20,000 times so far in 2018 -- to break up fights between different ethnic groups or investigate crimes ranging from assault to theft, drugs violations and rape. The total number of crimes involving refugees and migrants has tripled to 40,109 cases in Bavaria alone — just one of Germany’s 16 states — in 2017 from 13,203 in 2014.
Karl-Heinz Kamp, president of the Federal Academy for Security Policy and a high-ranking government advisor, said many Germans were overly optimistic about the skills refugees were bringing with them when they swept into the country in 2015.
The flood of new arrivals has weakened the ruling Christian Democrats and especially Merkel, who has become a lightning rod of criticism for her can-do exhortations at the outset supporting the influx.
It also exposed fissures between Germany and other EU countries far less enthusiastic or even openly hostile about accepting refugees. contributed to Britain’s 2016 decision to leave the bloc and to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic refusing to accept EU plans to redistribute refugees across member countries.
The issue remains tough for Merkel, who could be forced out of office as chancellor sooner than she expects after she steps down Friday as chair of the Christian Democrats, a post she has held for 18 years.
A new party chair could engineer a change that would force Merkel’s exit as chancellor before her term ends in 2021. The candidates to succeed her as party chair include two arch-conservatives, Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn, and Merkel’s pick, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
Many supporters of Merkel’s handling of the refugee and migrant crisis say the concerns by some in Germany have overshadowed the efforts’ success, as well as the fact that the number of new arrivals has fallen to fewer than 200,000 per year.
German companies large and small that had been struggling to fill vacancies have been delighted with the new arrivals. The federal labor office announced last month that a total of 306,574 asylum seekers had found jobs in Germany through mid-2018 -- a gain of 100,000 in the last year.
The Berlin Water Works utility has also been hiring a dozen refugees and migrants each year for their three-year training programs, officials said.
Some refugees have become successful entrepreneurs.
Yamn Molhem, a co-owner of a restaurant called Aldimashqi, said he started the business with two other refugees from Syria three years ago and they now employ 30 people — all Syrian refugees.
“We work as hard as we can,” Molhem said. “It’s going really well.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on his first full day on the job, said Friday in Brussels that it was “unlikely” Trump would remain in the accord after a self-imposed May 12 deadline, barring a “substantial fix” negotiated with European leaders.
Speaking on the margins of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit for foreign ministers in Brussels, Pompeo said that no decision has been made but that he was communicating Trump’s position to allies in Europe and the Middle East.
“Absent a substantial fix, absent overcoming the flaws of the deal, he is unlikely to stay in that deal,” said Pompeo, who next visits Saudi Arabia, Israel and Jordan.
In Washington, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Trump at the White House on Friday for a three-hour working session. Iran topped the agenda, along with Syria, trade and NATO.
European allies have warned that leaving the 2015 multinational Iran accord would have dangerous consequences and might encourage Tehran to resume its now-blocked nuclear program. U.S. and European diplomats have met several times to negotiate possible supplemental agreements to address Trump’s concerns.
Merkel and Trump clearly did not see eye to eye Friday on the wisdom of pulling out of the nuclear deal.
“I set out my position, and ... obviously, this agreement is anything but perfect,” Merkel said at a joint news conference. “It will not solve all the problems with Iran. It is one piece of the mosaic, one building block, if you like, on which we can build up this structure.

”We will now see what sort of decisions are made by [the] American partners,” she said, adding that the United States and Europe “ought to be in lockstep” on curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
Trump repeated his characterization of the Islamic Republic as a “murderous regime” that was the driving force behind militant groups across the Middle East. “We must ensure it doesn’t even get close to a nuclear weapon,” he said.
Trump would not say whether he had an alternative to the nuclear deal or whether he would use force to stop Tehran from resuming its nuclear program.
“I don’t talk about whether or not I’d use military force. That’s not appropriate to be talking about,” he said. “But, I can tell you this, they will not be doing nuclear weapons; that I can tell you, OK? They’re not going to be doing nuclear weapons. You can bank on it.”
Merkel met with Trump two days after French President Emmanuel Macron made a similar pitch during a state visit to Washington. The United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China signed the nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, and United Nations monitors have repeatedly found Iran in compliance with its terms.
Under the accord, Iran destroyed or dismantled the bulk of its nuclear infrastructure and shipped its nuclear fuel out of the country under strict monitoring. In exchange, a network of international economic sanctions were eased and seized property, including cash held in U.S. banks, was returned to Tehran.
Trump has said he will decide by May 12 whether to pull out of the accord and unilaterally reimpose U.S. sanctions on Tehran. It’s unclear how quickly he would apply sanctions, however, which could buy time for further negotiations.
Trump and other critics say the accord is deficient because it lets some of the nuclear restrictions on Iran expire over time. They also complain that the nuclear negotiations did not address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its support for militant groups elsewhere in the Middle East.
Merkel concurred that Iran has inserted itself in its neighbors’ crises with support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and for Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces against rebel fighters, some of them allied with the U.S.
But she noted Iran had permitted frequent inspections by U.N. monitors under the nuclear accord. The critics argue that the inspectors do not have access to Iranian military bases and facilities.
“We are of the opinion that the [accord] is a first step that has contributed to slowing down their activities,” Merkel said. “But we also think, from a German point of perspective, that this is not sufficient in order to see to it that Iran’s ambitions are curbed and are contained.”
Merkel and Trump also discussed NATO and tariffs he plans to impose on steel and aluminum producers, chief among them Germany.
He has repeatedly complained about members of the NATO military alliance that do not yet spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, as they agreed at a summit four years ago. Merkel indicated she and Trump did not come to terms on the tariffs question.
“We had an exchange of views,” she said. “The president will decide.”
The freewheeling Trump and the staid Merkel have had a decidedly tense relationship — months went by last year when they reportedly didn’t even speak by phone — but the chill appeared to ease somewhat Friday.
Trump appeared to acknowledge his lack of popularity in Europe but added his own twist.
“They may not like Donald Trump, but you have to understand,” he said, “that means I’m doing a good job.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-anti-semitism-20180418-story.html;2018-04-18;Merkel condemns attack on two men wearing Jewish skullcaps in Germany - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday sharply condemned a street assault in Berlin on two young men wearing Jewish skullcaps that has stoked the debate about anti-Semitism in the country.
In a surprising twist, however, the victim of the attack, who identified himself on Israeli television as Adam Armoush, later told German TV that he wasn’t Jewish, but an Israeli from an Arab family.
Armoush told Deutsche Welle Television that he wore the skullcap to make a point to a friend who said it was risky to do so in Germany.
“I was saying it’s really safe and I wanted to prove it, but it ended like that,” he said.
Regardless of Armoush’s intention, it comes at a time of increased fears of anti-Semitism and indications that attacks against Jews are on the rise.
A video of the attack Tuesday showing Armoush being whipped with a belt quickly went viral with people assuming that Armoush was Jewish.
Merkel called the attack in the city’s trendy Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood “a very horrible incident” and vowed the government would respond “with full force and resolve” against growing anti-Semitism in Germany.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that “Jews shall never again feel threatened here.”

“It’s our responsibility to protect Jewish life here,” he wrote in reference to the killing of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis in the Holocaust more than 70 years ago.
Berlin police said the two men with the skullcaps were 21 and 24 years old, but didn’t identify them.
The video doesn’t show the outbreak of the fight or how it started, but Armoush told Israeli Kan TV that he was leaving his Berlin home when the three people started cursing at them.
“They kept cursing us and my friend asked them to stop cursing,” Armoush told Israeli Kan TV in Hebrew. “They started to get angry and one of them ran to me and I knew it was important to film it because there would be no way to catch him by the time police arrived.”
Police said they are still looking for the attackers.
Two Jewish organizations posted the video, which showed a young man attacking Armoush while yelling “Yahudi!” or “Jew” in Arabic.
The head of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, Aiman Mazyek, demanded punishment for the perpetrators, tweeting that “it makes me angry to see such violence full of hatred.”
“There’s anti-Semitism among German citizens, unfortunately, and also anti-Semitism from the Arabic-speaking region and the government will do everything [against it],” Merkel told reporters.
Armoush didn’t respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press.
The RIAS group said Berlin saw 947 anti-Semitic incidents, including 18 attacks and 23 threats, last year.
Anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise across Germany. Several Jewish students have reported anti-Semitic bullying in schools in recent months and Israeli flags were burned during a recent protest in Berlin.
Last week, a rap band that included cynical references about the Nazis’ Auschwitz death camp in its lyrics won the country’s most important music prize — drawing strong criticism from other artists and government officials. Several past winners said they would return their awards.
German rappers Kollegah and Farid Bang won an Echo award for their new album, including a track that contains the line “my body more defined than Auschwitz inmates.”
Their record company, BMG, defended the rappers Wednesday, citing “artistic freedom.” The musicians themselves denied anti-Semitism, but apologized for any offense caused.
In a separate incident, German aid group GIZ said Wednesday that it has taken action against several employees accused of posting anti-Semitic material on social media. The group, whose biggest client is the German government, said it fired one employee, issued a written warning to another and reprimanded a third.
GIZ said last month it was alerted by reports in Israeli media to the posts by staff working in Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories. One featured Israel’s flag with a Nazi swastika beneath the words: “I hate Israel.”
Tanja Goenner, chair of GIZ’s management board, said the group had “no reason to assume that anti-Semitism is a general problem.”
Earlier this month, Germany appointed a diplomat to coordinate government activities against anti-Semitism.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-coalition-20180304-story.html;2018-03-04;Germany's Merkel walks away a winner after vote that could have ended her career - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel proved to be a lucky duck instead of a lame duck on Sunday when the country’s second-largest political party, the Social Democrats, agreed reluctantly and after nearly six months of bitter wrangling to join forces with her conservative Christian Democrats for another four years.
Grass-roots members of the center-left Social Democrats opted by a surprisingly large two-thirds majority in a postal vote to swallow their pride and join another loveless right-left “grand coalition” with the Christian Democrats. The vote will keep Merkel in power even though Social Democratic leaders had vowed that they would do no such thing after an inconclusive election in September.
In that vote, both parties slumped to their worst post-World War II results after ruling four years together as a new far-right party, Alternative for Germany, siphoned away considerable support from both. Feeding off frustration over the arrival of more than a million refugees from Syria and elsewhere, it become the third-largest bloc in the six-party Parliament.
Weaker at home than any other time during her 12 years at the helm of Europe’s leading nation, the 63-year-old Merkel could have been forced out of power and Germany plunged into a political crisis with new elections likely if the 463,000 grass-roots members had voted against the coalition agreement. It was a detailed 179-page pact that the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats had hammered out a month ago in which Merkel turned over considerable power and important ministries to the Social Democrats to attract them into her government.
Germany has been politically adrift during the last five months without a new government. Many in the European Union had been holding their collective breath for the last four weeks as Social Democratic leaders begged party members to jump over their shadows and support another “grand coalition,” despite initial misgivings.
The nation’s two largest parties have been archrivals for most of the last 70 years. Many analysts and even Social Democratic leaders had expected an extremely close contest and were surprised that such a comfortable 66% majority of the party’s ballots were in favor of the coalition. Results were announced at a news conference televised live on four German TV networks early Sunday.
“Just about everyone was expecting it to be very close,” said Julius van der Laar, an international political strategist based in Berlin. “A lot in the [Social Democratic Party] thought it was just the wrong decision to be part of another Merkel government but others thought it was just time to get a working government. The big winner today is Merkel. She would have been in deep trouble with a ‘no’ vote. But she’s safe in the saddle now. She’s mastered yet another crisis.”

Merkel, whose first efforts to form a three-way coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats had failed in November, welcomed the Social Democrats’ vote — a clear reprieve for the veteran chancellor who is the European Union’s longest-serving leader. It was also applauded by heads of government across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron called it “good news for Europe,” a sentiment echoed by EU leaders in Brussels.
Merkel was also under pressure in her party after the disappointing election result in September and for making so many concessions to the Social Democrats in the coalition talks. If the Social Democrats had vetoed the deal, analysts believe Merkel would have faced fresh calls to resign.
Even though Merkel is loath to comment on the inner workings of the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, and rarely releases any information via Twitter, the chancellor applauded the move with a posting [link in German] on the Christian Democrats’ official Twitter account: “I congratulate the SPD on this clear result and I’m looking forward to continuing our good work together for the good of the country.”
Merkel and her new government are expected to be sworn into office by March 14.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-successor-20180219-story.html;2018-02-19;Germany's Merkel sets the stage for her eventual exit by picking a successor - Los Angeles Times;"Two decades after promising to quit politics before turning into a “half-dead wreck,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel began paving the way for her exit from office by picking the popular governor of a small state on the French border as her successor in a surprise move on Monday.
In what had all the hallmarks of a classic Merkel attempt to thwart a rebellion in her conservative party’s right wing, the 63-year-old leader, elected five months ago to a fourth four-year term, caught her rivals off guard by picking Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as deputy party leader — in effect, the crown princess.
Merkel did not, however, say when she might step aside.
The governor of Saarland, the 55-year-old Kramp-Karrenbauer has conservative views on social issues and a track record of electoral victories that should quiet Merkel’s many naysayers. Right-wing critics of the chancellor, who has been in power since 2005, are upset about her pushing the conservative party to the center as well as her contentious 2015 decision to allow more than a million refugees from Syria and elsewhere into Germany. Merkel’s popularity has plunged since elections in September, and a growing chorus of party leaders has called for her to step aside.
It was, political analysts said, a clever move by Merkel to name Kramp-Karrenbauer as the party’s deputy leader, or general secretary. It was the first time since Merkel took office in 2005 that she had designated a successor, and it was seen as heading off critics who were calling for a conservative voice to take the deputy leader post.
Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) crashed to their worst postwar result in the Sept. 24 election as a new far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party siphoned away millions of conservative voters tired of Merkel. Her powers abroad may be at their zenith, but at home she has probably never been more vulnerable.
“The party is fortunate that she’s eager to come to Berlin to help hold the CDU together and help create a stronger feeling of belonging,” Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin. The chancellor was the party’s general secretary herself from 1998 until she became its leader in 2000.
Merkel, who is the de facto leader of the European Union as head of its strongest economy, in part owes her re-election last year to Kramp-Karrenbauer. The Saarland governor, who has ruled for the last seven years, won re-election with unexpected ease in her tiny state, with a population of just 1 million, after a spirited campaign in early 2017. That may have paved the way for conservative victories in three other states and Merkel’s victory in September.

“This is one of the most difficult periods in Germany’s history,” said Kramp-Karrenbauer, standing next to Merkel. She was presumably referring both to the rise of the far-right AfD, which is now the largest opposition party in parliament, and to the bitter divisions in the country over the large number of refugees. “We need strong political parties. In difficult times like these, you can’t just go out there and blame others and say, ‘Someone else should do a better job.’ I think in times like these you have to be willing to take on responsibility yourself.”
Sometimes referred to in Germany by her initials “AKK” because of her difficult double name and her high levels of energy that remind some of the “AKW” abbreviation for nuclear power plants, Kramp-Karrenbauer comes from the center of the CDU and supported Merkel’s decisions during the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. Yet her membership in the Roman Catholic Church and family — she is the mother of three -- make her an appealing choice for many conservatives in the party, as does her opposition to full adoption rights for same-sex couples.

A devout AC/DC fan, she is married to a former mining engineer who quit his job to raise their children. Asked at the Berlin news conference whether she regarded herself as the new crown princess of the party, she replied, “I was never suited for princess roles.”
Many on the right have long been wary of Merkel, a divorced woman with no children, whose policies have pushed the Christian Democrats to the left and away from traditional conservative values.
“Merkel has made an extremely smart move with Kramp-Karrenbauer,” said Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at Goettingen University, in an interview. “She’s always been loyal to Merkel yet brings more traditional conservative viewpoints and her religion with her. This should quiet down the rebellion before it gets going any further.”
Yet the ascent of Kramp-Karrenbauer from the tranquillity of Germany’s provinces into the center of politics will likely also fuel speculation about when Merkel will ultimately step down – perhaps in two years, which would be halfway through the next legislative period. She had once hinted that she wanted to avoid the mistake made by two earlier Christian Democrat chancellors – Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl – who were forced out after holding on too long (16 and 14 years, respectively) in the false belief they were irreplaceable. Merkel witnessed Kohl’s withering election defeat in 1998 firsthand as his environment minister.
“I don’t want to be a half-dead wreck when I get out of politics,” she said at age 44 in 1998, right after watching Kohl’s humiliating defeat at the age of 68.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-german-coalition-20180207-story.html;2018-02-07;Germany moves toward a new coalition government after major concessions by Angela Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday made major concessions to a junior political party, including giving up control of key ministries, to reach an agreement for a proposed new coalition government that would end months of uncertainty.
The agreement, coming nearly five months after the Sept. 24 election put Merkel on track for a fourth term as chancellor, calls for the center-left Social Democratic Party to hold the vice chancellorship and several Cabinet posts, including the coveted finance and foreign berths.
The deal is subject to a postal vote by 460,000 registered members of the Social Democratic Party — many of them with a deep aversion to Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union party. The results are expected by March 4.
Merkel, whose party won the largest share of votes in September but fell far short of a majority in Parliament, appeared willing to give the Social Democrats almost everything the party demanded to end the longest period of political limbo in the country’s postwar history. Germany boasts Europe’s biggest economy.
Merkel said at a news conference that negotiating the conditions for the coalition government was a long but worthwhile journey.
“We’ve got a basis for a good and stable government, which our country needs and that many around the world expect from us,” said Merkel, who has been chancellor for 12 years.
The Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats have been the nation’s dominant parties since the late 1940s.
The left wing of the Social Democrats and its powerful youth organization, the Jusos, however, have been campaigning hard against another “grand coalition” as junior partners to Merkel after the party posted its worst postwar result: 20% of the vote in the September election.

Merkel’s conservatives were also battered in the election, falling to 33% of the vote in part because of voter frustration over her 2015 decision to open the country’s borders for more than a million refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and other troubled spots.
Merkel gave the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, much of what it wanted probably because she feared grass-roots members would vote against a deal and and plunge Germany into a prolonged period of uncertainty with new elections, political leaders and analysts said.
“You can see the SPD’s signature quite clearly in this agreement,” said party Chairman Martin Schulz, who will become the country’s next foreign minister if the deal is approved.
Schulz said the 177-page agreement includes plans to increase spending on schools, housing, pensioners and job market reforms that party members like to see.
Germany has been running budget surpluses since 2012 and is expected to post a $35-billion surplus in 2018. But rather than cut taxes, the agreement indicates the government would increase spending by about $60 billion over the next four years — much of that on projects the Social Democrats favor.
The unusual turmoil in Germany after decades of political stability in a three- or four-party Parliament was caused at least in part by the rise of the upstart far-right Alternative for Germany party, which won 92 seats in the 709-seat Parliament in September’s election.
Alternative for Germany showed surprising strength, and its campaign aimed against foreigners and refugees made it difficult for the other parties to form a majority. Merkel ruled out a minority government, in part because of lingering fears over political instability in the 1930s that led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.
The Social Democrats initially wanted to spend the next four years in opposition after spending the last four years as Merkel’s junior partner. but the party agreed to explore another four-year coalition after she unexpectedly failed in November to persuade the Greens and Free Democrats to join forces with her.
The deal would give Social Democrats control of seven Cabinet posts. The new finance minister would be expected to push the government into taking more pro-European Union positions that France, Italy, Spain and Greece have long been demanding, and could get Germany to relax some of its hard-line positions against struggling EU countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and France, analysts said.
“Merkel’s main goal, clearly, was holding on to power and the chancellery,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, who expects Germany to be more open to giving greater financial support for Eurozone countries struggling with high deficits.
“She was willing to pay any price to put this government together,” Jaeger said. “She had to make it happen now because if it came to new elections, it would have become quite difficult for her to continue as party leader.”

https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-21/russia-ukraine-germany-nato-nordstream;2022-04-21;Op-Ed: What will it take for Germany, Europe's heavyweight, to stand up to Russia? - Los Angeles Times;"As the savage war in Ukraine continues, the world expects Germany, Europe’s largest economy and a political heavyweight, to play a central role in the fight to isolate and stop Russia. But how serious is Germany about supporting Ukraine?
On Feb. 27, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a “historic change.” In a widely supported speech, Scholz reversed Germany’s foreign policy. Abandoning its stance of not sending weapons to crisis regions, Germany would now ship armaments to Ukraine to defend against Russia, Scholz said. Germany would boost its military spending, which Scholz’s party, the Social Democrats, campaigned against as recently as last fall. It would target Russia economically, supporting sanctions and potentially even denying Russia access to the SWIFT banking system. Scholz froze the completion of the controversial Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia, which would have ensured Germany’s energy dependence on Russia.

Opinion
Urban warfare is the hardest type of battle. Russian forces aren’t prepared for the next phase of the fight into Ukraine’s metropolitan centers.

These moves were a 180-degree shift from Germany’s long-standing policy of “Wandel durch Handel,” or change through trade — the idea that Russia would be engaged most effectively through trade and economic integration. What neighboring countries and foreign critics saw as risky reliance on Russia, a series of German governments viewed as establishing better relations with an important regional power.
Yet almost two months after Scholz’s historic announcement, not much has happened on any of these fronts. Despite criticism from international observers and its own ministers, the German government has slow-walked its support for Ukraine.
Military aid has yet to be delivered. Estonia and the Czech Republic, far smaller countries than Germany, have donated more weaponry and arms to Ukraine than Germany has since the war began. No heavy weapons such as tanks, artillery or advanced air defense systems have been delivered at all.
Ukraine has offered to buy 100 German tanks, but Germany has balked, arguing that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has to reach a joint decision among its  members on the deal first. Even as the new Russian offensive in the Donbas region has begun, with indiscriminate shelling of population centers, the German government has not budged. Instead, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced that supplying Ukraine with further arms would undermine Germany’s defense capabilities.
Last week, Scholz announced Germany would provide $1 billion to Ukraine. That is likely to get parliamentary approval, but a decision has been delayed until June. Meanwhile, Russia receives $1 billion a day  from Germany and other European countries from sales of its oil and gas. Germany is more dependent on Russian gas and oil than the rest of Europe, so cutting off its dependence would be a powerful signal of credible commitment to Ukraine. What’s more, it won’t necessarily have dire economic consequences for Germany.

Polls show that the German public supports sending both military and financial aid to Ukraine, with the majority supporting Scholz’s turnabout in policy. Although Germans are worried about cutting off the Russian energy supplies, their support for Ukraine is widespread.
So what’s stopping Germany? The inertia on economic and military aid cannot be explained by lack of popular support, potential damage to the German economy or even government coalition politics. Nor is it a question of German guilt over its Nazi legacy.
Instead, the failure to act exemplifies a persistent attitude among the German political establishment  that there could be “no peace in Europe without Russia.”
In practice, this has meant prioritizing Russian interests. For decades, German elites dismissed the security interests of smaller countries around them, much as Russian President Vladimir Putin has.

Family and attorneys recall the difficulty of finding and communicating with people in immigration custody.

In the shared view of many Russian and German leaders, places such as Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states are simply “the lands between” — upstart countries whose interests are not to be taken as seriously. Germany ignored their warnings about Putin and dismissed their opposition to Nord Stream 2. Ukraine now poses a difficult quandary: It is hard to justify a partnership with Russia when it is hell-bent on invading and eliminating Ukrainian sovereignty and national identity.
The ties between the German and Russian political elites reinforce this deference to Russia. Perhaps most notoriously, Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, quickly gained a seat on the board of the Russian energy company Rosneft after leaving office and then energetically lobbied for Russian interests. Just weeks before the Russian invasion, Schröder was nominated to join the board of Gazprom, the Russian state company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
Other politicians have defended what they see as joint German and Russian interests. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, defended Nord Stream 2 last year as “one of the last bridges between Russia and Europe” and, despite Russian aggression, argued that “we must not lose sight of the bigger picture.” Sigmar Gabriel, the former Social Democratic leader and energy minister, called for the “federalization of Ukraine” after the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea, widely understood to mean a permanent Russian role in Ukraine. Even Scholz, the current chancellor, previously sought friendly ties with Russia,  while ignoring Putin’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and the aggression against Ukraine in 2014.  For many German elites, appeasing Russia neatly  dovetails with what they see as Germany’s economic interests: not just energy, but the billions sunk by Russian oligarchs into German real estate and industries.
In this mindset, addressing Ukraine’s survival without first considering Russian interests is nearly impossible. After all, Scholz’s predecessor, chancellor Angela Merkel, also “kept in mind what was tolerable for Russia,”  as one of her top foreign policy advisors put it.
Germany is the political and economic leader of the European Union. Yet, time and again, it has deferred and submitted to Russia’s autocratic government. If the horrific invasion of a sovereign European country cannot change the minds of the politicians in Berlin, Germany is not only failing its moral obligations but also cementing its government’s reputation as being beholden to Putin.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-elections-20160904-snap-story.html;2016-09-04;Nationalists overtake Merkel's party in a German state legislature vote - Los Angeles Times;"A nationalist, anti-immigration party performed strongly in a German state election Sunday in the region where Chancellor Angela Merkel has her political base, overtaking her conservative party to take second place amid discontent with the leader’s migrant policies, projections indicated Sunday.
The three-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won about 21% of votes in the election for the state legislature in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, according to projections for ARD and ZDF television based on exit polls and partial counting. They put support for Merkel’s Christian Democrats at between 19% and 20%, which would be their worst result yet in the state.
The center-left Social Democrats, who lead the outgoing state government, were expected to be the strongest party with about 30% support.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, an economically weak region in Germany’s northeastern corner, is home to 1.6 million of the country’s 80 million people and is a relative political lightweight. It is, however, the state where Merkel has her parliamentary constituency, and Sunday’s vote was the first of five regional votes before a national election just over a year away.
National AfD leader Frauke Petry celebrated “a blow to Angela Merkel.” Local AfD leader Leif-Erik Holm told supporters: “Perhaps this is the beginning of the end of Angela Merkel’s chancellorship today.”
Merkel’s refugee policies were a prominent issue in the campaign for Sunday’s election, which came a year to the day after she decided to let in migrants from Hungary — setting off the peak of last year’s influx. Germany registered more than 1 million people as asylum seekers last year.
New arrivals in Germany have slowed drastically this year, and Mecklenburg is home to relatively few foreigners. Still, New Year’s Eve robberies and sexual assaults blamed largely on foreigners, as well as two attacks in July carried out by asylum seekers and claimed by Islamic State, have fed tensions.
Merkel has stuck to her insistence that “we will manage” the refugee crisis and has also said that “sometimes you have to endure such controversies.”

“This result, and the strong performance of AfD, is bitter for many, for everyone in our party,” Peter Tauber, the general secretary of Merkel’s Christian Democrats, said in Berlin.
He said that the state government’s positive record had taken a back seat for many voters, “because among a recognizable part, there was an explicit wish to voice displeasure and protest, and we saw that particularly strongly in the discussion about refugees.”
Mecklenburg was the only one of Germany’s 16 states where the far-right National Democratic Party was represented in a state legislature, but it appeared to have lost its seats on Sunday. Projections put its support below the 5% needed to keep them, with many supporters apparently switching to AfD.
The state has been run for the last decade by the parties that currently run Germany. Popular Social Democratic Gov. Erwin Sellering has governed with Merkel’s party as his junior partner. Both parties lost support compared with the last state election five years ago, when they polled 35.6% and 23%, respectively.
The opposition Left Party — once popular with protest voters — also lost support, slipping about six points to 12.5%. The left-leaning Greens were hovering around the 5% mark.
AfD is now represented in nine of Germany’s 16 state legislatures and hopes to enter the national Parliament next year. Still, it fell well short Sunday of its aim of becoming the strongest party in Mecklenburg, and also didn’t match the 24.3% support it won in another eastern state, Saxony-Anhalt, in March.
There’s no realistic prospect at present of AfD going into government, and other parties won’t deal with it."
https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-election-20170924-story.html;2017-09-24;Merkel wins another term in Germany, but she has a newly empowered far-right foe - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared victory Sunday as her conservative party clung to its place as the country’s largest political force, but the stunning rise of a far-right, anti-immigrant party cast a pall over her reelection to a fourth term.
Signaling a turbulent era ahead for Europe’s largest economy, hundreds of protesters shouting “Out with the Nazis” spontaneously gathered in the rain outside the Alternative for Germany party celebrations in central Berlin after the nationalist party won a remarkable 12.3% of the vote by campaigning against refugees, foreigners and Islam.
Breaking taboos and using language not heard in Germany since the Nazi era, the populist opposition party vowed to make life difficult for Merkel.
“We’re going to take back our country.… We’re going to be hunting Merkel wherever she goes,” said one of the party’s leaders, Alexander Gauland, who recently stirred controversy by saying Germans should take pride in what their soldiers achieved in World War I and World War II.
Alternative for Germany was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro currency party but turned sharply to the right. Much like the Republican Party under President Trump, it won support from voters struggling to make ends meet in one of Europe’s richest countries and frustrated with mainstream parties that, they felt, ignored their concerns. It campaigned on demands that Germany close its borders to foreigners immediately, raise the number of deportations of asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected, and deny refugees from bringing their families to Germany.
There’s no point beating around the bush. We were hoping for a better result.
— German Chancellor Angela Merkel
Merkel seemed chastened but relieved to be able to hold power for another four-year term a year after political shocks surprised elsewhere — such as Britain’s decision to leave the European Union and Trump’s election. She has become Europe’s most important leader and a regular critic of some of Trump’s policies on international issues such as climate change.

“There’s no point beating around the bush,” Merkel said in a speech at her election headquarters in Berlin. “We were hoping for a better result, obviously, but I’m happy we achieved our goals. We’re the strongest party, and we got a mandate to form the next government. And that’s what we’re going to do.”
In power since 2005, Merkel was initially hesitant to run for a fourth term but ultimately decided she had a duty to help resolve the country’s migrant crisis, according to allies and journalists who have spoken to her in off-the-record briefings.
This was the first general election since she opened the borders in 2015 to more than 1 million refugees from Syria and other trouble spots, and anger over the 63-year-old leader’s decision boiled over and sent Alternative for Germany soaring over the 5% hurdle needed to win seats in Parliament and into a highly visible position as the third-largest party in the six-party Parliament.
With nearly 90% of voting districts reporting, Merkel’s Christian Democrats led with 33.9%, down sharply from 41.5% in the last election in 2013. Her junior coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, came in second at 20.8%.
“The results are very depressing,” said Volker Kauder, Merkel’s whip in Parliament. “We’ll have to analyze what went wrong.”
The Social Democrats immediately ruled out a resumption of the “grand coalition” that was in power for the last four years under Merkel’s leadership. That would force Merkel to try to form an awkward three-way coalition with two smaller parties. Merkel and leaders of the four other parties have all ruled out any coalition with Alternative for Germany, which will have 88 members in the 631-seat Bundestag.
The pro-business Free Democrats were Merkel’s junior allies from 2005 to 2009 and won 10.9% on Sunday. That center-right coalition would need help from a third party, the pro-ecology Greens, who won 8.9%, for what Germans call a “Jamaica coalition” because the banner colors of those three parties — black, yellow and green — are those of Jamaica’s national flag.
Under Germany’s complicated proportional representation election system and protracted coalition talks after the vote, it could take many weeks or even months for Merkel to form a government with the two new junior partners — both itching to return to power but archenemies for decades. The ruling grand coalition will stay in power in a caretaker role until that happens.
The rise of Alternative for Germany mirrors gains by populist parties across Europe. In France, far-right leader Marine Le Pen won 34% of the vote in May and right-winger Geert Wilders won 13% in the Netherlands in March.
The German nationalist party, known by the initials AfD, won more than 6 million votes and was believed to have siphoned away more than a million ballots from Merkel’s conservatives. It also attracted about 1.5 million Germans who did not vote four years ago. Voter turnout was high, at over 75%.
“This is a watershed moment in Germany and the end of an era for the two major parties,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, after the two leading parties that have dominated Germany since World War II — the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats — were reduced to only about half of the electorate.
“I see Merkel coming under increasing pressure within her own party because a lot of people in the conservative party are going to lose their jobs,” Jaeger said.
The emergence of a powerful far-right party in Germany is an ominous development for millions of Germans who have spent generations coming to terms with their country’s Nazi past, as well as for millions of others across Europe who harbor fears of a resurgent far-right.
“There’s no place in Germany for a party like the AfD — that goes without saying,” said Andreas Tebharth, a 55-year-old construction engineer who had just voted on Sunday, a rainy day in Berlin.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-post-election-20170925-story.html;2017-09-25;Angela Merkel is still the most powerful leader in Europe, but she's been weakened at home - Los Angeles Times;"Having won reelection to a fourth term leading Germany, Angela Merkel has probably reached the pinnacle of her powers abroad as Europe’s most important leader.
But, ironically, Sunday’s general election victory has left Merkel weaker than ever at home — blindsided by the rise of a nationalist far-right party whose success at the polls has badly shaken her proud conservative party.
Europe and the world may be looking increasingly to the imperturbable 63-year-old Merkel for leadership, especially now that British Prime Minister Theresa May is busy separating her country from the European Union, France’s Emmanuel Macron is tied up with domestic battles and President Trump is shifting the United States to an “America first” policy.
Merkel, in power since 2005, will nevertheless be forced to look over her shoulder in Germany to keep a watch over her own restless conservative party allies. In theory, they are her political friends. But analysts believe nervous rivals within her Christian Democratic Union party will first try to force her back to the right, especially on her refugee policy, and ultimately try to force her out of power because of the party’s serious erosion of support.
“Merkel’s standing on the international stage has most definitely been enhanced with her reelection in such a difficult and turbulent time for the outside world,” said Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at the University of Goettingen. “A lot of countries will be looking to Merkel as an anchor of stability and for a strong EU. But at home it’s going to be a different story.”
Merkel and her predecessors have shown a tendency to avoid assuming any international leadership role, partly because of the country’s notorious past. In addition, she has seen her authority grow over the last 12 years by virtue of her longevity and Germany’s growing economic clout. Her unflappable style and reputation as a steady pair of hands in tight spots have also helped cement her global standing.
“The whole world might be turning to Merkel for leadership but Sunday’s election could ultimately end up being a Pyrrhic victory,” said Hasche, who predicts a stormy era ahead for Merkel after her Christian Democrats plunged from 42% support in 2013 to 33% Sunday — the party’s worst showing since 1949.

The center-right conservatives, who have dominated postwar politics, lost more than a million voters to the upstart Alternative for Germany party. The anti-immigrant, anti-Islam party won 12.6% of the vote Sunday by campaigning hard against the 1 million refugees who poured into the country in 2015 after Merkel opened the floodgates to refugees and migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere.
The Christian Democrats also lost their aura of invincibility, a disconcerting development for countless thousands of party soldiers across the country who hold elected office. Their careers are suddenly looking vulnerable as a result of what some consider to have been a reckless decision to allow in so many refugees from Syria, Iraq and other trouble spots.
“She’s a lot weaker today at home than she was,” added Hasche. “The party’s arch-conservatives in Bavaria aren’t going to accept any more compromises when it comes to refugees and asylum.”
Merkel lost her junior coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, who immediately announced they would not renew their alliance after falling to an all-time low of support. She will now have to try to form a new and awkward three-party alliance known as a “Jamaica coalition” with the pro-business Free Democrats and the leftist Greens. The three parties have the same banner colors as the Jamaican flag: black, yellow and green. Negotiations are expected to last until December, analysts said.
“I don’t think the major power dynamics will change, in the sense that Merkel will continue as chancellor,” said Julius van de Laar, an international political strategist based in Berlin. “But I do think that German politics will likely become significantly more unstable because of this result.”
Their loss of votes from 2013 to 2017 will cost the conservatives 65 seats in Parliament, giving them a total of 246. The Alternative for Germany party won 94 seats. Fears are running high in Merkel’s party that it will sustain further losses in coming state and city elections because of anger over the chancellor’s immigration policies. That, analysts say, means she could be on borrowed time.
“The discussion in the party about who will succeed Merkel is going to start a lot sooner than she wants — like immediately, right now, today, after the election,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-election-20170921-story.html;2017-09-21;German Chancellor Merkel's unflappable style may carry her to an election victory Sunday - Los Angeles Times;"After Angela Merkel was splattered with a ripe tomato hurled by a protester at a recent campaign rally, the German chancellor stayed as cool as a cucumber.
Unflappable even in the face of rising resentment over her decision to allow more than a million refugees into Germany two years ago, Merkel brushed off the tomato at the rally in Heidelberg and finished the speech in her stained blazer without saying a word about it.
The episode may help explain why so many Germans respect and appreciate Merkel, even if they do not necessarily like her. Polls indicate she is expected to win a fourth four-year term as chancellor in Sunday’s  general election.
Though the imperturbable 63-year-old physicist rubbed many in the country of about 82 million people the wrong way with her refugee policies, voters in Europe’s biggest economy know her and trust her, according to pollsters and analysts.
“Germans like stability and predictability,” said Jackson Janes, a political scientist and president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “That’s why ‘no-drama-Angela’ fits the mood. With turbulence all around, including [President] Trump’s tirades in tweets, Germans see her as a good crisis manager.”
Merkel, meanwhile, embraces her reputation for staying cool when dealing with fellow leaders such as Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“I’d say I’m able stay calm in tight spots, and that serenity is an important strength to have,” Merkel said in response to a question at a discussion with voters in Stuttgart a few hours after the incident in Heidelberg. “These meetings aren’t about making new friends. If friendships emerge, that’s great. But it’s about representing the interests of your country and it’s important to make your values known.”
In power since 2005, Merkel has guided Germany through a number of difficulties including the global financial crisis in 2008 that crippled growth in the country, the euro zone debt crisis that threatened chaos for the 28-nation European Union, and the refugee crisis that opened up rifts across Germany and the EU. As an influential leader in Europe, she faces economic and diplomatic challenges stemming from Britain’s plans to exit the EU, known as Brexit.
Merkel almost never leads the way in the global arena with bold measures or spectacular new plans. But there are exceptions, such as with her refugees position, and she tends to stand firm once she makes a decision.

“Unlike a lot of other world leaders who feel the need to immediately jump on every headline, Merkel goes quiet whenever there’s a crisis and waits as long as it takes to detect which direction public opinion is leaning,” said Julius van de Laar, an international political strategist in Berlin. “It’s almost like she’s out there surfing on a wave and waiting to see the direction it breaks.”
Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union party, or CDU, has slipped slightly in recent opinion polls but is projected to win 36% of the vote Sunday and emerge as the dominant party in a new and larger Parliament filled with six parties.
The center-left Social Democratic Party, or SPD, led by candidate Martin Schulz, is well behind with about 23% of the projected vote, even though it briefly pulled ahead of Merkel’s party early this year.
The Social Democrats unexpectedly lost three state elections in the spring to Merkel’s conservatives and gave up all the campaign momentum they had garnered when Schulz was nominated in January.
The SPD was surprised and unprepared to suddenly lead the Christian Democratic Union party in polls and failed to capitalize on the burst of support for Schulz, analysts said. He largely stayed on the sidelines during the three state elections, whereas Merkel campaigned hard for her party in all three states that served as important test runs for the general election.
In addition, the country’s economy has grown strongly during Merkel’s 12 years in power while unemployment has fallen steadily and is at 5.7%. The federal government has been running a budget surplus of up to $25 billion a year for the last three years.
“Merkel’s position isn’t as strong as it was in the previous elections, but she has a broad base of support,” said Van de Laar. “The booming economy and low unemployment is a partial explanation. But she has also hardly faced any challenge from the SPD.”
If she wins reelection, Merkel will nevertheless need a coalition partner to govern the country and that will be the biggest uncertainty Sunday.
She could pick the SPD for another “grand coalition” similar to the right-center alliance that ruled since 2013 or opt for a new government with one or two smaller parties on the ballot — such as the pro-ecology Greens or pro-business Free Democrats, which are each polling just under 10%. The far-left Linke party is also polling around 10%.
Merkel and all other parties in Parliament have already ruled out any alliance with the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which has campaigned unabashedly against the refugees from Syria and other trouble spots flooding into Germany. The AfD is expected to win seats in the Reichstag for the first time, with perhaps 10% of the vote or more.
Pollsters believe the AfD, which was formed in 2013 as an anti-euro party and fell short of the 5% threshold for inclusion in Parliament in the September 2013 election, could win more than 10% this time. Many of its supporters, who intensely dislike Merkel and her pro-refugee policies, may be concealing their true voting intentions in voter surveys, pollsters say.
“The refugee issue isn’t the red-hot topic it was a year ago,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, noting the numbers of applications for asylum and media attention on refugees have diminished sharply this year. “Support for Merkel still runs high across the country, but the difference this time is that there is a considerable minority of perhaps 15% that viscerally opposes her.”
That animosity can be seen especially at rallies in the formerly communist east, where sizable numbers of unruly hecklers have tried to disrupt her campaign rallies with nonstop whistling and jeers lasting the duration of her 40-minute stump speeches. But it’s also been visible in some affluent western towns such as Heidelberg, where she was hit by the tomato.
“She’s bounced back from the uproar over the immigrant wave because there hasn’t been another wave yet and she addressed the border control issues more directly,” said Janes. “Her biggest challenge ahead is going to be holding Europe together while negotiating Brexit.”

https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-heilbrunn-german-election-20170928-story.html;2017-09-28;Don't blame Angela Merkel for the rise of the right in Germany - Los Angeles Times;"The emergence of the radical, nationalistic Alternative for Germany party as the third-strongest contender in federal elections Sunday is creating consternation not only in Germany but also abroad.
“They are here,” read an ominous headline on the cover of the magazine Der Spiegel, which features the right-wing party’s leaders, Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, looming over Chancellor Angela Merkel, despite her reelection to a fourth (and final) term. The AfD rode to victory by attacking Islam and immigrants, decrying multiculturalism, denouncing the European Union and advocating closer ties with Russia. (Russia reciprocated by using Twitter bots to boost the party’s electoral fortunes.) Immediately after the election, a jubilant Gauland, who maintains that it’s peachy keen to laud the performance of the German army in both world wars, said he wants to “hunt” down Merkel.
As odious as Gauland, Weiland and the AfD’s positions are, the surprising thing isn’t that unabashed nationalists will enter the German Parliament with 94 seats. It’s that it didn’t happen sooner.
It’s easy to blame the radical right’s triumph on Merkel and current events. The chancellor saw her Christian Democratic Union’s share of the vote to decline to 32%, down more than five points from the 2013 election. Her emotional decision in 2015 to admit nearly 1 million refugees from the Middle East and North Africa into Germany aroused deep anger. In 2016, she acknowledged the problem when she said, “No one wants a repeat of last year’s situation.”
Merkel is confronting the greatest challenge of her 12 years in power.
But pinning the blame on Merkel only goes so far. German nationalism is an abiding force that had been artificially suppressed for decades but never fully stamped out. It first emerged in Prussia in the early 19th century, and it has been the engine of much of modern Germany’s history.
In the 1800s, many Germans became besotted with the idea of a unified country that would put an end to the welter of small Germanic states and duchies, and for them, nationalism served as a powerful, idealistic force in creating a Teutonic nation that could match — or even surpass — its neighbors, including Russia and France. This kind of liberal nationalism helped to forge a single Germany in 1871, after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck launched and won three successive wars against Denmark, Austria-Hungary and France. Soon anti-Semitism was added to the mix, and German nationalism began to go totally off the rails.
After it was established in 1949, the Bonn republic preached a culture of contrition about the Nazi past. Its legendary first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, was intent on embedding it in the West, and his slogan was the uber conservative “no experiments.” Nationalism was taboo as were any overt displays of patriotism. Many West Germans even refused to acknowledge their nationality, referring to themselves simply as Europeans.

This was not the case in East Germany, where the Communist Party pretended that it represented a nation victimized by the Nazis and again by the West. There was no admission of guilt for the Holocaust in the East, no attempt to face the full significance of Germany’s past nationalism.
When West Germany swallowed up East Germany in 1989, it was almost inevitable that some form of nationalism would resurface. Shorn of the restraints of the Cold War, when the United States was the sole protector of West Germany, the remade country was free to reach back to older traditions. Now, the demolition job that U.S. President Trump is performing on the transatlantic relationship, which was an integral part of a profoundly cautious West Germany’s identity during the postwar era, is accelerating the trend.
It isn’t surprising that the Alternative for Germany party scored its highest totals in the East — 21.5% of the vote. Only 11% supported it in the West. In the East, far-right AfD agitators like Bjoern Hoecke railed against Islam, Africans and American influence. According to Hoecke, “Our once respected army has deteriorated into a de-gendered and multiculturalized response force in the service of the USA.” The contention is that America deracinated Germans after 1945, reeducating them into passive docility.
Whether the party will be able to sell this kind of claptrap to more of the German public is an unknown. The AfD already is experiencing factional splits. Moderating figures such as party co-chair Frauke Petry have left the fold because of battles with hard-liners. (Petry is moderate only in the context of AfD: She has no patience for the Nazi vocabulary of hatemongers such as Hoecke, but she also has referred to refugees as a “compost heap.”)
Germany’s election results pose two questions: Will Merkel’s continuing popularity — or at least the safety and experience she represents — neutralize the nationalists? Or will a much more assertive Germany start engaging in adventurous political experiments? Merkel is confronting the greatest challenge of her 12 years in power. She must go from hunted to hunter.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-ap-merkel-germany-attacks-20160728-snap-story.html;2016-07-28;Angela Merkel says Germany 'will manage' challenge after attacks  - Los Angeles Times;"Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged Thursday to do “everything humanly possible” to keep Germany safe following a string of attacks — including two carried out by asylum-seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group that she said mocked the country that took in the assailants.
The attacks brought Merkel fresh criticism for her decision last year to welcome refugees. More than 1 million asylum-seekers were registered in Germany in 2015, although the influx has since slowed dramatically.
Merkel said at a news conference that Germany will “stick to our principles” and give shelter to those who deserve it.
“We will manage this,” she said, repeating a mantra she coined last August.
Merkel called for a better “early warning system” against signs of radicalization, faster progress on plans to create a center to help crack encrypted messages and better international intelligence cooperation, among other measures. But she said it’s too early to say in detail what more may be required beyond the tightening of asylum and security laws already undertaken in recent months.
“Wherever there are gaps, we will have to act — just as we have so far — so that it is clear that we are doing everything humanly possible to ensure security in our free, democratic state of law,” Merkel said.
Two of the attacks in a weeklong period starting July 18 — an ax rampage near Wuerzburg that wounded five and a suicide bombing that injured 15 outside a bar in Ansbach — were the first in Germany to be claimed by Islamic State. Both of the attackers, asylum-seekers who arrived in the last two years, were killed.
In two other attacks — a shooting by a German Iranian 18-year-old in Munich that claimed 10 lives, including the attacker’s, and the stabbing of a woman by a Syrian asylum-seeker at a restaurant in Reutlingen — the motive is still unclear but Islamic extremism is not suspected.

“We will do everything to clear up the barbaric acts, find the people behind them and punish them, and then we will have to decide where further measures are necessary,” Merkel said. She added that Germany owes that to the victims, their relatives, the nation’s own security and also “to all the many innocent refugees.”
“That two men who came to us as refugees are responsible for the acts in Wuerzburg and Ansbach mocks the country that took them in,” Merkel said. “It mocks the helpers who took so much care of the refugees and it mocks the many other refugees who really seek help against violence and war.”
We will do everything to clear up the barbaric acts, find the people behind them and punish them.
— Chancellor Angela Merkel
The chancellor cut short her vacation to schedule her annual summer news conference — only her second public appearance in the past week. She had faced criticism from opponents for her muted response to the four attacks.
Merkel dismissed that criticism, noting that she will attend a memorial service in Munich on Sunday, and rejected the notion that she might personally feel any guilt about the attacks.
“I have the feeling that I am acting responsibly and correctly, and no other feelings,” she said.
Merkel repeated unbidden her insistence that Germany “will manage” the challenges of the day — a phrase she first used at last summer’s annual news conference.
“I didn’t say 11 months ago that it would be an easy thing we could manage in passing, otherwise I wouldn’t have had to say that sentence,” she said. “But I am, today as I was then, convinced that we will manage to do justice to our historic task ... we will also deal with the new challenge we now face, Islamist terror.”
“I think that refusing humanitarian responsibility would have had just as many, or perhaps completely different but in any case very bad, consequences for us that I would not risk and could not recommend to Germany,” Merkel said.
Earlier Thursday, officials in Bavaria — the scene of three of the four attacks, and a state whose governor has long been critical of Merkel’s welcoming approach to refugees — pledged to hire hundreds of extra police officers and urged tougher background checks on asylum-seekers as they presented an anti-terrorism plan following the four attacks.
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said his state would hire some 2,000 additional police officers by 2020, improve police officers’ equipment and create new offices to fight Muslim extremism and cybercrime.
He also called for tougher background checks on asylum-seekers and new strategies to deport criminal asylum-seekers more easily.
Merkel said of the plan that “there are a lot of things on which we agree.”

Merkel, who has supported an open-door policy for migrants, said Germany, Italy and Greece were dealing with the bulk of the challenges associated with accommodating hundreds of thousands of people who have made their way on perilous voyages to Europe.
The 28-nation European Union has not done enough to balance the distribution of migrants or provide services for them, she said. Many migrants and refugees have fled poverty and fighting in their home countries, many coming from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
“Europe hasn’t been doing its homework,” Merkel, who is expected to win a fourth term during a Sept. 24 election, told reporters. “We still don’t have a fair system of distribution [of migrants and refugees]. We still have a lot of work to do on that score. We have to fight the causes that people are fleeing.”
Merkel’s comments came a day after a meeting in Paris in which France, Germany, Italy and Spain agreed to a plan intended to counter human traffickers by allowing vulnerable African migrants to apply for asylum in Europe while in Africa, rather than after they reach Europe. African countries through which migrants often pass on their way to Europe would get help to control their borders, the leaders said.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the summit, called the gathering the most effective and far-reaching migration meeting in months, though many details remained undetermined, the Associated Press reported.
Fayez Serraj, the prime minister of Libya’s U.N.-backed government, Chadian President Idriss Deby and Niger’s president, Mahamadou Issoufou, stressed that fighting poverty must be a central part of any migration strategy, the AP reported.
Merkel said it was important to more clearly differentiate between those fleeing poverty, who usually are not granted asylum, and those whose needs are humanitarian and usually do receive asylum protection. She said the goal was to put an end to illegal migration.

Germany has taken in more than a million migrants from Syria, Iraq and other troubled countries over the last two years. Sweden and Austria also took in larger numbers of migrants earlier in the crisis but Germany, the EU’s richest country, has shouldered most of the burden with Greece and Italy over the last year.
To spread the migrants across the continent, the EU devised a plan in 2015 to relocate across the bloc about 160,000 asylum seekers who arrived in Italy and Greece, countries that serve as a gateway to Europe and have been overwhelmed by the crisis.
Although popular across much of Germany, Merkel has nevertheless faced withering heckling and jeers at some of her recent campaign rallies over her decision to allow in such large numbers of migrants for what she called humanitarian reasons.
A total of 123,644 people risked their lives to flee to Europe by sea this year through Aug. 29, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It estimated that 2,421 people were feared drowned so far this year.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-schulz-20170823-story.html;2017-08-24;German rival of Chancellor Merkel vows to remove U.S. nuclear weapons from the country - Los Angeles Times;"In a bid to jump-start his flagging campaign to lead Germany, Martin Schulz of the center-left Social Democrats has made a startling campaign promise, saying he would remove U.S. nuclear weapons from the country if he became chancellor.
Feeding on widespread fears among Germans of a possible conflict after President Trump’s recent exchange of tough talk with North Korea, Schulz ratcheted up his anti-nuclear weapons language at a campaign rally late Tuesday.
He called for the removal of about 20 U.S. nuclear warheads that according to German media reports are believed to be stationed in the western part of Germany — until now largely forgotten vestiges of the Cold War that ended nearly 30 years ago. Government officials have not confirmed the presence of nuclear warheads in Germany.
“As chancellor, I’d push for the ejection of nuclear weapons stored in Germany and if they’re stationed in this state of Rhineland-Palatinate, then for the removal of those weapons here,” Schulz told a campaign rally in the southwestern state, which has long been home to several large U.S. bases.
Schulz said Trump’s conflict with North Korea “shows us more than ever before how urgently we need to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and encourage disarmament.”
Schulz’s party is stuck some 14 percentage points behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union with just one month of campaigning before the Sept. 24 election.
The challenger’s antiwar language can go down exceptionally well among voters in Germany, where memories of the two world wars it started in the last century linger even generations later. Other Social Democratic Party chancellors, from Willy Brandt, who won the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize for his Ostpolitik, to Gerhard Schroeder, who won reelection in 2002 against long odds with an anti-Iraq war campaign, have successfully tapped into that pacifist streak.
Merkel did not immediately comment on Schulz’s remarks this week. But a Merkel ally criticized Schulz for overly simplifying a complicated topic in the heat of an election campaign.

“I’d advise Martin Schulz against compromising Germany’s position in its carefully calibrated international security architecture for a play to the gallery,” Juergen Hardt, Merkel’s transatlantic policy coordinator, said in an interview. “A credible nuclear deterrent is a pivotal element of NATO’s defense posture. And Germany will remain a partner to that.”
Some political scientists said Schulz, frustrated by his party’s inability to narrow the gap with Merkel’s conservatives in polls, felt compelled to ramp up the rhetoric in a Hail Mary attempt to shake up the campaign. They estimate his party, the SPD, currently the junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition government, needs to at least halve the conservatives’ 39%-25% lead in polls to have a chance of keeping its seats in the next government after the election.
“Schulz is desperately grappling to try to find an issue that will excite voters,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “He hasn’t gotten anywhere by talking about social inequality or standing up for the little guy that the SPD likes to focus on.”
Jaeger said a former German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, had made a similar demand in 2010 for U.S. nuclear warheads to be removed that briefly caused tension in Merkel’s coalition government with his pro-business Free Democratic Party and between Berlin and Washington.
The Free Democrats were then trounced in the 2014 election, not only falling out of the government but also even failing to clear the 5% threshold needed to win seats in the Parliament.
“Westerwelle took a beating for that because it made a lot of people think he didn’t have a clue about what he was doing on foreign policy,” Jaeger said.
Hajo Funke, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University, said Schulz may manage to attract voters to the SPD with his unorthodox attempt to shake up what has until now been viewed by many as a dull and predictable campaign.
“Germans are all ears when it comes to talking about peace and disarmament,” Funke said. “It’s a sexy campaign issue for him and what’s wrong with that? Trump is clearly a loose cannon out there, and that’s the last thing you need when there are nuclear weapons on the deck.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-brexit-20160628-snap-story.html;2016-06-28;Merkel warns British against 'deluding themselves' in departure from EU - Los Angeles Times;"Britain may have just lost the last friend it had in the European Union, less than a week after the country voted to abandon the group of nations that had been a pillar of peace and prosperity for the last six decades. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned in no uncertain terms Tuesday that Britain can forget about any special favors or advantageous trading privileges with the EU.
“I can only urge our friends in Britain against deluding themselves,” said Merkel, who has quietly emerged as the EU’s most powerful leader during her 10 years guiding the union’s largest economy and most populous nation.
Meanwhile, fallout from the referendum continued to shake up the political landscape in Britain. Labor party leader Jeremy Corbyn lost a confidence vote among party lawmakers, though he said in a statement that he would not resign.
Also on Tuesday, UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage was booed as he addressed the European Parliament. He said that other member states would soon follow Britain’s lead in leaving the union, and scoffed at the idea that Britain would lose out on trade with the EU. “Between your countries and my country, we do an enormous amount of business in goods and services,” Farage said. “That trade is mutually beneficial to both of us. That trade matters. If you were to decide to cut off your noses to spite your faces and to reject any idea of a sensible trade deal, the consequences would be far worse for you than it would be for us.”
Just spoke in the European Parliament, they were pleased to see me as you can tell.https://t.co/7TRJlBXLJl
In the initial aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the union, Merkel had struck a conciliatory note, saying on Saturday and again Monday that nothing would change until Britain itself made a formal request to leave the EU. But her tone cooled on Tuesday after a Monday evening meeting in Berlin with French President Francois Hollande, Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and EU Commission President Donald Tusk.
All three want the EU to take a tougher line to discourage other nations from following Britain’s example. Anti-EU sentiment is already running high in countries such as the Netherlands, France and Denmark.
Merkel said Britain’s decision to “leave the family” was regrettable, but also a chance for a new start – music to the ears of more interventionist governments in France, Italy and Spain that had clashed with Britain over its foot-dragging in the EU. They now hope to turn the EU into more of a socialist superstate with greater federal authority as an antidote to a prolonged period of weak economic growth.

“We’re going to ensure that there won’t be any cherry-picking in the negotiations,” Merkel said, dousing hopes nurtured in Britain that it might get the best of both worlds after leaving the EU: open access to the union’s market of some 500 million people without having to accept the principles of freedom of movement for its people that are at the core of the EU. Merkel was uncharacteristically blunt in saying that isn’t going to happen.
“Anyone who wants to leave this family can’t for a moment be allowed to think they can keep all the privileges of membership without carrying any of the responsibilities,” she said to loud applause from members of parliament in Berlin’s Reichstag building before flying to Brussels for a two-day summit with the leaders of the 28 EU member states. “There will obviously have to be a perceptible difference between countries in the EU family and those on the outside.”
Her remarks seemed to pour cold water on the hopes Boris Johnson expressed Monday that Britain would continue to benefit from being part of Europe. Johnson, an outspoken pro-leave leader in Britain’s Conservative party, is a top candidate to succeed lame-duck Prime Minster David Cameron, who said he would resign after leading the failed remain campaign. Amid a financial market meltdown after the vote and growing public anger in Britain over immediate backsliding on leave campaign promises, Johnson also said he expects there will be increased cooperation between Britain and the EU after “Brexit” – even though many who voted to leave the EU did so in the belief that it would enable Britain to stop the flow of immigrants to the country.
Merkel pointed out that Norway – one country outside the EU that nevertheless enjoys close trade ties – also accepts the EU’s core demand of freedom of movement for its citizens. “The basic freedom of access has to be accepted for there to be free access to the EU market,” Merkel said. “Norway has access because it freely accepts immigration from the EU.”
Merkel also appeared to raise the bar on the looming divorce negotiations with Britain. She said there would be no talks at all with the British government until it submits an application to leave, which will start the clock ticking for a two-year period to hammer out the terms of the split. Even though Cameron had said the application to leave would be submitted right after the referendum, he has since backpedaled and said that step would have to be made by his successor – indicating a prolonged process that could last two months or more.

“Let there be no mistake about it,” said Merkel, who rarely speaks in such pointed terms as she did in Tuesday’s remarks, “before the application to leave is submitted, there will be no preliminary discussions whatsoever with Britain about their wish to leave, either on a formal or informal basis.”
“The EU is strong enough to handle Britain’s exit,” she added.
Thomas Oppermann, the parliamentary floor leader of the center-left Social Democrats, junior coalition partners to Merkel’s conservatives, told parliament after Merkel’s speech that it is important to take a hard line against Britain in Brussels, at the summit and beyond.
“There can be no rewards for leaving the EU, and no bonus for nationalism or anti-EU attitudes,” he said.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-merkel-trump-relationship-20170708-story.html;2017-07-08;Trump and Merkel's relationship shows no thaw after G-20 summit - Los Angeles Times;"President Trump’s tense relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel hasn’t gotten any better after a two-day Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where Trump was isolated on the other leaders’ climate resolution.
“I can’t exactly judge how things will be tomorrow or the day after,” Merkel said at a news conference after the summit finished Saturday.
Trump’s private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin stole the show at the G-20. But it was Merkel who was in the hot seat as she shepherded the 19 other leaders through tricky negotiations and brushed aside speculation that Trump would upend the rest of the group’s common ground on issues ranging from economic policy to development and trade.
Violent protests outside the summit increased pressure on Merkel. She is in the middle of an election campaign and despite her comfortable lead in polls, Martin Schulz, the Social Democratic candidate who is challenging her, recently amped up his criticism of her for not standing up to Trump.
Her strained relationship with Trump was on display during the summit on her home turf — her last big international meeting before the September election. She fielded journalists’ questions about her relationship with Trump and his daughter Ivanka’s participation at a G-20 event on women’s entrepreneurship — Ivanka was booed when she spoke at an event in Berlin this spring.
Merkel’s relationship with Trump buckled earlier this year when he complained about Germany’s trade surplus with the U.S. and threatened to impose tariffs on imports from the country.
Trump praised the German chancellor on Saturday, telling her, “You have been amazing, and you have done a fantastic job.” But Merkel made clear that the two leaders still don’t see eye to eye.
“I can only take things as they are,” Merkel told reporters on Saturday.

Merkel said that it was especially difficult to negotiate with Trump on trade and climate issues.
A resolution on the Group of 20’s positions published at the end of the summit singles out the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which caps emission levels. Other countries that supported the document include oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia.
Merkel made efforts to explain after the summit that she did not broker a watered-down G-20 resolution full of concessions to Trump, even though the document mentions that his view on climate policy differs from other leaders’.
Officials working at European Union institutions pushed during document negotiations to remove a sentence referencing the United States’ plan to help other countries “use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently,” one EU official said on condition of anonymity.
Europeans did not want any mention of fossil fuels, and they were supported by a “critical mass of countries,” the official said on Saturday.
Government officials who did the legwork to prepare the resolution wanted to contain Trump’s views on climate change as a way to alleviate any doubt that the agreement could crash without the U.S. involved. Other leaders doubled down on their pledge to cut emissions under the Paris accord.
“Where there is no consensus, there has to be dissonance,” Merkel said, adding that she approved of the other countries’ commitment to the Paris agreement.
“The communiqué could only be agreed in the way it was agreed with the United States.”
On top of Merkel’s delicate negotiating tactics over climate policy, she said talks with Trump on trade issues were “especially hard”.
The resolution includes references to fighting trade protectionism as well as an olive branch to Trump in a line mentioning the use of “legitimate trade defense instruments” to make trade fairer.
But Trump’s relationship with European leaders is still tense.
Before meeting British Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of the G-20 talks on Saturday, Trump struck a nerve.
A trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. will be done “very, very quickly,” Trump said, once the country finishes negotiations to leave the European Union, which are expected to end in 2019. Britain’s trade deals are a sore point for European leaders who say the U.K. cannot legally start working out new agreements until it officially leaves the 28-country bloc and stops applying its trade laws.
Those tensions will be on display again next week when Trump returns to Europe for a World War I ceremony with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Macron has criticized Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement and encouraged American climate scientists to move to France.
At a news conference at the end of the G-20, Macron said, “Our world has never been so divided.”

Even though Germany, generally considered progressive on social issues, was one of the first European countries to legalize same-sex partnerships, in 2001, Merkel’s conservative-led government since 2005 repeatedly refused to consider granting full legal rights for same-sex unions because of staunch opposition from her party’s right wing.
Already leery of Merkel because she eliminated military conscription, which the right cherished, and decided to close down the country’s nuclear power plants, the conservatives in her ruling Christian Democratic Union watched helplessly Monday evening as Merkel discarded yet another sacred chapter of their playbook by telling a group of readers from a women’s magazine that she was now in favor of an open vote in Parliament on same-sex marriage.
“I would like to steer the discussion more into the direction of a question-of-conscience vote rather than me forcing through [Parliament] a majority decision,” Merkel said. By that, she meant she would rather allow members of her party to vote according to their conscience on same-sex marriage than be forced to vote as a bloc.
Because most other major parties in Germany are demanding legislation allowing same-sex marriage, the measure would almost certainly be passed quickly by the new Parliament’s lower house, the Bundestag, shortly after the election.
Merkel stopped short of explicitly speaking in favor of same-sex marriage, relying on her typically understated and opaque style of speech. But her remarks were widely seen in Germany as a reversal of her opposition, and they dominated headlines and the airwaves Tuesday.
Stern magazine called it a “bombshell” that shattered “one of the pillars” of conservatism in Germany.

Despite her popularity across Germany and the perception that she is at the peak of her powers, Merkel’s hand may have been forced because several would-be coalition partners are demanding support for same-sex marriage as a condition for joining an alliance with her party after the September election.
Merkel is widely expected to win a fourth, four-year term to lead Europe’s largest economic power. Some members of Parliament are calling for a quick vote on the marriage issue this week, the final week the Bundestag meets before the election, but that is considered unlikely.
It remains to be seen how the conservative wing of her party will react to the surprising turn of events. Leaders in the archconservative Christian Social Union, the Christian Democrats’ Bavarian sister party, already expressed their opposition. “I don’t want to see this issue ever discussed in Parliament,” said Peter Ramsauer, a leader of the Bavarian party.
Merkel, who had spoken out firmly against same-sex marriage in the election campaign four years ago because she feared negative consequences for adopted children, shifted gears by mentioning at the event in Berlin, organized by Brigitte magazine, that she recently had an epiphany on the issue.
“I had a life-changing experience in my home constituency,” Merkel explained during a question-and-answer session with the audience. She said she had been invited to dinner with a woman and her partner who were caring for eight foster children. She saw that the children were well cared for, and it dawned on her that her party’s arguments against same-sex marriage were no longer valid.
“If the youth welfare service entrusts a lesbian couple with eight foster children, then the state could no longer use child welfare as an argument against adoptions,” she said.
The opposition from Merkel’s government has been oddly out of tune with much of Europe and the rest of the country, which, according to polls, has long favored same-sex marriage. Yet Merkel’s popularity has remained high over the last 12 years and she is well ahead of her nearest rival in polls.
“Merkel switched her position now to prevent the [political opposition] from attacking her on it in the campaign,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “About 80% of the people in Germany are in favor and she’s willing to take on a few hard-line conservatives in her own ranks.”
Despite its progressive traditions and early acceptance of same-sex partnerships nearly two decades ago, Germany had been overtaken in allowing same-sex marriage by many other Western European countries, including the Netherlands, those in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and even Roman Catholic-dominated ones such as France, Spain and Ireland.
Germany has had a number of popular gay leaders in the last decade, including former Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit from the center-left Social Democrats and former Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust from Merkel’s conservatives. The late Guido Westerwelle, Germany’s foreign minister in Merkel’s government from 2009 to 2013, lived in a “registered partnership” with his partner, and Merkel spoke at his funeral.

..
To the editor: The media have erroneously analyzed and evaluated Trump’s recent trip abroad according to their traditional standards and not the reality of the man who is president.
Trump is criticized for haranguing NATO leaders for paying less than their promised 2% of gross national product and for not committing to the Paris climate agreement. Why the surprise over this behavior? Trump has been clear on these issues since the start of his presidential campaign in 2015.
Unlike our last president, Trump does not seem to care about world public opinion, following the usual protocols or kissing up to other world leaders. He steadfastly is guided by his view of what is best for American interests and, in his own often bumbling and occasionally offensive way, he consistently follows that course.

There should be no surprises here. Trump does what he’s said he would do.
Glynn Morris, Playa del Rey

To the editor: One wishes that Trump’s friendly take on foreign policy included leaders like Merkel rather than strongmen like Russia’s Putin, Turkey’s Erdogan or the Philippines’ Duterte, and absolute monarchs like those in Saudi Arabia, where an extreme interpretation of the Koran is the basis for the subjugation of all women.
We know that a minority president like Trump harbors desires to have absolute power as these leaders do and feels unfairly constrained by the press and the courts. But most of us know that being friends with dictators is not good for our country or for the world.

Merkel spent the last six months trying to connect with Trump to maintain U.S. support on a variety of issues.
But she struck of tone of exasperation Sunday following a week in which Trump refused to commit the United States to the 2015 Paris accord on climate change and failed to explicitly endorse the NATO military alliance core principle, known as Article 5, which says an attack against one member is an attack against all members.
“The era in which we could rely completely on others are gone, at least partially,” Merkel said at a rally in Munich, where she was campaigning for a fourth term in office. “I experienced that over the last several days.”
“As a result of all that, I can only say that it is now time that we really take our own fate into our own hands,” she told a crowd of 2,500 in a beer tent. “Naturally, we’ll maintain our friendship with the United States… wherever possible. But we have to realize that we Europeans are going to have to fight for our own behalf.”
She did not mention Trump by name. But her frustration with him was clear after two international summits they both attended last week: a NATO meeting in Brussels and a gathering of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Italy.
She told reporters in Italy that talking with Trump about climate change — one of her signature issues since the 1990s — had been “extremely difficult, indeed unsatisfying. It’s a situation where there are six countries lined up against one.”
Germany has long been among the closest allies of the U.S. The Group of Seven also includes Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan.

During his election campaign last year, Trump disparaged Merkel for letting in more than a million refugees, mainly from Syria, saying she was “ruining Germany.”
When Trump won, Merkel called to offer congratulations but also admonished him to keep in mind the importance of democratic values and to respect people’s dignity regardless of their origin or the color of their skin, gender, sexual orientation or politics.
In April, she hosted Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, on a panel to discuss women’s issues — a move widely interpreted as an attempt to court the new administration.
Merkel told a German newspaper that that month that she and Trump had been cooperating with a common strategy on Ukraine, Syria, the fight against terrorism and other conflicts. “President Trump and I have developed a good working relationship,” she said.
Her pragmatism was aimed at maintaining U.S. support for NATO and preventing a trade war with the U.S., a major customer for German exports. But to many voters, it came across as an effort to appease Trump, who is widely scorned in Germany.
Merkel’s shift in language on Sunday was calculated to help her in her bid for reelection in September, political analysts said.
“To preserve her own credibility, she had to speak out against Trump,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “But for someone as cautious as Merkel, it is still astonishing for her to take the lead in Europe against Trump on something like this. It’s incredible to see her take the leadership.”
Merkel, who has been in office since 2005, stands a high chance of reelection. Her conservative Christian Democrats have won three straight state elections in the last two months, and in polling she and her party have surged ahead of the center-left Social Democrats and their candidate, Martin Shulz.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-regional-election-20170507-story.html;2017-05-07;A sweet victory for Angela Merkel in the dairy lands of northern Germany - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s reelection hopes in September’s federal election were unexpectedly bolstered on Sunday when her conservative party came from behind to score a decisive victory in a small, windswept state on the Danish border.
The stunning triumph by her Christian Democrats over the ruling center-left Social Democrats in the largely rural state of Schleswig-Holstein, home to 2.3 million voters and 400,000 dairy cows, gave Merkel an improbable boost four months before the federal election and badly needed momentum ahead of next Sunday’s more important regional election in the country’s most populous state — North Rhine-Westphalia, with 13 million voters.
Merkel is seeking a fourth four-year term on Sept. 24, and her party allies had shown signs of panic that they could lose power after the conservatives slipped behind the Social Democrats in national opinion polls in January for the first time in 11 years. That was after the long-suffering center-left party had picked a colorful, straight-talking, multilingual challenger to Merkel: Martin Schulz.
“This hurts like hell,” said a dejected Schulz after TV network projections showed the Social Democrats picking up less than 27% of the vote in the northernmost state, a drop of nearly 4 percentage points from the last election. Merkel’s conservatives won 32.5%, up 1.7 percentage points.
Throughout the campaign, Merkel, who has shaken off signs of fatigue over the unrelenting criticism from party allies over her decision to allow in more than a million refugees from Syria and elsewhere in 2015, remained unflappable and stoically confident in her party’s chances.
Her steady handling of an awkward first meeting with President Trump at the White House in March and the improvement in their relationship also helped lift Merkel’s standing, political scientists said. Trump even surprised Merkel by calling to congratulate her after her conservatives held on to power with a win in another regional election in March in the small state of Saarland.
The Social Democrats’ state premier in Schleswig-Holstein, Torsten Albig, committed a colossal blunder shortly before Sunday’s election, telling celebrity magazine Bunte that he had left his wife for another woman because their interests had diverged over the years after she became a stay-at-home mom.

Since taking power in 2005, Merkel’s Christian Democrats have lost control of six of Germany’s 16 states and now rule just five.
Her party now will try to form a government with two smaller parties in the state — the Greens, which won about 13% and the Free Democrats, which won just over 11%. If that fails, the Christian Democrats could form a government with the defeated Social Democrats.

The conservatives’ improbable come-from-behind triumph in heavily industrial North Rhine-Westphalia, long a bastion for the Social Democratic party and home to nearly a quarter of Germany’s voters, gave the chancellor a powerful gust of tailwind just four months before the federal election on Sept. 24.
Palpable frustration over worsening traffic congestion and crime that has plagued the crowded northwestern state, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, were the decisive factors behind the Social Democrats’ sudden demise after the party had ruled there for 46 of the last 51 years.
Within minutes of the polls closing, the state’s governor resigned, saying she took “personal responsibility for the defeat,” which amounted to her party’s worst showing in the region since World War II.
“I did the best I could,” said Gov. Hannelore Kraft.
Merkel’s conservative allies celebrated the unlikely win with shouts of joy and champagne toasts at raucous victory parties in Berlin and in the state capital, Dusseldorf.
The election in North Rhine-Westphalia came just three months after national opinion polls showed the Social Democrats and their charismatic new leader, Martin Schulz, pulling ahead of Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union for the first time in 11 years.
“I’m not a magician,” said a dejected Schulz at his party’s headquarters in Berlin, describing it as a bitter defeat in his home state. The rout seemed to confirm opinion polls that show the Social Democrats fading fast at both the state and national levels.

Merkel, who has won three federal elections since 2005, was beginning to show signs of fatigue earlier this year following a steady drumbeat of criticism over her 2015 decision to allow more than 1 million refugees into Germany.
But the 62-year-old chancellor appeared to be only rejuvenated by the sky-is-falling fears from some within her party. Her recent international travels to Washington to meet President Trump and to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin have helped reinforce her image at home as a global figure and as a steady hand at a time of international turmoil.
“This is a very big win indeed for Merkel because it’s going to silence her opponents inside her party,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “At the same time, she’s also dealt the [Social Democrats] a major defeat by taking away control of a state they thought they owned.”
Projections based on exit polls and early vote counts showed the Christian Democrats winning 33% of the vote, up from 26% in the last election in 2012.
The projections showed the ruling center-left coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens taking a clobbering, with the two parties getting 31.5% and 6%, respectively, down sharply from five years ago. The Christian Democrats will most likely try to form a government with the pro-business Free Democrats, which won 12%, or with the defeated Social Democrats as junior partners.
Merkel’s party scored a similar upset win over a Social Democrats-Greens coalition in the rural northern state of Schleswig-Holstein on May 7 after pulling off an unexpectedly strong win in the small state of Saarland, on the French border, on March 26. The March victory prompted Trump to place a congratulatory call to Merkel just nine days after they had talked about the state elections at the White House.
Nearly 18 million people live in North Rhine-Westphalia, home to four of the country’s nine largest cities, including Cologne and Dusseldorf, as well as to 10 million cars. The number of cars has jumped by more than 1 million since 2011, though the population has remained steady and the number of construction sites has risen dramatically.
A German motorist association went to the trouble of tallying the total number of recorded traffic jams in the last year — 218,000, an increase of 20% from 2015. That’s an average of about 600 notable jams in the state every day in 2016. The total mileage of traffic backed up in North Rhine-Westphalia last year stretched to 242,500 miles, or more than double the 100,625 miles recorded in 2012.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-trump-merkel-2017-story.html;2017-03-13;After a rocky start, Trump and Merkel are set to meet. Can they overcome their differences? - Los Angeles Times;"When President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel sit down at the White House on Tuesday, it will be a meeting of two leaders who could hardly be more different — and whose political relationship got off to a decidedly rocky start.
Where Trump is brash and unorthodox, Merkel is understated, even dour, and predictable. Trump was raised amid wealth and glitz; Merkel grew up in the gray world of Communist East Germany.
Trump has repeatedly criticized Merkel for allowing more than a million refugees into Germany over the last two years, has cast aspersions on NATO and has raised the specter of trade wars — a scary proposition for Germany, which relies on exports for half of its gross domestic product.
Merkel, for her part, offered a decidedly backhanded congratulations to Trump for his election victory in November with a moralizing reminder of democratic values.
Still, analysts, diplomats and her political allies in Germany believe Merkel can and will do all she can to work closely and harmoniously with Trump — her third U.S. president. Their meeting has the potential to be one of the most important of the year for both leaders, with much at stake for transatlantic relations and international trade.
Merkel has an impressive track record of developing pragmatic working relationships with a long line of difficult men, notably including Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She helped forge a peace treaty in Ukraine with the former and created a plan to slow the flood of Syrian refugees into Europe with the latter.
Her serenity has always been the ace up her sleeve. She’s figured out a way to work with pretty much everyone.
— Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at Goettingen University
Merkel got along well with George W. Bush, even though he was enormously disliked across Germany. Merkel even figured out how to get her way with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, like many men before him, made the mistake of underestimating her.

“She has seen European leaders come and go — very charismatic, very dynamic, very boisterous leaders,” Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said during a conference call Friday. “She has this history and this approach to leaders [who] may be in fact very unpredictable.” Conley added that it was vital for Trump and Merkel to get the relationship right.
“While personal chemistry isn’t the be-all, end-all, it is important. It sets the tone,” she said. “She’s doing the right thing by coming.”
A trained physicist with a doctorate and a pastor’s daughter, Merkel also got off on the wrong foot with President Obama by nixing the then-presidential candidate’s plans to speak at the Brandenburg Gate just four months before the 2008 presidential election, forcing him to speak in front of a lesser backdrop two miles away from the heart of Berlin. Their relationship was later set back by the revelation in 2013 that the United States had been monitoring her cellphone.
Nevertheless, they eventually became such close allies that Obama told Germans in November he would vote for Merkel if he could.
“There’s no point trying to ram your head through the wall — because at the end of the day the wall is always going to win,” is one of the 62-year-old Merkel’s favorite sayings when she wants to describe the futility of pointless battles.
“Her serenity has always been the ace up her sleeve,” said Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at Goettingen University. “She’s figured out a way to work with pretty much everyone.”
Always a quick study, Merkel has remained popular across party lines in Germany thanks to her steady hand and a dull, unflappable style that’s well suited to a country that has harbored a deep-seated fear of rabble-rousers over the seven decades since the end of its Nazi nightmare. Even after 12 years in power, Merkel is showing no signs of fatigue and remains the odds-on favorite to win a fourth term in an election on Sept. 24.
She bears no grudges and has made it clear that she is interested in forging a  alliance with Trump — despite his bashing of her open-door policies on Syrian refugees.
“I’ll be talking about the interests of our countries and will try to identify as much common ground as possible,” Merkel said in her typically prosaic fashion on Friday.
In hopes of finding common language with the career businessman, Merkel will be bringing some of Germany’s top business leaders with her.
According to a report in Der Spiegel news magazine, the chief executives of BMW and Siemens will accompany Merkel to the White House, a not-so-subtle reminder that Siemens employs 70,000 people in the United States and BMW’s largest factory is in South Carolina. Trump’s campaign threat of imposing a 35% import tax on German cars caused widespread fears in Germany, a country whose prosperity is based on its perpetual trade surplus.
“She’ll very much be interested in standing up for the interests of German industry at the meeting with Trump,” said Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “The carmakers are especially concerned about what he’s been saying.”
To learn more about Trump, Merkel and her advisors have reportedly been studying his speeches and interviews — even unearthing a cover story on Trump in Playboy magazine in 1990.
Free trade and open markets will be one of the main issues on Merkel’s mind while Trump will want to talk about Germany adhering to a pledge to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. Germany’s defense spending rose 8% last year and Merkel has said she plans to raise it from the current 1% of GDP to 2% by 2024.
Merkel will probably remind Trump of the perils of isolationism and that with private companies thriving in global markets because of their high quality and strong competitive position, there is nothing the German government can do to reduce its widening trade surplus, which hit a record of $270 billion in 2016.
Still, she acknowledged in an interview with German journalists recently: “It’s difficult to plan a strategy — with someone like Trump I have to rely on reflexes.”
For his part, Trump will be interested in getting advice from Merkel on how to deal with Putin, U.S. officials said in Washington on Friday. Merkel’s background gives her unusual insight into Putin, who was once a KGB spy in East Germany. Just as Putin speaks German, Merkel speaks Russian, and she intimately understands the world view of someone raised in the Soviet system.
Putin may have also set the bar for what Merkel considers a difficult meeting. When he met with Merkel in Sochi, Russia, in 2007, he brought his black Labrador — despite her fear of dogs that stemmed from once being bitten. Pictures of their meeting show Merkel struggling to remain calm as the dog sniffed around her legs.
“Even though I think the Russian president knew full well that I wasn’t thrilled to meet his dog, he brought him in,” Merkel said in a newspaper interview. “You can see how I gallantly I tried to keep my eyes on Putin rather than the dog.”
Merkel recently joked to a group of journalists that, after that, she was ready for anything.
As luck would have it, Trump is the first canine-free American president since William McKinley (1897-1901). “I’m glad that, as far as I know, he doesn’t have a dog,” Merkel told journalists recently with a laugh.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-wiretap-claim-20170318-story.html;2017-03-18;Trump doubles down on unproven wiretap claim by making a joke about Germany's Angela Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"President Trump refused Friday to back off his unsubstantiated accusation that President Obama ordered surveillance of him, instead dismissing questions about it by cracking a joke that revived one of the most troublesome diplomatic episodes of Obama’s tenure.
Trump was asked twice about his wiretap claim during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He ignored the first question and only briefly addressed the issue in answering the second.
For the record:
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the British prime minister at the time of the 2003 Iraq invasion. It was Tony Blair, not David Cameron.
“As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,” Trump said, gesturing toward Merkel and prompting an awkward smile from the German leader as she shuffled papers at an adjacent lectern.
Trump was referring to a disclosure in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had spied in Germany, including monitoring Merkel’s cellphone. The revelation dealt a major blow to U.S.-German relations and damaged Merkel’s standing at home. The U.S. had to make a significant diplomatic effort to patch up the relationship.
Friday’s comments, in which the president variously blamed reporters, a Fox News commentator and British officials for rousing the debate, added to what has become worldwide fallout from Trump’s allegations against Obama, made in a series of early-morning tweets March 4. The issue has consumed attention and energy that Trump might have otherwise spent to sell Republicans’ healthcare plan or his budget proposal or to contain the growing nuclear danger in North Korea.
Despite an avalanche of rebuttals from top intelligence officials and members of his own party, Trump has refused to apologize or retract the explosive allegation against his predecessor.
Republican leaders have grown visibly frustrated at having to answer questions about the claim, which the White House defended even after leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees said this week that they had seen no evidence to substantiate it.
In reviving the sore point with Merkel, Trump risked upsetting a delicate relationship with an important partner, which was already frayed by insults Trump lobbed at her during the presidential campaign in which he said she was ruining Germany by accepting too many refugees.

The controversy caused a separate rift with Great Britain, another close ally.
The British were ruffled after Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, read from a series of news stories while mounting a lengthy and vigorous defense of Trump’s accusation during Thursday’s televised White House briefing. One story included an allegation from Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano that Obama had used British spies to snoop on Trump at his New York high-rise.
The British government was not happy.
The allegations are “nonsense” and “should be ignored,” said an official for Britain’s General Communications Headquarters, its secretive signals intelligence agency, in a rare statement.
British media reported that Spicer and H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security advisor, issued a formal apology. A White House official who declined to be named pushed back against that characterization. The official conceded that British Ambassador Kim Darroch and Mark Lyall Grant, Britain’s national security advisor, “expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and Gen. McMaster.”
“Mr. Spicer and Gen. McMaster both explained that he was simply pointing to public reports and not endorsing any specific story,” said the White House official, who would not be named while describing private discussions between U.S. and British officials.
Trump also brushed the issue aside during his news conference.
“That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox,” Trump said. “And so you shouldn’t be talking to me. You should be talking to Fox. OK?”
But even Fox News, the conservative network that Trump considers a media ally, was unwilling to stand behind the commentary. Within minutes of Trump’s comments, anchor Shepard Smith attempted to distance the network from Trump’s allegations.
“Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-president of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way, full stop,” he said.
Despite all the blowback, Spicer made no effort to retract his efforts at defending his boss.
“I don’t think we regret anything,” he told reporters Friday. “We literally listed a litany of media reports that are in the public domain.”
One House Republican called on Trump to apologize to Obama.
“Frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, then ... President Obama is owed an apology in that regard,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). “Because if he didn’t do it, we shouldn’t be reckless in accusations that he did.”
Obama, who has previously denied ordering a wiretap of Trump, stayed silent. But his former aides fumed.
“Spicer’s slam against the British yesterday and the president’s snide reference to a sticking point in modern U.S.-German relations, which the Obama administration worked assiduously to overcome, is just another indication that this administration prioritizes the president’s personal vanity over our broader national interests,” Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and spokesman for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, wrote in an email.
Despite the raw nerves, the impact on the relationship with Britain will likely be short-lived and limited to top diplomats. U.S. and British intelligence agents have worked side by side for decades, and those working-level relationships are unlikely to be derailed by a dust-up with the White House.
Officers and investigators with the two countries’ spy agencies work daily at the ground level to share information on moves by China and Russia, dismantle international criminal networks and stop terrorist attacks, among other operations. They are among the so-called Five Eyes nations, along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand, that have an expansive intelligence-sharing agreement.
But there is a concern that if unfounded accusations are repeated over time, the confidence that close allies have in Trump’s judgment could erode. U.S. and British intelligence officers are still bruised by the series of misjudgments over former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction that then-President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair used to justify the Iraq invasion.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-cdu-20151212-story.html;2015-12-12;Germany's Angela Merkel faces discontent at home over refugee crisis - Los Angeles Times;"She is one of the most powerful women in the world, and from the outside looking in it might appear that she is at the peak of her powers after 10 years as the leader of Europe’s biggest and steadily growing economy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has thrown open the gates to a million refugees this year, led Europe’s efforts to save Greece from financial ruin and brokered a cease-fire in Ukraine.
But seen from the inside, the chancellor’s political power has been seriously eroded. Her popularity has been in free fall over the last three months amid xenophobic fears that refugees are overrunning the country and the government is losing control of its borders. Merkel faces a showdown with her own ruling conservative party this weekend when the Christian Democrats meet at their annual party congress.
The 1,000 delegates from across Germany will meet Sunday in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe for three days of speeches and debates about the course of the party, which has ruled Germany for 26 of the last 33 years.
It is normally a civilized gathering with lots of speeches and a few controlled debates, after which Merkel has been reelected unchallenged as party leader every other year with up to 98% of the vote. There will be no vote this year, but plenty of testy debate is expected to surround the woman who was just named Time magazine’s person of the year for her European leadership in the debt and refugee crises.
Many of the Christian Democratic delegates — for the most part elected officials and officeholders from the Baltic Sea to the Black Forest — are upset about Merkel’s open-door policies on Syrian refugees because they fear many conservative voters will abandon the party, turn for a new far-right party or simply stay at home in three important regional elections early next year. Conservative members of Parliament have been airing their criticism of Merkel with a vigor not seen since she took power in 2005.
Merkel, who is finding herself increasingly isolated in Europe as a whole over her refugee policies, faced an astonishing rebellion from within her Cabinet recently when two normally loyal Christian Democratic allies, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, thwarted her plans to allow refugees who arrived in Germany to bring their families in later. That could have tripled the numbers of refugees.
“Merkel’s going to face a lot of criticism at the party congress from people in the CDU with a lot of pent-up anger over the refugee situation, and there will be people looking to kick her in the shins,” said Richard Stoess, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “But at the end of the day, they all know that the party doesn’t have any alternative candidate to Merkel. There’s no one waiting in the wings.”
Since Merkel, 61, beat back a long line of once-powerful male rivals in the Christian Democratic Union earlier in her career after taking the party leadership in 2000, no one has dared to challenge her. She has led the Christian Democrats to three consecutive federal election victories since 2005. Though her plunging popularity has pushed the party down in opinion polls to about 38% from close to 42% earlier this year, the conservatives are still far ahead of their largest rival, the center-left Social Democrats, who are stuck at 25%.

A big concern for the Christian Democrats is the fast-growing far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has shot up to levels above 10% — mostly siphoning away voters from the Christian Democratic Union who are fed up with Merkel’s welcoming of refugees with her now-famous slogan: “Wir schaffen das” (We can do it). The conservatives are also in a pensive mood ahead of the three important state elections on March 16 — in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt — where the flood of refugees is the No. 1 issue.
“Merkel will have a big problem on her hands if CDU gets clobbered in March,” Stoess said of the Christian Democrats. “If she hasn’t got the refugee crisis under control by then and the CDU is weak, it’s going to be a different and far more difficult situation for her.”
Hans Vorlaender, a political scientist at the Technical University in Dresden, said the Christian Democratic Union tends to stick with its leaders more faithfully and through tough times more than any other party in Germany — as long as they’re winning state and federal elections. But party support can evaporate quickly if lots of delegates and party rank and file start losing their posts following lost elections. Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, lost the support of his Social Democratic Party after it lost control of most of Germany’s 16 states, costing thousands of party jobs before he lost his as well.
“The delegates are going to criticize her refugee policies but will try to do that without damaging Merkel,” Vorlaender said. “They know that she’s the only one who can win elections for them and will be hoping she’ll find a way to get the voters to rally around the CDU again by the next vote. They don’t have any interest in causing her lasting damage.”
Merkel refuses to bow to pressure from the right wing of her party to introduce an upper limit on the number of refugees, saying the country’s constitution has no such provisions.
Merkel has made small concessions to the conservatives by pushing for a European Union-wide response to the refugee crisis, blocking some refugee family reunifications and introducing some border controls.
That is not enough for many in her party. Armin Schuster is a member of Parliament for the Christian Democrats who was a federal police officer and border guard patrolling Germany’s frontiers for 29 years before switching to politics in 2009.
“It’s not acceptable that people are coming uncontrolled across Germany’s borders,” Schuster said. “A country has to be able to keep control of its borders. Politically, we’ve given that up far too easily. That’s not anyone’s idea of national security.”
Schuster said police estimate there could be as many as 200,000 to 300,000 undocumented and unregistered refugees in Germany now, far more than a year ago.
“It’s not all right that refugees are being housed in gymnasiums, in tent villages and in containers,” he said. “This can’t go on like this any longer.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-shulz-2017-story.html;2017-02-08;A plain-spoken German populist may have a shot at ousting Angela Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"He is a recovering alcoholic who dropped out of high school and spent most of his political career abroad.
So when Martin Schulz returned home to Germany with the goal of unseating Chancellor Angela Merkel, perhaps the world’s most powerful woman, it was understandably viewed as a suicide mission.
Merkel had made mincemeat out of the last three challengers from Schulz’s Social Democratic Party, and there was little doubt that she could do so again.
But in an era when voters worldwide seem prepared to throw off the establishment and take a chance with an untested populist, Schulz, a jovial former bookshop owner from Germany’s Rhineland region who until recently was president of the European Parliament, has quickly been embraced as a serious challenger.
In just two weeks since taking over his party’s leadership, Schulz has shattered the conventional wisdom that he and his party have no chance and has given the Social Democrats their first lead in polls over the conservatives since 2006.
After Britain’s unexpected vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s against-long-odds victory in the U.S. presidential election, the Social Democrats’ rally in opinion polls has raised serious doubts about whether Merkel can win a fourth term.
Her reelection was once seen so certain that even then-President Obama unexpectedly weighed in late last year, telling German voters on a visit to Berlin that if he could vote here, he would vote for Merkel. It was an unprecedented intervention on behalf of the conservative party leader — and an astonishing affront to the party that is Germany’s closest equivalent to Obama’s Democrats.

The German election is suddenly an open contest, according to opinion polls.
The Social Democratic Party (SPD), which last beat Merkel’s center-right party outright in 1998 and lost control of the government to her party in 2005, has surged eight percentage points to 31% in the last two weeks after years of stagnating just above 20%, according to a poll by the INSA institute for Bild newspaper. Meanwhile, the conservative bloc, consisting of Merkel’s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, fell from 33% to 30%.
“It’s caught everyone by surprise that Schulz was able to help the SPD make such a powerful break out of the doldrums they’d been trapped in for such a long time,” said Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at Goettingen University. “The lesson learned is that he has proven what was until recently not thought possible: that the right candidate on the left can unify the party and mobilize the masses.”

We’ve suffered for a long time in the polls, and now we’ve got something to cheer about.
— Martin Schulz
The Social Democrats’ sudden strength in polls is no guarantee of success in the Sept. 24 election, in which Merkel appears to have more coalition options. In Germany’s complex multi-party system, it will most likely take a two- or even-three party alliance to form the next government.
The Social Democrats would like to create a left-of-center government with the Greens and Left parties. Until recently, its only path to power was seen as being a junior partner in another “grand coalition” with Merkel’s party. Schulz’s surge has suddenly given his party a number of more palatable left-of-center options and even the chance to lead the next government.
“Schulz has managed to mobilize a lot of previously undecided voters and people on the left who had turned their backs on the SPD,” said Nils Diederich, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “There’s a lot of hope vested in Schulz right now. But I’m not sure yet if it’s just a lot of hype that will fade away by the election.”
In a country where frustration over professional politicians with fancy university degrees is growing, Schulz offers a more humble and straight-talking approach. He appears to be wooing back some supporters who abandoned the party 14 years ago when it agreed to tough, pro-business labor reforms and pension changes that hurt the working class.
“We’ve suffered for a long time in the polls, and now we’ve got something to cheer about,” Schulz told reporters on the campaign trail this week. “It confirms what we suspected all along, that people want an SPD government.”
Pollsters admit they were surprised by the scope of the party’s gains but aren’t sure whether they will last.
“Schulz is certainly attractive for the ‘little people’ because he understands what the working class voters are going through — they sense that he’s one of them,” said Peter Matuschek, a senior pollster at the Forsa institute in Berlin. “If you look at his resume, he’s one of them: no high school diploma and no degree.”
As a young man, Schulz had wanted to be a professional soccer player, but his career was cut short by injury, leading to his bout with alcohol in the 1970s. Matuschek said he doesn’t think that past will hurt him politically — on the contrary, it might help him among voters who see someone “who made it back after hitting rock bottom.” After he quit drinking, he became more and more involved in politics, becoming his town’s mayor at 31.
His unvarnished way of speaking has touched a nerve, especially among the country’s legions of working-class voters who had abandoned the Social Democrats in droves when the party’s last chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, pushed it from the left into the political center from 1998 to 2005.
“It’s time for a change,” said Miriam Dieter, a Berlin student. “The others talk a lot without saying anything. Schulz is different. He talks directly about what’s on people’s minds.”
In one talk show interview, Schulz deftly zeroed in on Merkel’s biggest weakness: her party ally Horst Seehofer, the leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, who has attacked her relentlessly for refusing to introduce an upper annual limit of 200,000 on the number of refugees coming into Germany.
The Social Democrats have generally taken a pro-refugee position while Merkel’s conservatives remain badly split on the issue: Merkel and her Christian Democrats (CDU) are for allowing in refugees while the Bavarian party is opposed.
Still, the question of refugees is not expected to play a major role in the campaign. Neither Merkel’s conservatives nor the Social Democrats have any interest in putting a spotlight on the arrival of more than 1 million people seeking asylum from wars and turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Polls show a shrinking majority of Germans continue to support Merkel’s policies of opening the country’s gates to refugees. But her position is far more controversial among conservatives than among Social Democrats .
“If the CDU and CSU continue to fight about the number of refugees and don’t get their act together on that fast, it will hurt them massively in the fall election,” said Matuschek at Forsa. “The SPD under Schulz have a unified position supporting refugees. The conservatives don’t.”

Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his government maintained Germany will continue to buy billions of dollars’ worth of natural gas and oil from Russia each week for the foreseeable future to keep German car companies and factories operating at full throttle, even though critics in Ukraine and the West argue that the $220 million Germany sends to Moscow every day for Russian energy is being used, at least indirectly, to finance its war against Ukraine.
“We are pursuing a strategy that will make us independent of Russian gas, coal and oil, but just not right away,” Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy and energy minister, said Sunday evening in an interview on German television. Two hours later, the leader of Scholz’s Social Democratic Party amplified the sentiment.
“An immediate embargo of Russian natural gas would be the wrong way to go,” Lars Klingbeil told another German TV talk show.
Germany relies on Russian energy for half of its energy needs.
In addition to criticism from the United States and Ukraine, others this week, including Poland, lashed out at Germany for not assuming its share of the economic burden.
In an interview published in Germany’s Welt Sunday newspaper, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party, demanded that Germany stop buying oil and natural gas from Russia.
World & Nation
The proposed ban on coal imports would be the first EU sanctions to target Russia’s lucrative energy industry over Moscow’s war against Ukraine.

“You can’t constantly support a great power like Russia with billions in payments from the purchase of energy,” said Kaczynski. “This is inadmissible from a political and moral point of view. This must come to an end, and Germany should finally take a clear stance on this.”

The steadfast refusal to ban Russian oil and natural gas imports has become particularly awkward for Germany — Europe’s economic powerhouse — following allegations by Ukraine of genocide in Bucha, after Russian forces retreated from that city. Because of the shame of the Holocaust and its Nazi past, Germany’s action — or inaction — when it concerns moral leadership in a time of crisis comes under special scrutiny across Europe.
Germany, which has a  yearning for peaceful resolutions to conflicts in part as a reaction to its war-filled 20th century past, faced widespread criticism before the war started for initially refusing to send any defensive weapons to Ukraine as a Russian invasion loomed, and because it also blocked the transfer of German-made weapons from other NATO members to Ukraine. Germany also faced criticism because it initially opposed cutting Russian banks off from the SWIFT global banking network.
Lithuania announced Sunday that it has banned Russian energy imports while Poland and Slovakia, among others, have called for speedy action. The German government’s business-like explanations that it cannot possibly stop importing Russian energy until later this year — because an embargo would risk sending its economy into recession — have resonated across Europe. The United States said in early March it had stopped all Russian oil and energy imports in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

While Scholz’s government says it cannot afford an immediate cutoff of Russian oil and natural gas, others within Germany differ.
“We’ve got to stop financing Putin’s war,” said Marieluise Beck, directing her comments at leaders of her Greens party and the ruling Social Democrats, shortly after returning from a trip to Kyiv. “Ukraine doesn’t have much time left. We’ve got to take another look at how much [economic pain] we can handle ourselves.”
Others in the ranks of the Greens party have also called for an immediate embargo.
The renewed foot-dragging on tougher sanctions against Russia by Germany threatens to further embarrass the country that had long been deepening business ties with Russia, even after its 2014 annexation of  Crimea.
An earlier German government in which Scholz’s Social Democrats served approved a business deal with Russia in 2015 — just a year after the Crimea takeover — to double the amount of Russian gas imported through a new Nord Stream 2 pipeline that was completed last year. The pipeline was designed, critics say, to circumvent Ukraine and rob it of billions of dollars in annual transit fees.
World & Nation
Rescue efforts continued Monday outside Kyiv as Biden and European leaders called for swift action against Russia for civilian deaths.

“For the whole world and especially Germany, the message has to be clear — don’t give Russia another cent because it’s blood money that’s being used to butcher people,” said Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko in an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper on Monday. “We need an immediate embargo on all oil and natural gas from Russia.”
Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, said the alleged massacres uncovered in Bucha only reinforced the need for Germany to take on a leadership role in standing up to Russia rather than focus on German-Russian business ties and its own economy.
“I hope this massacre will serve as a red line for the German government so that it finally starts to act,” Melnyk said. “That means an immediate embargo on oil, natural gas, coal and metals. I don’t understand how anyone in Germany can sleep at night after seeing horrors like this without doing anything about it. What’s it going to take for Germany to act with tougher sanctions? A chemical weapons attack? What are they waiting for?”
Scholz had bristled at a suggestion last week during a German TV interview by leading independent economists that an immediate embargo on Russian gas would only slow, but not cripple, the German economy. “They’ve got that all wrong,” Scholz said sharply. “It’s irresponsible to calculate some kind of mathematic model like that.”
The German chancellor, noting large numbers of jobs were at stake, added: “If we were to suddenly stop importing natural gas [from Russia], that would mean entire industrial sectors would have to shut down.”
Instead of banning Russian gas, German government leaders are mulling plans to conserve energy, such as introducing maximum speed limits on its high-speed freeways, prolonging the use of its last three nuclear power plants that were scheduled to be mothballed this year, and increasing its use of coal-burning power plants.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has been a frequent target of sharp criticism from Ukraine and its ambassador for being a champion of business ties with Russia as a way to secure peace in Europe. Steinmeier, a former foreign minister, acknowledged Monday that he had been wrong about Russia.
“We were clinging to the idea of building bridges to Russia that our partners warned us about,” Steinmeier said, in particular apologizing for his support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that the United States and most of Europe warned Germany against because it increased German dependence on Russian natural gas.  “We failed to build a common Europe. We failed to incorporate Russia in our security architecture…. I was wrong.”
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized former Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a speech on Sunday, inviting them to Bucha to see firsthand what happens after 14 years of concessions to Russia and leading opposition to Ukraine’s bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization despite support for Kyiv’s bid by President George W. Bush.
“Former Chancellor Angela Merkel stands by her decision at the NATO summit in 2008 in Bucharest,” a spokesman for Merkel said, referring to her opposition to Ukraine’s bid.

https://www.latimes.com/nation/sns-bc-eu--germany-merkels-moment-20150913-story.html;2015-09-13;Migrant crisis adjusts Merkel's image, but style unchanged - Los Angeles Times;"In the space of two months, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone from being portrayed as the heartless villain in Europe’s debt crisis to the heroine of those flooding in to find refuge on the continent.
But while different crises have triggered contrasting perceptions of the German leader, Merkel’s behavior has appeared consistent: a first-unhurried, then decisive approach to the challenge; an insistence that Europe must abide by international rules; an eye on public opinion at home; and hope that German leadership will help bring about a European solution.
Merkel hasn’t pleased everyone in Europe with her approach to either crisis. Several countries that backed her insistence on tough conditions for Greece’s new bailout, such as the Baltic nations and Slovakia, are now on the other side of the argument over whether to welcome refugees to Europe.
But the 61-year-old is undaunted, and her enduring domestic popularity is holding up as she approaches her 10th anniversary in office in November. That longevity has been based partly on her knack for convincing Germans that she is on top of complicated crises and taking account of their worries — something that has earned her the nickname “Mutti,” or “Mom.”
Her insistence that Germany and its fellow members in the 28-nation European Union all have a duty to shelter people fleeing civil wars has cemented something similar among hopeful migrants.
Some have held aloft pictures of Merkel, and she was greeted with applause and cheers at a Berlin refugee home Thursday. It remains to be seen how far that adulation holds up after the government announced Sunday that it was introducing border checks to limit the influx.
A hallmark of Merkel’s policy has always been pragmatism, rather than pathos or vision. The change in perceptions doesn’t mean a change in Merkel’s approach, said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency.
“I think she is acting very pragmatically, as ever — the stream of refugees is there, and she is trying to get a grip on it,” he said.

“She is, as always, flying by sight, taking one step after another,” he added, and believes that those fleeing violence in their homelands must be helped “so that a negative picture of Germany does not arise.”
Asked this week how she feels about the shift in perceptions of her abroad, Merkel said she was “glad Germany has become a country that many people outside Germany associate with hope.”
""(But) I don’t imagine that this is just about me — this is about the country, the people here, the many who stand at stations and the many who welcome (asylum seekers),” she said.
Merkel has pointed to the possible benefits for prosperous Germany, with its shrinking population, of integrating newcomers: “If we do it well, it carries more opportunities than risks.” She has said there will be “no tolerance” for “parallel societies” of newcomers who reject integration, and encouraged women who arrive to learn German along with their children.
Germany’s insistence on the paramount importance of EU countries sticking to the rules has irked many during the debt crisis.
And in some ways, that approach is reflected in the migrant crisis. Merkel has rejected Hungary’s assertion that it is a purely German problem by noting that the Geneva Convention on protecting refugees applies to every EU nation.
“Germany is doing what is morally and legally necessary, no more and no less,” she asserted.
Her government has rejected accusations from others that Germany itself is flouting EU rules by deciding not to send Syrian refugees back to the first EU country they entered. And it is taking a persistent approach to trying to persuade deeply reluctant countries elsewhere in Europe to share the burden of taking in the newcomers.
“We see time and again that there are challenges in Europe in which it comes down to us in particular ... to Germany’s strength,” Merkel told lawmakers Wednesday in an unusually open acknowledgement of Germany’s position as Europe’s political leader.
“It is more likely that we will find a European solution if we are courageous and sometimes lead the way,” she said.
Merkel drew criticism at home over the summer for initially hesitating to address the migrant crisis, while many ordinary Germans pitched in to help refugees and concerns mounted over attacks on refugee accommodations. That played into a longstanding pattern of Merkel appearing to sit out contentious issues until she has read the political mood.
She initially left the field to her interior minister and vice chancellor before taking the plunge by visiting a refugee shelter in the eastern town of Heidenau, where a far-right mob had hurled bottles and fireworks at police.
Since then, Merkel has made the issue her own, agreeing earlier this month to let in thousands of migrants who had piled up in Hungary — something that her government insisted was a one-time measure to ease an emergency.
The influx showed no sign of abating in the subsequent week. Still, Merkel has the luxury of governing in a coalition of Germany’s biggest parties with a huge parliamentary majority and a liberally minded left-wing opposition.
The only significant public criticism of her decision to take in migrants from Hungary came from the Christian Social Union, the often-awkward socially conservative Bavarian sister to her own party, which said the move was a mistake. Merkel felt able to dismiss that criticism, saying she was “convinced that it was right.”
On Sunday, with accommodation for new arrivals stretched thin, Merkel’s government said it was introducing border checks on the Austrian frontier in an effort to limit the influx — and also increase the pressure on other EU countries to help share the burden. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that Germany’s readiness to help “must not be overstretched.”
In the same way she insisted the Greek debt crisis would not be solved overnight, Merkel is preparing Germans for the long haul in dealing with the flood of refugees. She stresses there is no legal limit to the number of people fleeing persecution who have a right to asylum, but that those who have no such claim must return home quickly — in particular the many people coming in from the Balkan countries.
“This will be a central challenge, not just for days or months, but as far as we can see for a long time,” Merkel said recently. “So it is important to say that German thoroughness is great, but now we need German flexibility.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-elected-party-leader-20161206-story.html;2016-12-06;German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls for ban on full-face veils and for fewer migrants  - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she knows her push for a fourth term in office will be her toughest campaign yet.
On Tuesday, in a distinct nod to voter angst over an enormous influx of mainly Muslim migrants, the 62-year-old leader for the first time endorsed legal restrictions on face-covering veils in public.
“Here, we show our faces, so full veiling is not appropriate,” the chancellor declared in a policy speech to a party congress that was greeted with sustained applause.
Merkel said bans on coverings such as the burqa and niqab should be enacted “wherever it is legally possible” — measures that would probably include venues such as courtrooms, public schools and universities, together with occasions such as traffic stops and police checks.
It’s not a complete about-face for the German leader, who has suggested that full facial coverings, worn by some observant Muslim women, are not compatible with German cultural norms.
But her stated willingness to support legal bans was a highly symbolic moment, representing perhaps her most explicit acknowledgement to date that allowing entry of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers over the last two years had opened deep fault lines within German society.
Merkel’s comments brought her more in line with growing sentiment elsewhere in Europe where mainstream leaders have been facing a populist challenge that is often colored by anti-migrant sentiment.
Garments associated with observant Islam have been a cultural flashpoint in places like France, where a “burkini” controversy erupted during the summer when a string of municipalities moved to prohibit full-body swimwear, with some defying a court ruling against the bans.

In France, debate about national identity and cultural assimilation was galvanized by a series of large-scale terrorist attacks. Germany has been largely unscathed by such jihadist strikes, but Merkel’s once-unassailable popularity fell significantly amid the migration crisis, providing a political opening for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which is considered likely to gain a parliamentary foothold next year.
As recently as late summer, Merkel was still voicing the watchwords first associated with the enormous migrant flood of 2015: “We will manage.” She has since dropped that catchphrase from her political lexicon and promised — as she did again Tuesday when speaking to the gathering of her Christian Democratic Union — that there would be no repeat of such a large-scale influx.
Merkel’s decision last month to seek another term — coming after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory and Britain’s June vote to exit the European Union — has prompted some to cast her as the principal remaining champion of liberal democratic values.
She demurs in taking that role but presents herself as a source of stability amid an increasingly volatile political landscape — a world, she said in her speech, that many now see as being “in disarray.”
Merkel also made an unusually frank reference to Trump, on whom she had refrained from commenting while he was in the midst of the presidential campaign — acknowledging that change probably lay ahead for a long-standing global order. Trump has questioned the main founding principle of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, suggesting during the campaign that some member states might not be militarily defended.
“We are faced with a world, especially after the U.S. election, that needs to reorder itself, with regard to NATO and the relationship with Russia,” she said.
If Germany moves ahead with restrictions on public wearing of veils, it will join France, which for years has had the most comprehensive ban in Europe, and Belgium, with the Netherlands weighing similar measures.
The prohibitions are commonly described as burqa bans, although that garment covers the entire body as well as the face — a mesh covering the eyes with the rest of the face concealed. Face coverings known as niqab have a slit for eyes.
Restrictions on full-face veils, though worn by few Muslim women in the West, are often defended on security grounds, because a wearer’s identity cannot be easily ascertained. Such legal prohibitions sometimes include other types of concealing headgear, such as ski masks and motorcycle helmets.
Merkel, though, did not shy away from placing face coverings in a religious context and characterizing them as an impediment to assimilation.
“Our law takes precedence over honor codes, tribal or family rules and over sharia law,” she said. “That has to be spelled out clearly.”
Merkel’s gesture comes as centrist parties like hers in neighboring countries are gearing up for tough election fights. Like Germany, France and the Netherlands will hold elections next year, and far-right parties in all three countries have seen an increase in popularity.
The weekend defeat in Austria of a presidential contender from a far-right party whose founders had Nazi roots brought a sigh of relief in many quarters, but commentators pointed out that Norbert Hofer’s loss was relatively narrow, with the final tally likely to separate him from victor Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the center-left Green Party, by about 5 or 6 percentage points, perhaps less.
As expected, Christian Democratic delegates overwhelmingly voted to reelect Merkel as their party leader, but by a smaller margin than the last leadership vote, which was nearly unanimous. If her party prevails in next fall’s parliamentary voting and she serves out a fourth four-year term, she would become only the third postwar German chancellor to do so.

10:45 p.m.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany’s 16 state governors have agreed on measures designed to streamline the country’s handling of the migrant influx — including declaring three Balkan countries “safe” states of origin and cutting some cash payments to newcomers.
Merkel said Thursday that Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro will be declared safe countries as part of efforts to reduce the stream of people from those countries who have arrived. The agreement calls for “pocket money” paid to people at initial reception centers to be switched to benefits in kind.
The federal government is pledging to shoulder many of the financial risks of the influx, relieving state and municipal authorities. And the deal would enable making exceptions to cumbersome construction planning rules.
The package will take effect Nov. 1.

6:15 p.m.
The head of the U.N. refugee agency says he is “disappointed” that a European Union plan to help those pouring into Europe failed to open more legal pathways for them to enter.
Antonio Guterres generally welcomed EU plans to relocate 120,000 refugees and boost humanitarian aid for the neighbors of war-torn Syria — the home of most of the refugees who have poured into Greece via Turkey in recent months.
Guterres said Thursday that more needs to be done to improve the facilities to take in, help, register and screen people now arriving by boat at an average rate of 5,000 a day.
His office called the EU program “limited” compared to current needs and urged a “substantial and rapid increase in legal opportunities for refugees to access the EU.”

6:05 p.m.
Hundreds of Syrian refugees who have waited more than a week at the border between Greece and Turkey in hopes of getting into the European Union are being returned to other areas in Turkey.
The movement was reported Thursday by Turkey’s country’s state-run Anadolu Agency. The failure to win admission into the EU is a disappointment for those who had gathered at the Turkish border city of Edirne since Sept. 15 in hopes of avoiding the dangerous sea crossing to Greece.
Some refugees had hoped Wednesday’s meeting in Brussels would come up with a deal that would allow them into Greece or Bulgaria.
Anadolu said the refugees would be returned to the provinces where they registered.

About 500 migrants have been stranded at a Christian Orthodox cemetery in no man’s land between Serbia and Croatia.
Croatian police on Thursday blocked their entry from Serbia near the Tovarnik border crossing, which has been one of the main entry points for migrants as they seek to continue their hazardous journey toward Western Europe.
The influx of mainly Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans has caused tensions between Balkan rivals Serbia and Croatia, with countries criticizing each other over border closures and traffic blockades.
Croatia is blaming Serbia for busing migrants to the Croatian border, instead of channeling them further north toward Hungary.
___
3:25 p.m.
Hungarian troops have started laying down spools of razor wire at a new border — this time, a crossing with Slovenia.
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told The Associated Press on Thursday that the razor wire was being installed near a checkpoint between the Hungarian village of Tornyiszentmiklos and Pince, Slovenia.
State television showed soldiers in thick protective gloves installing the razor wire across hundreds of meters (yards) on the Slovenian border.
Kovacs called it a precautionary measure. But both Hungary and Slovenia are part of the European Union’s Schengen zone of passport-free travel, so, theoretically at least, there’s no need for border checks or fences between them.
Hungary has already built a 4-meter (13-feet) high fence on its border with Serbia and hopes to finish a similar barrier on the Croatian border shortly. Preparations are also underway to extend the fence along the Romanian border as well.
The fence has succeeded in stopping most migrants from entering Hungary from Serbia but over 10,000 entered Hungary from Croatia on Wednesday.

2:55 p.m.
Croatian police say more than 51,000 migrants have entered the country since they first started arriving more than a week ago.
Police say 3,500 people crossed Thursday morning into Croatia from Serbia around Tovarnik, where migrants have been coming in through nearby cornfields.
The influx has caused tensions between the Balkan rivals, with countries slamming each other with border closures and traffic blockades. The migrants began entering Croatia after Hungary closed its border on Sept. 15.
Croatia says it’s so overwhelmed that authorities have been shipping the migrants toward Hungary or Slovenia. Most want to travel on to wealthier nations in Western Europe such as Germany or Sweden.

Serbia’s prime minister says Serbia “will not respond to the latest Croatian sanctions,” which he called “maddening.”
Serbia has banned imports of Croatian goods and Croatia has retaliated by barring vehicles with Serbian license plates from entering as relations between the two longtime Balkan rivals deteriorate over the huge influx of migrants over their border.
Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic says the financial losses will be big on both sides, and adds he thinks the sanctions won’t last long. He says if they do, “we will have to replace some of the Croatian goods with ones from Serbia and other countries.”
Serbian companies send a lot of goods to other European nations through Croatia.
Croatia for its part is angry that Serbia is busing migrants to its border rather than sending them north to Hungary. Nearly 45,000 have entered in the last week.

Norway’s domestic intelligence agency says the influx of migrants has a consequence for the general threat assessment in the country, mainly in the potential for a backlash.
More than 2,800 people, mainly Syrians, have sought shelter in Norway so far in Norway in September.
Siv Alsen of the PST security police says there is a potential that left-wing groups rallying to support refugee-related cases and “can lead to counter-reactions and violent clashes” with right-wing extremists.
In Thursday’s statement, Alsen said asylum-seekers linked to radical Islamism are “not a central concern” in the short term, adding the main threat comes primarily from people born or raised in Norway.
The country expects to receive up to 20,000 asylum-seekers this year, compared to 11,480 people in 2014.

French officials say a teenage migrant from east Africa was struck and killed by a freight train as he tried to make the dangerous crossing from northern France to Britain through the Channel Tunnel.
The Calais prefecture’s office said the man’s body was discovered around 2 a.m. Thursday by rescue workers near the tracks. Eurotunnel, which operates the freight service, also confirmed the death in the French terminal area.
About a dozen migrants have died since this summer in Calais, where they are camped in hopes of reaching a better life in Britain. Britain and France have reinforced security at the entrance of the Tunnel linking the two countries after a series of attempts to rush the site en masse.

11:10 a.m.
More than 10,000 refugees and other migrants have entered Hungary in a single day, the highest figure this year, as Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he was willing to consider letting people through to Western Europe.
Police said Thursday that 10,046 people arrived in Hungary the day before, surpassing the previous mark of 9,380 set Sept. 14, just before Hungary closed down its border with Serbia.
While nearly all the migrants are now taking a detour and entering from Croatia, Hungary is also building a fence on that border which Orban said would be ready by the weekend.
Early Thursday, however, after a meeting of EU national leaders in Brussels, Orban said Hungary would consider giving the migrants free passage toward Austria and Germany, where many want to go.
Orban cited Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, who “clearly said that if we can only stop them with the fence, then we should rather let them through. This is what must be considered.”

9:05 a.m.
The governors of Germany’s 16 states are in Berlin to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks on how to manage the influx of migrants to the country.
Over the past year Germany has received hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and others fleeing war and poverty.
But the huge number of people needing food and shelter has strained even the resources of Europe’s biggest economy.
The meeting Thursday in Berlin is aimed at improving cooperation between national and local authorities, and speeding up the bureaucratic process of asylum claims.

8:55 a.m.
Serbia has banned imports of Croatian goods and Croatia has retaliated by barring vehicles with Serbian license plates from entering the country as relations between the two Balkan neighbors deteriorated over the influx of migrants over their border.
Serbia had given Croatia an ultimatum to reopen its border for all cargo transport by midnight, which Croatia has been blocking since last week.
Croatia’s police said Serbian nationals were not let into Croatia early Thursday because of “a problem” with the border information site.
Croatia shut all but one of its crossings with Serbia to block the migrant surge, which reached nearly 45,000 in a week. Croatia is angry that Serbia is busing migrants to its border, rather than sending them north to Hungary.
Croatia’s action has crippled the economy in Serbia, a conduit for cargo across Croatia to western and central Europe.

Romania’s president says his country will give 300,000 euros ($336,000) in the next three years to the World Food Program to help relief agencies offer food and shelter to people fleeing conflicts.
President Klaus Iohannis spoke early Thursday after an emergency European Union summit to discuss ways of tackling the migration crisis. At the meeting leaders agreed to give an extra 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to the United Nations refugee agency and World Food program to help refugees.

Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel tried to calm the brewing storm by insisting it was unfair to blame all refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq for a single criminal act, but the fallout from the slaying of 19-year-old Maria Ladenburger nonetheless left the government on the defensive.
For the record:
7:30 p.m. Aug. 22, 2019An earlier version of this article referred to a close party ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel as Julie Kloeckner. She is Julia Kloeckner.
Merkel allies warned the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has become a powerful new political force on the far right, against trying to use the case to score political points as the September 2017 election campaign is getting underway.
That didn’t stop AfD co-leader Joerg Meuthen from bluntly blaming Merkel and Gabriel, saying they deserved “a major share of the responsibility” for the killing.
Opponents of Merkel and her refugee policies also attacked the nation’s most popular news broadcaster, ARD’s flagship Tagesschau program, watched by some 10 million viewers, for opting initially not to cover the arrest on the grounds that it was a regional, not national, issue.
Newspapers across Germany reported a high volume of critical comments about refugees and the media from users, and Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in Berlin said that 40% of the user comments submitted were not suitable for publication—four times the usual number of comments that did not meet its decency standards.
“We cannot allow this abominable act to be abused for rabble-rousing and conspiracy theories,” Gabriel said on Facebook. “Everyone is aware that a horrible crime can be committed by a refugee just as it can be by someone born in Germany. There were also horrific crimes long before any refugees had arrived from Afghanistan or Syria.”
Merkel, who recently announced plans to run for a fourth term in September, has seen her popularity plunge in the last year in large part due to her staunch refusal to accept demands from her party’s right wing to limit migrants entering the country to 200,000 per year.

She did not comment on the slaying in Freiburg and has remained determined to keep Germany open to refugees. She drew criticism from her party for shaking hands with a number of young refugees from Afghanistan and elsewhere at regional party meetings in recent weeks.
Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters on Monday: “The assailant must be punished with the full force of the law. But we shouldn’t forget that we’re talking about the possible act of one Afghan refugee—not entire groups of Afghanis or refugees.”
A close Merkel ally in her conservative Christian Democrat party, Julia Kloeckner, also said it was wrong to blame all refugees: “An atrocity like this can be committed by a German or a foreigner,” she said. “You can’t see what’s in anyone’s head.”
The killing in Freiburg, a bucolic university town of 220,000 on the rim of the Black Forest near Switzerland and France, also reignited public fears of the perils of allowing so many refugees fleeing war, turmoil and poverty into the normally tightly controlled country with at best cursory checks over the last 15 months.
Germany has been hit with three relatively minor incidents this year involving migrants: a knife attack against a police officer, an ax attack against tourists on a train and a bungled suicide bombing in which only the attacker from Syria was killed.
Fears linger over incidents of sexual abuse of women and groping attacks by foreign men on New Year’s Eve in Cologne and dozens of other cities.
“This crime will only confirm the fears that a lot of people in Germany have that they’re not safe anymore in their own country,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “All the elements of fear are on hand: once again, it was violence against a woman; once again, it was a crime by a refugee; and once again, the country’s most important news show didn’t report it. It only seemed to confirm the worst suspicions of some that the mainstream media don’t want to report disagreeable kinds of stories about refugees.”
Foreign diplomats, party officials and political scientists have warned that any sharp upturn in crimes by refugees or their involvement in a major terror attack could severely damage if not destroy Merkel’s reelection hopes.
The killing of Ladenburger, whose father, Clemens Ladenburger, is a top-ranking German official working for the European Commission in Brussels, had been in the national news for several weeks after her body was found in the Dreisam River in Freiburg on Oct. 18. She was a top student and had volunteered as a worker in her spare time at a refugee shelter near her dormitory.
She was attacked while riding her bike home from a university party about 2:30 a.m., police said. They said they found DNA evidence, on a strand of hair and a black scarf, linking the suspected killer to the scene after weeks of work at the crime scene.
The suspect was not named by authorities because he is a juvenile.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel says that there’s no legal limit to the number of people fleeing political persecution her country can shelter — and also making clear anew that people who aren’t entitled to asylum must return home quickly.
Germany has seen more migrants arrive than any other European country and expects 800,000 to come this year.
Asked in an interview with the daily Rheinische Post how many refugees per year it can accommodate, Merkel replied that she can’t give a simple figure. She said: “The fundamental right to asylum for the politically persecuted knows no upper limit; that also goes for refugees who come to us from the hell of a civil war.”
But she also noted that many people from “safe” Balkan countries are coming and said they must go home quickly if they have no grounds for asylum, which almost all don’t.

The Mexican government says it is studying the possibility of accepting refugees from Syria, where war has sent millions fleeing.
Mexico’s foreign relations secretary suggested Thursday the analysis is still at an early stage.
Claudia Ruiz Massieu said Mexico hasn’t determined how many refugees it might accept.

Ruiz Massieu said “we are following this and working on studying the possibility of accepting some refugees at some point.”
Venezuela has offered to accept 20,000 Syrians, and the United States 10,000.

As tens of thousands of Syrians are desperately fleeing their homeland, at least five Syrian families are eager to leave a country that gave them shelter.
Uruguay’s president says his administration will try to help the families reach another country.
Uruguay welcomed the 42 refugees fleeing Syria’s civil war in October 2014. But they protested this week outside the presidency, demanding authorities help them leave for other countries, saying Uruguay is too expensive.
President Tabare Vazquez said Thursday that Uruguay has reached out to Lebanon because that’s where the refugees would like to go. Since Lebanon is not willing to welcome them, his government is asking the five families to choose another country.
The refugees lack passports from their home country, and cannot get Uruguayan ones because they are not citizens. Uruguay has provided them with local IDs and travel documents, but not all countries recognize them.

The White House says President Barack Obama has told advisers he wants to let 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. in the coming budget year.
The U.S. has accepted only about 1,500 Syrians since civil war broke out more than four years ago.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest says about $4 billion the administration has provided to relief agencies and others is the most effective way for the U.S. to help meet the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Tens of thousands of people from the Middle East and other war-torn countries are seeking safe haven across Europe.
But Earnest says Obama has decided that admitting more Syrian refugees would help boost the U.S. response.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says the United States should increase the number of refugees it resettles by more than 5,000 people next year as European countries struggle to accommodate the hundreds of thousands flocking in from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Pelosi said a figure of 5,000 more refugees suggested by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry “is far too low.” Kerry told members of Congress in a meeting Wednesday that the U.S. will boost its worldwide quota for resettling refugees from 70,000 to 75,000 next year, adding that the number could rise. A fraction of those would be from Syria.
Pelosi said the U.S. accepted far more refugees than that after the Vietnam War and could do so again. She said she hopes other countries follow Germany’s lead in accepting many refugees.

Turkey’s prime minister says his country and the European Union should unite in tackling the migration crisis that has overwhelmed the region.
Speaking jointly following a meeting Thursday in Ankara, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, stressed the need to keep working together to tackle problems created by the migrant crisis.
Turkey is already hosting at least 1.9 million Syrians fleeing the war at home.
“These will be difficult choices, but our starting point is clear,” Tusk said. “Solidarity and unity are our guiding principles. In combination with measures to contain the refugee flows, and the measures to get back the control of our borders from those profiting from desperation — I mean smugglers and human traffickers.”

Prosecutors in Hungary have ordered police to investigate a camerawoman caught on video kicking and tripping migrants near the border with Serbia.
Chief Prosecutor Zsolt Kopasz said they suspect the camerawoman identified in Hungarian media as Petra Laszlo of disorderly conduct and that authorities in the southern city of Szeged are also considering more serious crimes in the case.
After several videos surfaced showing Laszlo kicking a young man and a girl, as well as sticking her leg out to trip a man running past with a young boy in his arms, she was dismissed from her job at N1TV, an Internet channel associated with Hungary’s far-right Jobbik party.
The migrants were running from police to avoid being fingerprinted.

The European Council on Refugees and Exiles says five EU countries are handling 70 percent or more of those seeking asylum in Europe — Germany, France, Hungary, Italy and Sweden.
Minos Mouzourakis from the council says “this was the case in 2014, and these discrepancies and inequalities in distribution have been exacerbated this year.”
Germany alone received nearly 180,000 asylum applications — “nearly the number that it had received for the whole of the previous year.”
The organization found that more than 380,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe by crossing the Mediterranean this year, and more than 258,000 of them landed in Greece.

An Iraqi refugee who captured the world’s attention after being pictured weeping as he arrived on a Greek island last month, clutching his son and daughter, is now in Berlin and looking to start a new life.
Laith Majid said Thursday he’s been overwhelmed by the reception his family has received in Germany. “People know the meaning of love,” he said as his daughter Nour, 7, and son Taha, 9, blew soap bubbles.
Majid, also accompanied by his wife and two older boys, says they’re now looking to move on with their lives.
“We came out from death and I thank Allah for the life we are in now,” he said.

Volunteers helping migrants in Hungary say conditions are a “disaster” at the border with Serbia.
Kathrin Niedermoser, a volunteer with an Austrian aid group, said Thursday “the situation here is really a big disaster, because a lot of refugees are coming every hour. We don’t have real infrastructure here.”
She says “there are no big tents where people can come, sleep, have a rest. We don’t even have electricity, which means we don’t have warm water.”
Gabor Gyurko, tending to migrants at a tent run by the Catholic charity Caritas, worried about the bad weather and “the number of sick people who are going to arrive in the next few days.” Torrential rains hit the area Thursday.
The Hungarian government, meanwhile, offered to assist the Hungarian Red Cross and other groups to improve conditions at the border.

At Budapest’s embattled Keleti train station, migrants hoping to travel to Austria or Germany are facing a chaotic quest.
Two dozen police in surgical masks and gloves have blocked access to train platforms for more than 400 refugees and migrants holding tickets to Vienna. Police are escorting non-migrant passengers to trains directly beside migrants, who are supposed to stay on one side of the police tape. About 50 migrants were permitted on one train to Gyor.
Many of the migrants have waited 8-10 hours to board a train. Some had slept overnight in a Budapest park after traveling in the previous night from Roszke, at the Hungarian border.
A Migration Aid official with a bullhorn at Keleti is trying to keep order. But word is trickling out that the migrants may get stuck at the Austrian border because the Austrian railway company has suspended trains to and from Hungary due to a “massive overload.”

Hungary’s armed forces are taking part in exercises near the country’s border with Serbia to prepare soldiers to assist police with controlling the huge flow of migrants reaching the country.
Defense Minister Istvan Simicsko said Thursday that around 2,000 soldiers are being trained near the southern cities of Baja and Hodmezovasarhely to help police.
The Hungarian Parliament is expected to approve legislation on Sept. 22 authorizing the army to help police at the border, where 2,000 soldiers are already working on the construction of a 4-meter (13-feet) high fence to stop migrants from walking in from Serbia.
Police say more than 176,000 migrants have entered Hungary so far this year, over four times as many as in 2014.

Denmark’s decision to let migrants and refugees travel through the country to get to Sweden and other Nordic countries is getting a cool reception in Sweden.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said all countries need to follow EU asylum rules “and that means all countries must register refugees. That’s what the Danish government has said before and we assume that all countries follow the rules we have.”
In the Danish port city of Roedby, one of the two main crossings from Germany, migrants were seen being picked up by people in private cars. It was unclear where they were going.
The Danish railway company DSB said some train service between Germany and Denmark resumed Thursday after being suspended the day before.

Austrian railways is suspending all traffic between Hungary and Austria as migrants continue to flow over the border.
A statement from the company says Thursday’s move is due to “massive overload.”
The statement says trains will continue to run from Nickelsdorf to Vienna. Nickelsdorf, the main border crossing into Austria from Hungary, has been the point of entry for most of the thousands of migrants and refugees leaving Hungary and continuing into Germany and other Western European EU countries.
Thousands more have sought to get on to trains leaving the Hungarian capital, Budapest, for Vienna.

Torrential rain has turned the Macedonian border into a sea of mud — the latest trial facing those on the 1,000 mile-plus trek into Europe.
At least 7,000 people, including many parents lugging young children, braved downpours and muddy fields Thursday to cross Greece’s northern border into Macedonia. Greek border police said was the largest single wave of refugees and migrants they had seen so far.
Despite wrapping themselves up in garbage bags of every kind, the migrants, many of them fleeing the war in Syria, were soaked to the skin. Their sneakers were caked with mud, their hats and hoods dripping with rain. Two men lifted a white-haired man, helping him step by step. Some parents raised their children high in the air so Macedonian police would let them through the checkpoints first.
By early afternoon, all had crossed but thousands more were on their way, heading to the Greek mainland in ferries from the country’s overcrowded eastern islands.

The European Parliament has backed the plan of EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to spread out 160,000 refugees in Hungary, Greece and Italy across the other member states.
The support of the legislature had been expected and has little impact compared with the power of the member states, which also need to back the plan.
EU ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting on the issue next Monday and several eastern EU nations have already voiced their opposition to a mandatory spreading of refugees to their countries.

Romania’s president says there is “no way” his country will accept the extra number of migrants the European Commission has proposed.
Romania has been asked to accept 6,351 people. Leaders say that’s too much after they initially agreed to accept some 1,785.
President Klaus Iohannis said Romania will send its interior minister to a special meeting Monday in Brussels to discuss the issue.
“I had a discussion with him today and his mandate is to declare that there is no way Romania will agree to the obligatory quotas.”
Iohannis said the EU is seeking to distribute migrants in a bureaucratic way without consulting member states.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has visited a home for refugees in Berlin and says she hopes that the integration of newcomers will be helped by their children learning German in school.
Merkel’s brief visit Thursday to a refugee home in the suburb of Spandau came as Germany contemplates the task of absorbing the influx of refugees from Syria and elsewhere.
Merkel told reporters after her closed-doors visit that she spoke with two refugee families, one of them with two children now attending a kindergarten. She said: “Their integration will certainly take place in part via the children, who will learn German very quickly in kindergarten. And I hope and believe that the great majority will want to learn our language very quickly.”

Hungarian police are rejecting allegations that they mistreat migrants, as a record high of more than 3,300 entered the country in just one day.
Police said Thursday around 1,000 officers were on duty on the border with Serbia, where 3,321 migrants had been detained Wednesday.
Spokeswoman Viktoria Csiszer-Kovacs said migrants at police-run points near the border with Serbia and at registration centers are being given provisions and medical attention. She called allegations of abuse “blatant lies,” saying “illegal migrants are being looked after regularly and constantly.”
A day earlier, Peter Brouckaert from Human Rights Watch had described “horrific” conditions for migrants in Hungary, calling it “unacceptable that people are being treated like animals on the doorstep of Europe.”

Germany’s vice chancellor says a new European Union plan to relocate 160,000 refugees around Europe is a good “first step” but the numbers show clearly more is needed.
Sigmar Gabriel told Parliament in Berlin on Thursday that Germany had registered some 450,000 migrants this year, including 105,000 in August and 37,000 in September through Tuesday.
“That shows that the redistribution of 160,000 refugees in Europe is a first step,” Gabriel said. “One could also say a drop in the ocean that won’t solve everything.”
The EU proposed Wednesday in Brussels to share 120,000 refugees from Greece, Italy and Hungary among 22 member states, on top of a proposal in May to share 40,000 refugees from just Greece and Italy.

Denmark’s police chief says his officers have been ordered not to stop hundreds of migrants who have entered the country via Germany.
Jens Henrik Hoejbjerg says Danish officers “can’t detain foreigners who do not want to seek asylum (in Denmark).”
Hoejbjerg said Thursday that the National Police made the decision late Wednesday. There was no immediate reaction from the Danish government.
Under European Union rules, people seeking asylum should do so in the first EU country they enter and not travel from one country to another. Many migrants say they want to go on to Sweden, Norway or Finland, because they have relatives there or believe that conditions for asylum-seekers are better.

Austrian police say more than 3,000 migrants crossed into Austria overnight at Nickelsdorf, the main border point with Hungary.
They say a train carrying up to 500 migrants left for Vienna early Thursday but most remain at Nickelsdorf.
Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck says authorities are meeting to discuss whether further special trains will be sent to the border to take people to Vienna’s Westbahnhof terminal. Most of those arriving there since the influx began last weekend chosen to continue on to Germany.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-germany-merkel-20161120-story.html;2016-11-20;German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she will seek a 4th term next year - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Sunday that she would seek reelection next year, a step that could provide a powerful counterpoint to the anti-globalization, anti-immigration narrative put forth by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
Merkel, facing a backlash against asylum seekers, ended months of speculation about whether she would again take up her party’s standard as a populist tide rises across Europe. Polls have shown she still enjoys strong support, if less so than before Germany, a country of about 80 million people, opened its doors to nearly 1 million new arrivals last year.
“I want to serve Germany,” Merkel, 62, told reporters in Berlin after meeting Sunday with members of her party, the Christian Democratic Union. She acknowledged, though, that “this election will be difficult like no other election since reunification” — the joining of the communist East with West Germany in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Germany’s economic dominance has made Merkel the most important leader in Europe, and she won plaudits for her calm handling of an array of crises, from the threat to Europe’s common currency to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Elections are set to take place in the fall of 2017.
At her news conference, Merkel rejected the notion that with President Obama nearing the end of his second term, she assumes the primary role as a defender of liberal democracy in the West, saying it was “absurd” to think such a role could fall to any one person. But she has aligned herself firmly with the legacy of Obama, who last week made his last visit to Germany as president.
Together, the two leaders penned an op-ed noting that “our countries share a joint responsibility” to defend institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and international agreements such as the Paris climate accord.
Standing beside Obama at a news conference Thursday, Merkel stressed the need to defend the values of “democracy, freedom and human rights” — echoing language she had used in a congratulatory but distinctly admonitory message to Trump after his election win.
Merkel acknowledged that the increasing integration of the world economy had left some behind, and that inequalities needed to be addressed. Globalization, she said, “needs to be given a human face.”

During his campaign, Trump had criticized Merkel, predicting she would be forced from office.
Merkel’s popularity ratings, rock-solid for most of a tenure that began in 2005, fell substantially after the record-breaking wave of immigration in 2015. Her party suffered a string of setbacks in subsequent state elections. Anxiety over asylum seekers bolstered a right-wing party, the Alternative for Germany.
The chancellor came under strong pressure from the Christian Democrats’ sister party in the southern state of Bavaria — the main landing point for migrants making their way to Germany via its Balkan neighbors — to set strictly enforced limits on new arrivals.
Merkel for months strongly defended her decision to open the borders to hundreds of thousands of arrivals, mainly from war-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. In September, though, she acknowledged that she wished she could have turned back the clock to better prepare her country for such an influx, comments widely read as a mea culpa.
“For some time, we didn’t have enough control” of Germany’s frontier, she said then.
Despite the immigrant issue backlash, polls suggest that a majority of Germans — 55% — hope Merkel will serve another term. A poll published Sunday by the Emnid research institute suggested if the elections were held now, her party would win easily, though by smaller margins than previously.
Merkel, a Protestant pastor’s daughter and Germany’s first leader to have come of age in the communist East, is widely regarded as moderate and sober-minded, traits that are attractive to a traditionally risk-averse German electorate.
“Angela Merkel stands for stability, reliability and thoughtfulness,” a senior party colleague, Julia Kloeckner, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
If Merkel wins the election and serves out a full term, it would match the record set by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was at the helm when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. Unlike the United States, Germany has no term limits.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-fg-obama-merkel-20161117-story.html;2016-11-17;Obama and Merkel pair up to warn Trump to take care in world affairs - Los Angeles Times;"President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel jointly admonished President-elect Donald Trump to take seriously his new responsibilities on the world stage — staging an extraordinary scene in which the outgoing president and the leader of the country’s most powerful European ally expressed concern over the newly elected president’s approach to the world.
As Trump prepares to take over the White House, Obama has told Merkel he is worried about whether his successor will stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin as tensions escalate between Russia and the West.
Merkel has questions about what the new administration might mean for economic and national security issues, the victims of Syria’s civil war — Trump has said he wants to keep its refugees out of the U.S. — and the fate of shared values such as the rule of law and human rights.
Together, their message was unmistakable: Too much is at stake for Trump not to take office with serious intent and an understanding of the consequences of his foreign policy.
“He ran an unconventional campaign,” Obama said in a news conference here Thursday alongside Merkel. “He now has to transition to governance.”
“What may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different from what will work in terms of unifying the country,” he said, adding that “the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States … that forces you to focus.
“And if you’re not serious about the job, then you probably won’t be there very long.”
Merkel was more circumspect but expressed clear concern about the possibility that a new administration might fail to stand up to Russian efforts to subvert its neighbors.

“For over 70 years we have been able to enjoy peace,” she said. “To live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud.”
They say that they hope for the best, that Trump’s most outlandish campaign trail utterances will fade as he moves on to new responsibilities. But their warnings were aimed at a president-elect who has taken a scattershot approach to foreign affairs, raising eyebrows if not outright violating diplomatic protocol with some of his moves.
Obama ticked off a number of complicated problems — Syria, Islamic State, climate, refugees — and repeatedly said that taking a multinational approach was the only path toward a solution. It was a stark contrast to Trump’s campaign pledges to tighten U.S. borders and to pull back on longstanding agreements such as the NATO alliance unless other countries pay their fair share.
Obama’s chief foreign policy concern, however, was how Trump would deal with Russia. Obama blamed the nation for cyberattacks during the U.S. election, and his administration has also called for an investigation into Russia’s bombardment of civilians in Syria, where it has provided military assistance to President Bashar Assad. Moscow has said that the U.S. has failed to live up to its agreement to fight terrorism in Syria.
“My hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that, you know, if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria, that we just do whatever is convenient,” Obama said of Trump.
Of particular concern in Europe is Russian aggression in the Baltics following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
“Our conflict with Russia is not just about Ukraine, but also about preserving the international norms, treaties, and laws that have governed behaviors between states since the end of the World War II,” said Michael McFaul, political science professor at Stanford University and Obama’s former senior Russia advisor. “To abandon those principles would have long-term, negative implications for international stability. Obama understands these high stakes.”
Merkel has told reporters that she would cooperate with Trump on the basis of respect for the rule of law and human dignity.
“We cannot stand alone,” she said Thursday. “You cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much even though you may be economically strong,” she said, saying that populists like Trump are preaching “unfriendly policies.”
Obama’s trip took on new dimensions after Trump’s election.
With Trump’s intentions unclear on several fronts, Obama’s final visit to Berlin offered him a moment to hand over leadership to Merkel of the Western liberal world view.
A scientist who grew up in the former East Germany, the dispassionate Merkel is now the world leader with the greatest affinity for Obama. She showered him with praise for their “very close, very intensive cooperation” during his last trip abroad as president and came near to tears as he all but endorsed her for a fourth term as German chancellor. She has not said whether she’ll run.
Her country is a leader on the continent already, having accepted millions of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in recent years in the biggest global humanitarian crisis since World War II and before that, leading the austerity effort to fight the economic crisis.
On Friday, Obama and Merkel plan to draw the leaders of France, Britain, Spain and Italy into the conversation about the future of Europe and their shared global agenda.
Even as Merkel expresses concern about Trump, though, other leaders are heartened by his popular appeal and plain-spoken manner. British leaders were proactive in reaching out to Trump, said Nile Gardiner, a Europe specialist with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Poland and Hungary are also likely to warm to Trump’s disdain for elitists and attention to economic concerns.
“Trump’s approach is very different from that of any previous U.S. president,” Gardiner said. “President Trump is far less likely to cultivate ties with the European Union. His focus will be more upon working with nation states, and individual European leaders, than collaboration with the Euro elites in Brussels.”
Still, a priority for Germany and other major U.S. allies is NATO, the 67-year-old transatlantic military alliance. Trump was critical of NATO during the campaign, threatening to leave it should other countries fail to pay their share. But after their Oval Office meeting two days after his election, Obama said Trump indicated he was devoted to the longstanding U.S. commitment.
While Obama is reticent to represent Trump’s point of view too strongly, according to aides, he emphasized that one affirmative statement after his sit-down with Merkel.
“I am encouraged by the president-elect’s insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change,” Obama said.
If Obama and Merkel are hoping to persuade Trump, their first step is to mute their criticism.
After their meeting at the chancellery, Merkel emerged declaring that European leaders “understood the message” about the importance of transatlantic allies stepping up their engagement and correcting the imbalance in contributions to NATO.

But in what started out as a routine address to the parliament Thursday previewing next weekend’s summit of leaders from the world’s 20 largest economies, Europe’s most important leader turned uncharacteristically dark in condemning some of the views that have found popular support in the U.S. and elsewhere.
“Anyone who thinks the world’s problems can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is simply delusional,” Merkel said. “The only way we’re going to succeed in finding the right answers to the central questions of our age is by working together.”
The G-20 summit, scheduled for July 7 and 8 in Hamburg, could prove turbulent, with massive anti-globalization demonstrations planned as President Trump and other world leaders discuss issues including trade, climate change and migration.
More than 20,000 police will be on hand, because German authorities are expecting as many as 150,000 people from across Europe to fill the streets on the second day for a protest called “G20 Not Welcome Here.”
Police are expecting 8,000 anarchists for another demonstration, on the eve of the summit, called “Welcome to Hell.”
The presence of Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Europe, as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose policies are viewed with suspicion, also worried authorities charged with crowd control.
The German government on Thursday rejected a request by Erdogan to speak at a rally of ethnic Turks living in Germany outside the summit.

Merkel told the parliament that she expected the talks in Hamburg to be “difficult.”
Since last year’s summit in Hangzhou, China, she said, major gulfs had opened between once-close allies, such as the United States and the major economies of the European Union that make up the core of the G20.
“The world has become troubled and divided,” she said. “The differences are obvious and it would be dishonest to try to cover that up — I won’t be doing that.”
She promised in particular to stand up for the Paris climate agreement, which suffered a severe blow this month when Trump announced that the U.S. was pulling out.
“Ever since the decision by the United States to leave the Paris climate agreement, we’ve become more determined than ever to make it a success,” Merkel said. “We’ve got to tackle this existential threat and we can’t and won’t simply wait around until everyone on the planet has been convinced that there is enough scientific proof that it is happening. The Paris agreement is irreversible and non-negotiable.”
Merkel never spoke Trump’s name. She had tried to find ways to work with Trump but has since taken a more defiant stance against him.
A leader of Social Democratic Party, which is part of Merkel’s coalition, was less diplomatic.
“Donald Trump is dividing the Western world,” Thomas Oppermann told parliament after the chancellor finished. “On the climate issue, it’s Trump against the rest of the world. There’s got to be a 19 against 1 alliance against him in Hamburg.”

Though neither Peña Nieto nor Merkel mentioned President Trump by name during their joint news conference in Mexico City, his pugnacious relationship with both countries was the backdrop for much of what they had to say.
Peña Nieto said Merkel’s two-day state visit comes “at a crucial time for the world.”
“It is extremely important to defend the values we share,” he said.
Those values include free trade, a principle at the core of Mexico’s relationship with the United States, and one Trump has threatened in an attempt to erase a trade gap of roughly $60 billion in Mexico’s favor.
They also include combating climate change, Peña Nieto said. After Trump this month announced he will be withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, Mexico and Germany both announced they would stay in the accord and press forward.
In her remarks, Merkel emphasized the importance of nations having relationships with a wide range of countries instead of relying on alliances with just a few.
In recent weeks, as Trump has attacked Germany for its trade surplus with the U.S. and for not spending enough on defense to meet its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Merkel has said that Europe “can no longer rely” on its longtime ally, the United States. Europeans, she said at a recent campaign rally in Munich, must “take our fate into our own hands.”

Some political scientists viewed Merkel’s visit to Mexico as an attempt to forge a global leadership role amid what some see as a possible rearrangement of international alliances in the Trump era. Before the trip, Germany’s ambassador to Mexico called Merkel’s visit a “sign of solidarity” with the Latin American nation, which has been one of Trump’s favorite targets since he launched his campaign for president in 2015.
If that was her goal, Merkel did not obviously embrace it Friday night. She side-stepped questions from journalists that would have offered her the chance to criticize Trump, and she declined to address a question about whether she is taking on a new global leadership role.
Rather, Merkel focused on the importance of the upcoming Group of 20 summit and emphasized the importance of her country’s trade relationship with Mexico, which is valued at $18 billion. Merkel traveled to Mexico with a large delegation of German business leaders looking to broaden an existing trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year.
Though Merkel repeatedly praised Mexico, she also took the opportunity to gently scold Peña Nieto on his nation’s human rights record. She spoke of the importance of protecting journalists, who are killed in Mexico at an alarmingly high rate, and about bringing to justice those behind Mexico’s high number of forced disappearances.
“It is important to punish and find the culprits; it is vitally important,” Merkel said.
The two leaders have a series of events and more talks scheduled for Saturday.

Merkel flew to Paris on Monday to consult with French President Francois Hollande on a new approach to Greece’s debt crisis a day after Greek voters rejected her signature strategy for getting Athens’ finances in order.
As leader of the Eurozone’s largest and most influential country, Merkel has been the key architect of Eurozone bailouts that have forced tough austerity measures on Greece in exchange for loans enabling it to remain part of the 19-nation common currency club.
The German chancellor is widely resented in Greece for favoring budget cuts by Athens rather than investment in job creation and growth. At the same time, her support for austerity is applauded by politicians across a wide spectrum in Germany and other prosperous Eurozone states.
The result leaves Merkel confronted with competing pressures: Holding the Greeks’ feet to the fire means risking the first failure of the European Union’s common currency experiment, which would mar her otherwise vaunted tenure as its de facto leader.
Merkel and Hollande issued a brief statement after their meeting, revealing divergent views on how best to remedy Greece’s grave economic crisis. Both called for swift resolution of the dispute between Athens and its creditors, but Hollande urged “solidarity” with the struggling Greeks while Merkel called on them to take “responsibility” and reform their taxing and spending habits.
During five years of imposed austerity, the Greek economy has contracted by 25%, and more than a quarter of the working-age population is unemployed. Grinding poverty and an eroding social safety net induced voters to reject their creditors’ demands for more belt-tightening with a 61% “no” vote in Sunday’s referendum.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist government had urged voters to say no to more austerity, spoke with Merkel by telephone Monday and said he would bring new proposals to an emergency meeting of the Eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, a Greek government official told reporters in Athens.

But with both voters and the government having spurned what was presented as a final offer by the major creditors — the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission — many European leaders believe there is nothing left to talk about.
Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters at a Berlin news conference that the chancellor “takes notice” of the rejection and respects it as the will of the voters.
“However, in light of the decision by the Greek citizens, the conditions to start negotiations on a new aid program are not met yet,” Seibert said, adding that Berlin would “wait and see what the Greek government makes of it.”
Seibert said the German government was “stressing the principle that solidarity is inseparable from [a country’s] own efforts,” implying that the attempt by Athens to get a significant write-down on its debts was not in the offing.

Those in the Eurozone who support holding Greece to its previous commitments exuded frustration and showed signs of losing patience after the referendum.
Though Merkel may be reluctant to see the integrity of the Eurozone breached, her conservative colleagues in the grand coalition that governs Germany are of the view that the Greek “no” vote may well be a prelude to the country’s exit from the Eurozone — a “Grexit,” as it has become known.
The referendum was a clear signal that Athens refuses to be beholden to its creditors, said Markus Ferber, who oversees euro policy for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union.
“The country and the government have knocked away the helping hand” of their Eurozone colleagues, Ferber said. “The only chance for Greece now is to leave the euro.”
The Economist Intelligence Unit, an independent forecasting and advisory service of the Economist Group, put the chances of a Greek exit from the Eurozone at 60%.
Opposition political forces in Germany also signaled readiness to interpret the referendum result as a rejection of what is required to stay in the Eurozone, even if many Greeks voted “no” because their leaders suggested it would compel the creditors to offer a substantial debt write-off and more lenient plan for repaying the rest.
“Now Merkel and the others [of the European creditors] must organize a Grexit, with all the cushions and upheavals that will result as a consequence,” said Alexander Graf Lambsdorff of the Free Democratic Party, one of the German politicians willing to take no for an answer even if that wasn’t what many Greeks meant.

https://www.latimes.com/la-oe-mcmanus-merkel-europe-economy-20111016-column.html;2014-03-20;Doyle McManus: Merkel intent on keeping Eurozone united - Los Angeles Times;"Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s impossible prime minister, has committed almost every sin that modern politics affords. He entertains barely-of-age girls as overnight guests and brags about it. He appoints business cronies and television starlets to government jobs. He’s under perpetual investigation for corruption.
But voters in Berlusconi’s conservative base have always seemed willing to forgive him — until now. The prime minister survived a close vote in Parliament last week, but the talk in Italy is increasingly of how soon he will fall. Why, after all that’s come before, have Italians finally lost patience with Berlusconi? In part because he recently picked the wrong target to insult.
In a wiretapped conversation reported a few weeks ago, Berlusconi described Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, with a phrase too vulgar to be printed in this newspaper but that meant he considered her too unattractive to invite to his bed.
Bad move. Italy, whose government debt is 120% of its gross domestic product, needs Germany’s help — and Merkel’s protection — to avoid a run on its bonds. “We’re all hoping the Germans can figure out a way to get us out of this mess,” an Italian banker told me recently.
It’s not just Italy that finds itself needing Merkel and the Germans. Greece is already in a state of economic catastrophe; Spain and Portugal are on the brink. And Europe’s economic crisis has spread far beyond its inefficient southern economies to the banks in northern countries, such as Germany and France, that are holding those governments’ no-longer-reliable bonds. If banks in Frankfurt and Paris begin to fail, the continent could slide into another recession — and take the U.S. economy with it.
That has made Europe’s crisis bigger but, oddly enough, easier to fix, with considerable help from Merkel and her country. When it looked like a matter of bailing out feckless Greeks, Italians and Spaniards in their sunny vacationlands, German taxpayers understandably objected to paying the bill. But now that the problem has escalated into a crisis that could topple their own banks, the Germans and their cautious chancellor have changed sides and committed themselves to big, fast action, including an expanded European Financial Stability Facility fund to recapitalize the banks. Roger Altman, the former No. 2 in President Clinton’s Treasury Department, has dubbed the idea “EuroTARP,” after the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program. Like the American version, it’s likely to be expensive and unpopular — but also necessary and, with luck, effective.
Merkel’s decision to act has had political implications far beyond the financial technicalities. The German leader had to choose between two stark alternatives: to make the Eurozone of 17 countries that have adopted a single currency a closer, more integrated economic unit, or to begin working on an orderly breakup. She opted for integration. “The euro is the guarantee of a united Europe,” she told the German Parliament last month. “If the euro fails, then Europe fails.”
In the meantime, the European Union will have to make difficult choices about whose money goes into the stability fund and who will be allowed to draw money from it. (Imagine what it would have been like to launch TARP if every state legislature had been allowed to weigh in.)

Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have made a great show of working as a partnership, but it’s clear that Germany — the continent’s biggest healthy economy and the only one that can really guarantee new financing — is in charge. The Economist recently printed a cartoon that showed Merkel driving a muscular BMW motorcycle, with Sarkozy sitting glumly in the sidecar.
Originally, the euro was supposed to limit Germany’s economic power by making it merely one of 17 partners backing a single strong currency. Instead, the Eurozone’s weakness has forced Germany to lead, and forced France and others to accept that Berlin is in charge. Soon there will be tougher fiscal rules for governments in Paris, Rome, Madrid and Athens — and they will all need to pass muster in Berlin.
Americans have a stake in their success. A European recession could push the U.S. economy into a double dip. And U.S. banks aren’t immune from the European disease. It’s estimated that American banks hold more than $600 billion in government bonds issued by the PIIGS — Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.
A successful Europe is good for U.S. foreign policy as well. When European countries feel prosperous, they’re more able to contribute to joint actions abroad, such as the war in Afghanistan or the bombing in Libya. If Europe is divided and poor, our allies may not be as helpful as we’d like.
In an earlier era, Americans might have found some comfort in Europe’s troubles. We might have enjoyed watching supercilious foreigners find that their political and economic systems could be just as dysfunctional as ours. Back in 2008, Europeans enjoyed pointing fingers at Americans for dragging the world into a slump. We may have had subprime mortgages; they have entire subprime countries.
But globalization, which was supposed to make us all rich and happy, hasn’t merely fallen short of that goal. It’s made us all mutually vulnerable and mutually worried. It’s even robbed us of the pleasure of an old European emotion: schadenfreude.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-merkel-berlin-election-20160920-snap-story.html;2016-09-20;German Chancellor Angela Merkel takes some blame for poor Berlin election performance - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel took partial responsibility for her party’s worst performance in a Berlin state election, acknowledging Monday that her government’s policies at the national level were a factor.
Merkel pledged to work harder to address people’s concerns, particularly on migrants. Her Christian Democratic Union party, or CDU, received just 17.6% of the vote in the German capital.
“That’s very bitter,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin, referring to the drop of almost 6 percentage points her party suffered.
The result means that Berlin state’s current coalition government, in which the CDU is the junior partner to the center-left Social Democrats, or SPD, has no majority going forward. A three-way coalition of Social Democrats, the Green Party and the Left Party is now likely in the capital.
While the Berlin vote was seen partly as a referendum on Merkel’s handling of the migrant crisis, the state government has no control over Germany’s immigration policy. The left-leaning coalition that could take over office likely would be more welcoming of refugees than the current state government.
Both CDU and SPD — which saw its share of the vote drop 6.7 points to 21.6% — lost voters to the nationalist Alternative for Germany, which has campaigned heavily against immigration. The party, known as AfD, entered its 10th state parliament Sunday with 14.2% of the vote. The nationalists’ strong result is particularly remarkable because the city of 3.5 million is usually known for its liberal attitude.
“I take responsibility as party leader and chancellor,” Merkel said at a news conference alongside her party’s mayoral candidate, Frank Henkel.
Speaking in unusually self-critical terms, Merkel edged away from her oft-repeated mantra — first uttered during the height of the migrant crisis last year — that “we will manage.”

Merkel said that while she stands by the sentiment, some voters had taken it as a provocation in view of the massive challenge that the country faces integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants.
She also acknowledged that for years, Germany had benefited from rules that required refugees to apply for asylum in the first European Union country they enter, shielding her government from the pressure felt by other nations on the bloc’s frontiers.
“If I could, I would turn back time by many, many years in order to better prepare the entire German government and everyone else in a position of responsibility for the situation that hit us largely unprepared at the end of summer 2015,” Merkel said.
She reiterated her view that Germany already has performed a herculean task to cope with the unprecedented influx of migrants over the past year, but acknowledged that more work needs to be done, including to prevent extremist attacks of the kind seen over the summer.
“Not every refugee came to our country with good intentions,” she said.
Merkel added that she’s prepared to address voters’ concerns about migrants, but that if people simply don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers because of their religion, then that would be counter to her Christian Democratic Party’s basic principles, as well as Germany’s.
“The CDU and I can’t go along with that,” she said.
Henkel, who has been in charge of security matters in Berlin for the past five years, added it was wrong to think there had been no improvement over the past year. He noted that last fall, up to 1,000 refugees were arriving in the capital each day, while that figure is down to between 25 and 30 now.
Berlin’s notoriously inefficient bureaucracy, rising rents and ailing transport infrastructure — especially the much-delayed new airport — dominated the election campaign in Germany’s biggest city, driving voters away from the centrist coalition toward the left and right.
The anti-capitalist Left Party, a descendant of the former East German communists, gained 3.9 points to 15.6%. The Green Party received 15.2%, down by 2.4 percentage points.
Many disillusioned Berliners who didn’t vote in the last election backed the nationalist Alternative for Germany, however, driving turnout up to 66.9% from 60.2% in 2011.
The three-year-old party came fresh from election success in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania two weeks ago, where it beat Merkel’s CDU into third place.
Party leaders announced Monday that they now are setting their sights on next year’s federal election and aiming for a double-digit result. AfD narrowly missed clearing the 5% threshold to enter the national Parliament in 2013. Since then, the party has shifted rightward and campaigned heavily against immigration.
Party co-chairwoman Frauke Petry cited recent opinion polls predicting the party could receive 14% to 15% at the national level and suggested that AfD would be prepared to take on government responsibility from 2021 if it gets sufficient backing from voters.
AfD has been dogged by revelations about members espousing extremist views and having ties to far-right groups — including two candidates who stood for the party in Berlin. Co-chairman Joerg Meuthen said AfD was trying to solve the problem and stressed that the party wouldn’t tolerate anti-Semitism in its ranks.
Merkel said her party would reach out to disaffected voters, including those who had backed AfD in recent elections because of fears about the impact that migrants will have on the country.
“Germany will change, as we will all change, if we’re not of stone,” she said. “But its foundations won’t be shaken.”
She declined to declare whether she will seek a fourth term in next year’s election, though she is widely expected to do so.
Merkel indicated that she was willing to offer an olive branch to the CDU’s Bavaria-only sister-party, which is part of her government at the national level together with the Social Democrats.
Bavarian Gov. Horst Seehofer, who has been sharply critical of the chancellor on the migrants’ issue, told Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday that the situation for his and Merkel’s Union bloc “has never been so difficult.”
Merkel said she wouldn’t accept a “static” cap on the number of migrants coming to Germany, leaving open the possibility that some sort of flexible maximum could be introduced — a position she previously has rejected."

https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2011-jun-07-la-pn-white-house-state-dinner-20110607-story.html;2011-06-07;State Dinner: Obama, Merkel toast freedom in Rose Garden - Los Angeles Times;"President Obama hosted a state dinner Tuesday for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, using his first lady’s favorite real estate -- the Rose Garden -- for the soiree.
About 206 guests, long on German heritage but short on Hollywood glitz, gathered on a balmy late-spring night for the outdoor party.
Obama presented Merkel with the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor a president may bestow.
First-rate American fare, including food, wines and performer James Taylor, was showcased.
Notable guests included architect Helmut Jahn and conductor Christoph Eschenbach, plus diplomats and members of the Cabinet, Congress and Bundestag.
Obama told Merkel he chose the Rose Garden as the venue because it hearkened back to a 2008 rally in Berlin’s Tiergarten during his presidential campaign.
The dinner menu, centered on petite filet with Maryland crab ravioli, featured a nod to Obama’s heritage (Hawaiian tuna tartare) and Merkel’s (apple strudel and schlag, which is unsweetened whipped cream, for dessert).
It was dubbed “a spring harvest dinner,” a tribute to the White House herbs, vegetables and honey interspersed in the cuisine.
First Lady Michelle Obama selected -- again -- Indian American designer Naeem Khan to design her dress, a glimmering, cream-colored, sleeveless gown.

The dinner was a test for the Obamas’ new social secretary Jeremy Bernard, the third person to hold the post in less than 2 1/2 years.
Dinner guests sat at round or rectangular tables adorned with gold-rimmed china from the George W. Bush administration, yellow Calla lilies, green viburnum and yellow oncidium orchids.
Merkel, 56, grew up under communism and earned a Ph.D. in physics before turning to politics. She is the first East German and first woman to lead Germany, where East and West joined hands in 1990.
Chancellor since 2005, she’s become one of Obama’s closest partners on the world stage. Her trip this week -- technically an official visit, not a state visit -- represented her 10th meeting with him, White House officials said.
The Medal of Freedom is most often given to Americans, though Pope John Paul II and former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are past honorees. White House officials dubbed Merkel a symbol of the “triumph of freedom” given her roots in communist East Germany.
She was accompanied by her spouse, Joachim Sauer, a chemistry professor at the University of Humboldt.
Earlier Obama state dinners feted the leaders of India, Mexico and China. Given Germany’s size (81 million) and stature (Europe’s economic engine) -- plus the fact that more than one-quarter of Americans claim some German heritage -- the latest event was a savvy choice.
About 30 musicians with the National Symphony Orchestra were to perform, but Merkel’s favorite composer, Wagner, wasn’t on the program. Instead: Beethoven, Handel and Mendelssohn.
Space was tight -- too tight for the full orchestra’s 108 musicians. “Wagner needs a full orchestra,” Eschenbach shrugged.
The wines were from the U.S. -- most often they are at state dinners -- but another nod to Germany came in austere and sculptural Bauhaus touches in the topiaries and floral arrangements.
Obama, in raising a glass to Merkel, toasted freedom, “which must be struggled for and then defended anew, every day of our lives.”
Merkel recalled being a girl of 7 when the Berlin Wall was built, driving her parents into tears and separating her mother’s family. “For many years, I dreamt of freedom,” she remembered, saying neither dictatorship nor oppression “can keep down the forces of freedom for long.”"
https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-greek-leader-germany-20150323-story.html;2015-03-23;Greek premier has 'fruitful exchange' with Germany's Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"Monday editions of the bestselling German tabloid Bild neatly summed up the complicated relationship being played out in talks between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Tsipras arrived in Germany, Bild blared greetings in Greek, and offered an article listing “50 reasons why the Greeks are dear to us.” Among them: olive oil, yogurt, the ancient mathematician Archemides and the modern singer Nana Mouskouri.
Still, unable to resist a jibe, the newspaper, which has been critical of Greece throughout its debt crisis, proffered the Greek leader tips on thriftiness. “Look Mr. Tsipras, this is how to save money,” the headline declared.
Merkel was not as blunt.
With relations soured by bad blood over Athens’ debt woes, World War II reparation claims and lesser frictions, both leaders – meeting to discuss details of reform plans aimed at keeping Greece afloat -- agreed to stop slugging it out.
“This meeting is the first stage in a new relationship between Greece and Germany,” Tsipras said. “We had a fruitful exchange that determined both common ground and differences between us. And that’s fine, because if we do not determine those differences, we will not be able to bridge them.
Top among them, the Greek leader said, was removing stereotypes that portray Greeks as lazy and Germans as the source of Greece’s debt woes.
“We want to see Greece grow strong,” said Merkel. “We can work together, but we can also disagree.”
The upbeat remarks and breezy body language marked a stark contrast to the furrowed brows and verbal sniping traded between Greek and German ministers in recent weeks, sinking relations to record lows.

Even so, it remained unclear whether the two leaders managed to narrow major differences on economic reforms.
“If they don’t,” warned Kostantinos Filis, director of the Athens-based Institute of International Relations, “this bloodletting could see toxic repercussions.”
Ahead of the talks, German officials had scrambled to downplay the drama in the Greek leader’s first official visit to Berlin since the left-wing, anti-austerity Syriza party surged to power in late January.
More than 1,100 miles south, in Athens, fears of a showdown gripped Greeks.
A cartoon in To Vima, the most revered newspaper here, pictured a sweating Tsipras in jeans pumping an old-fashioned railway handcar up a hill -- with Merkel at the top, timing him. Television networks followed every step of Tsipras’ trip, portraying the leader’s visit as a daring foray into a lion’s den of fury and popular resentment over Athens’ newfound refusal to accept any more of Germany’s bitter prescription of austerity.
Monday’s meeting, the second get-together in five days, followed promises by the Greek leader to tweak a list of reforms in order to unlock a first tranche of about $2 billion that Athens needs to make debt repayments by the end of the month. The alternative could be eviction from the Eurozone.
Carefully dodging any comment, Merkel merely insisted that Athens stick to its commitments.
Although German officials were saying that Merkel would avoid discussing the reforms with Tsipras, German politicians -- and taxpayers funding Athens’ rescue -- were demanding that she press the issue, and that the Greek leader reciprocate.
“It would be good if Tsipras can convince the chancellor… that he grasps the seriousness of the situation,” said Markus Soeder, Bavaria’s conservative state finance minister. “So far, Greece has promised and not delivered.”
Tsipras, 40, and a former Communist party youth leader, has already warned Merkel that it would be impossible for cash-strapped Greece to service its debt obligations without a fresh injection of rescue aid. Failure to secure that, he wrote in a veiled threat to the head of Europe’s powerhouse economy, would force him to choose between paying off loans or pension and wage payments --- both precursors to a chaotic default.
Merkel, who lived through the uncontrolled collapse of communism in East Germany 25 years ago, has repeatedly said her political goal is to keep the euro area secure. But indicative of growing German frustration over Greece, a recent opinion poll showed that more than 50% of Germans surveyed preferred to let Europe’s weakest financial member leave the 19-member euro currency club.
Renewed calls by Athens for Merkel’s coalition to pay reparations to victims of Nazi war crimes, and threats to unleash a wave of migrants, including Islamic State militants, to the heart of Europe if Greece is left to go broke, have added to voter impatience in Germany.
But on Monday, Tsipras put seemed determined to bridge that rift in relations, denying any designs by Athens to confiscate German assets in payback of reparations. He even leapt to Merkel’s defense, saying caricatures depicting her as a Nazi officer outside the Acropolis were “wrong and unjust.”
“Today’s democratic Germany has nothing to do with the Germany of the Third Reich that took such a toll of blood,” he said.
With the two leaders set to work through the night, pundits and politicians on both sides ruled out a major political breakthrough.
“But by rebooting trust and confidence, tensions can calm down,” Filis said. “This isn’t just about economics,” he added.
Indeed, with the prospect of Greece turning into a loose cannon within the European Union and NATO, aggravating Washington’s ability to deal with geopolitical challenges in nearby Russia and Syria, U.S officials, including President Obama, have waded into the Eurozone crisis, urging Berlin to seek a compromise solution with Greece.
Tsipras has vowed to honor promises to submit a fresh draft of reforms to overhaul the Greek economy “as soon as possible.”Although no specific date has been set, Eurozone officials have said they could discuss aid payments at an emergency meeting as early as March 27. Officials in Athens were aiming for March 29.
How soon that happens, pundits and politicians predict, depends on how big a compromise Tsipras is prepared to make with Merkel, and whether he can sell that deal to hard-left backbenchers, already threatening a revolt.
“We are very near the moment where things could get out of control,” said noted writer and analyst Nikos Dimou. “An accident… [even] a sudden run on bank could happen. Humpty Dumpty may fall off the wall.”

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in her first substantive response to a string of violent episodes over the last 10 days, on Thursday repeated the same utterance she made famous last year as the nation opened its borders to an enormous flood of refugees and migrants.
Merkel’s calm insistence that German society could absorb large numbers of newcomers from war-torn countries — despite safety fears and rising criticism of her migrant policies — carried echoes of the passionate debate over immigration that is roiling the U.S. presidential campaign.
Whereas Republican nominee Donald Trump has threatened to deny Muslims entry and build a wall to keep out Mexicans, the party of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has painted diversity and openness as crucial elements of the American experiment.
In her annual summer news conference, the German chancellor announced new measures aimed at helping authorities pinpoint and act on security threats, but at the same time made it clear that she believed that too heavy-handed a reaction to recent events would play into the hands of militant groups.
Merkel is determined to stay the course on welcoming migrants into Germany, which has become increasingly controversial &#8212; that&#8217;s obviously the bottom line.
— Christopher Chivvis, associate director of Rand Corp.âs International Security and Defense Policy Center
“They want to damage our way of life, our openness and, yes, our ability to take in people in distress,” the German leader said. She called the absorption of migrants and refugees, more than 1 million of whom entered Germany in 2015, a “historic task.”
Merkel’s calculated repetition of last summer’s signature phrase “Wir schaffen das” — “We’ll manage it” — was widely interpreted as a deliberate signal that she harbored no qualms over the decision to throw wide the gates to those fleeing violence and persecution.
The number of arrivals this year has dropped off dramatically as a result of a European agreement with Turkey to stem the flow of migrants across a narrow stretch of the Aegean to Greece, but the issue remains a lightning rod for debate.

“Merkel is determined to stay the course on welcoming migrants into Germany, which has become increasingly controversial — that’s obviously the bottom line,” said Christopher Chivvis, the associate director of Rand Corp.’s International Security and Defense Policy Center.
In the southern German state of Bavaria, where three of four recent episodes of bloodshed took place, officials said Thursday that they would add an additional 2,000 police officers in the next three years and set up special divisions to monitor Islamic extremists and fight cybercrime.
Germany’s European neighbors, too, are caught up in tangled questions of assimilation, national identity and public safety in the face of recent traumatic events.
In France — where Islamic State claimed responsibility for a Bastille Day truck rampage on a Riviera promenade that killed 84 and for this week’s knife slaughter of an elderly Roman Catholic priest in Normandy — authorities on Thursday disclosed that the second of the two slain church assailants, like the first, had managed to carry out the attack despite being on a security watch list.
The government of President Francois Hollande, already under pressure over perceived security lapses before the July 14 truck rampage in Nice, came under sharp new pressure over the disclosures that the second of two young church attackers, whose identity was disclosed Thursday, had also aspired to join Islamic State on the battlefield in Syria.
Analysts said it was important not to conflate the differing circumstances of a drumbeat of attacks on European soil this month.
Islamic State took responsibility for two strikes in Germany: a July 18 knife-and-ax rampage aboard a commuter train outside a Bavarian town by an Afghan teenager, and six days later, a suicide bombing outside an open-air concert, also in southern Germany, by a Syrian man facing deportation. The train attack injured four passengers and a female passerby; the suicide bomber killed only himself, but injured 15 bystanders.
They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State in Germany.
But German officials were markedly careful not to jump to conclusions during a gunman’s deadly rampage on July 22 in Munich, Bavaria’s capital, and a lockdown that shut down the country’s third-largest city for hours. That caution was warranted: The assailant turned out to be a German teenager of Iranian descent described by authorities as fascinated by mass murderers, but with no known ties to extremist groups.
Bavaria’s interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, told journalists Thursday that the Munich shooter apparently thought it was auspicious that his birthday, April 20, was the same as Adolf Hitler’s.
Another episode the same day as the suicide bombing, in which a Syrian man hacked a female co-worker to death with a meat cleaver, unsettled many Germans despite what authorities said was a lack of any political overtones associated with the attack.
Merkel and her allies have stressed that the vast majority of those seeking shelter in Germany pose no threat. But the chancellor’s once-invincible popularity has been significantly eroded by the social upheaval that has accompanied the refugee flood.
And the crucial accord with Turkey could be imperiled by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s increasingly bellicose stance toward Europe and the West in the aftermath of a failed coup against him.
Germany, like France, is scrambling to decode online forensic evidence that could point to attackers’ methods, motives and potential accomplices.
More details emerged Thursday about the Syrian suicide bomber, Mohammed Daleel; Herrmann said the man had been in touch via an online chat with someone in an unidentified Middle East country shortly before blowing himself up.
Merkel, whose upbringing in the former East Germany is seen as having strongly marked her views on the responsibility to take in those needing a safe haven, urged compatriots to not let anxiety cause them to lose sight of democratic values.
“The fact that the events caused great insecurity” isn’t in question, she said. “But fear can’t be a good counsel for political actions.”

As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump derided Merkel’s open-arms refugee policy as a “disaster,” questioned her trustworthiness and threatened to impose import penalties on German car makers.
In style and substance, the two leaders — one hot-tempered and confrontational, the other unflappable and detail-oriented — could not be more different. On policy, they disagree on immigration and refugees, a resurgent Russia, global trade deals and the European Union.
On Friday, President Trump will welcome Merkel to the White House for their first sit-down summit in what both sides see as a chance to seek common ground and restore stability in trans-Atlantic relations.
“The stakes for this meeting, … and for this relationship even more so, are very high,” said Heather Conley, Europe program director at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
But she said expectations are low for the meeting, which was postponed until Friday after a snowstorm hit the East Coast.
“I’m not even sure expectation is the right word,” Conley said. “We have to think about these things as managing through a fairly turbulent moment [in the U.S.], trying to begin to establish that relationship and framework and setting down a clear set of markers of values and principles.”
The two are expected to discuss strengthening the NATO military alliance, collaborating in the fight against terrorism and Islamic State, and taking steps to resolve the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, where Russia has intervened.

Merkel, who has been chancellor since 2005, has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin more often than any other foreign leader, and U.S. officials believe she has more than held her own.
A senior Trump administration official, who briefed reporters last week on condition of anonymity, said Trump “will be very interested in hearing the chancellor’s views on her experience interacting with Putin … very interested in hearing her insights and what it’s like to deal with the Russians.”
Previous U.S. administrations have viewed Germany as a bulwark against Russian aggression in an increasingly troubled Europe, and the glue that holds together U.S.-European sanctions against Moscow following its 2014 seizure of Crimea.
After Trump appeared to suggest he might ease sanctions on Russia, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen publicly warned Washington at last month’s Munich Security Conference, with Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis in attendance, not to attempt to forge a separate deal with Moscow.
Administration officials have since said sanctions would remain in place.
On trade, the United States has a trade deficit with Germany, its largest trading partner in Europe. The Trump administration has accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro.
The two leaders have clashed on spending for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance created to counter Soviet advances during the Cold War and now used to help fight the Taliban in Afghanistan and to block Russian pressure in Eastern Europe.
Senior administration officials last week said they were encouraged that Germany had agreed to boost its annual defense spending by more than 5% to $39 billion.
But German defense spending is still below the NATO target of 2% of annual economic output. The U.S. spent about 3.6% of gross domestic product on defense last year, and Trump wants to boost it by $54 billion, or 10%.
Merkel’s visit to Washington comes at a tumultuous time in Europe.
Following Britain’s referendum in June to withdraw from the European Union, regional agreements are in danger of unraveling, and nationalist populist parties have gained new currency in several countries.
In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, leader of a far-right Freedom Party, surged in the polls after he called for shuttering mosques and closing borders to refugees and immigrants from Islamic countries. But in national elections Wednesday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s center-right party won the largest share of the votes.
In France, a political shakeup appears likely after elections that begin on April 23. Top establishment candidates have dropped out, leaving radical nationalist leader Marine Le Pen among the three remaining contenders.
In England, Prime Minister Theresa May won a parliamentary battle this week to start the so-called Brexit talks, a move likely to damage the British economy and European unity. And Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon called for a new referendum on Scottish independence, which could dismember Great Britain.
Putin has evinced support for Le Pen in France, as well as for the German nationalist party that could complicate Merkel’s attempt to win a fourth term as chancellor in September.
All these developments have thrust Europe into uncertain territory, with the added unknown of an unpredictable U.S. administration.

https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2013-sep-22-la-fg-germany-election-20130923-story.html;2013-09-22;Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats win German elections - Los Angeles Times;"BERLIN — Angela Merkel’s conservatives won a major victory in Sunday’s German elections, according to official results, putting her in position to serve a third term as chancellor after negotiations to form a coalition with the left-wing opposition.

The results showed Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union at 41.5%, leading the main opposition Social Democrats by 17 percentage points.

A new party founded in opposition to the euro, the Alternative for Germany, received 4.7% of the vote, below the 5% threshold needed to enter Parliament. Merkel’s current coalition partners, the Free Democrats, had 4.8% of the vote. It means that the liberal, pro-business party will drop out of the Bundestag, the lower house, for the first time in its history.

The Christian Democrats will probably seek a “grand coalition” with the Social Democrats to form a stable government.

“This is a super result,” said Merkel, 59, when it became clear she is on target to serve another four-year term. “Together, we will do all we can to make the next four years successful ones for Germany.”

Projections based on early results showed the Christian Democrats winning 296 seats in the 598-seat Bundestag, four seats short of a majority. The Social Democrats would have 182 seats, and their allies, the Greens, 60. Die Linke, or the Left, a far-left party descended from East Germany’s Communists, would also have 60 seats.

The Free Democrats had been the kingmaker of German politics since the first postwar vote in 1949. But the party has struggled as Merkel’s junior coalition partner. While the chancellor has claimed credit for Germany’s economic success, little of the Free Democrats’ political program has been enacted.

Christian Lindner, a former general secretary of the party, told state broadcaster ARD that Sunday’s elections marked “the most bitter hour since 1949"" for his party.


The Christian Democrats’ share of the vote was up 8 percentage points from the 2009 elections, but the Free Democrats’ plummeted. Ursula von der Leyen, the Christian Democratic labor minister, told ARD that the outcome was “simply fantastic” for her party.

As its price for joining a coalition, the Social Democrats would be expected to demand the introduction of a national minimum wage and an increase in the top rate of taxation. Both policies are opposed by the Christian Democrats as harmful for job creation.

The Social Democrats may also push for a softer line on the Eurozone crisis, including some means of jointly guaranteeing state debts across the single currency zone.

Surveys show that Merkel’s cautious handling of the Eurozone crisis is strongly endorsed by the public. After eight years in power, her approval ratings still regularly top 60%.

The chancellor has presided over a strong economy with low unemployment. She boasts of keeping Germany stable despite turmoil across the continent.

Her Social Democratic challenger, Peer Steinbrueck, has accused her of prescribing a “deadly dose” of austerity for the Eurozone, saying the government’s crisis strategy lacks a “growth impulse.”

Germany’s new government will have to steer the country through a dramatic shift to renewable energy and cope with the needs of an aging population.

“It should not take ages, but I don’t think there’s any reason to fight now, pushing for a short time period” before talks begin, she told journalists, adding that the vote is “not a reason to be in some way nasty in the negotiations.”
Merkel also underscored that even from outside the EU, “Great Britain will remain a close partner with close economic ties to us.”
Her remarks Saturday suggest that the weekend has brought Britain and Europe no closer to clarity on the implications of Thursday’s British referendum on leaving the European Union.
Parliament has supreme authority, but it is highly unlikely to reverse the mandate delivered by the voters.
— Nicolas Veron, Bruegel Brussels
Political leaders in both places have split on whether the vote, though technically nonbinding on the British Parliament, should lead immediately to negotiations with the 27 other EU member states on a formal divorce.
Merkel’s cautious approach put her at odds with some of her governing coalition partners in Germany.
After meeting with European colleagues Saturday, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is not from the same party as the chancellor, appeared to be in favor of hastening Britain’s exit from the EU.

“This process should get underway as soon as possible so that we are not left in limbo, so that we can concentrate on the future of Europe,” he said.
Days after the “Brexit” vote, the political and economic toll for Britain continued to climb. Jonathan Hill, who as the equivalent of the EU’s finance minister was Britain’s highest-ranking diplomat in the union, resigned his Brussels post Saturday, stating, “What’s done cannot be undone.”
Across Britain, there were already signs that the split could be more complicated than many had initially assumed — and there were growing calls for a do-over.
A petition on Parliament’s website calling for a second referendum had gathered more than 1.9 million signatures by late afternoon Saturday, with the numbers rising by almost 100,000 every couple of hours. Parliament considers debating all petitions that garner 100,000 signatures or more.
Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage, head of the UK Independence Party, was forced to acknowledge that the promise of a 350-million-pound weekly Brexit dividend — money the “Leave” campaign said could be spent on Britain’s National Health Service if it did not have to make contributions to the EU — was a chimera.
No one could guarantee where any such funds would go, he said on a nationwide morning-TV program: “That was one of the mistakes made by the Leave campaign.”
The county of Cornwall at England’s far southwestern tip, where 56.5% of voters cast ballots to leave the EU, said it now fears losing 60 million pounds a year in EU aid as an economically disadvantaged region. “We will be taking urgent steps to ensure that the U.K. government protects Cornwall’s position in any negotiations,” the county council said in demanding that the government make up the loss.
The possible financial effects of the split also were becoming clear.
Moody’s Investor Service, after lowering its outlook on British sovereign debt from “stable” to “negative,” warned that the vote to exit the European Union “will herald a prolonged period of uncertainty for the U.K.”
It also could result in “diminished confidence and lower spending and investment, threatening the U.K.’s growth prospects,” the rating agency warned.
The vote in Britain brought renewed recognition of the country’s deep political and social cleavages, both generational and geographical. About 75% of Britons ages 18 to 24 voted to stay in the EU, while more than 50% of those 65 and older voted to leave. Scotland voted to stay by 62% to 38%, and Northern Ireland by 56% to 44%. London and its immediate suburbs voted about 60% in favor of staying in the EU, but outside London, nearly 60% of voters in England favored leaving.
These figures point to what may be the most important political risk presented by the vote: changes in the structure of Britain, or even its dissolution. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wasted little time after the results were in to announce she would seek “immediate discussions” with the EU to “protect Scotland’s place” in the union.
She also said a second referendum on Scottish independence is now “highly likely.” A 2014 referendum on independence lost 55% to 44%.
Educational achievement correlated closely with the vote, as those with limited education voted to leave, while those with university degrees favored staying. Working-class voters tended to vote to leave, a signal of the widening discontent over globalization that politicians and policymakers throughout the developed world will have to consider. Feelings are strong among less-skilled and educated workers who have been denied the benefits of globalization or the opportunities for retraining in the new economy that have long been promised to them.
European leaders, in urging a speedy processing of the split, were reacting in part to British Prime Minister David Cameron’s decision to resign after the vote, but not necessarily before his Conservative Party conference in October. Since the negotiations would be conducted by Cameron’s successor, his decision potentially extends the uncertainties about the terms and timing of the split for months.
Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, was echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who called Britain’s breakaway “not an amicable divorce” and called for negotiations to begin “immediately.”
Those EU leaders plainly are worried that drawn-out departure negotiations will encourage other countries unhappy with their relationship with the union to plot their own withdrawals. A swift and stringent negotiation, however, would make clear the consequences of leaving.
Meanwhile, some leaders of the Brexit campaign have started to quail at the political and administrative chaos introduced by Thursday’s vote. Boris Johnson, a Tory member of Parliament and former mayor of London who had tied his political fortunes to the Leave campaign, said at a news conference Friday that there was “no need for haste” in following through on the vote.
“Nothing will change in the short term,” said Johnson, who is expected to vie to succeed Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister.
The actual mechanism of the British-EU divorce is nebulous. It’s based on Article 50 of the EU’s 2007 Lisbon Treaty, which recognizes the right of member nations to withdraw, but gives only vague guidelines for the process — possibly because the EU was in such an expansionist mind-set at the time that the possibility of a withdrawal was not taken seriously.
Article 50 calls for a two-year negotiation period over terms of the split after it’s invoked but doesn’t regulate when the invocation must take place. In Britain, despite the referendum, that decision is up to the government.
But political observers in Britain and Brussels still believe that the unexpectedly high voter turnout of more than 72%, along with the decisive 52%-48% outcome, suggest that Parliament received a clear directive to pursue Brexit, despite the demographic and geographical splits.
“Parliament has supreme authority, but it is highly unlikely to reverse the mandate delivered by the voters,” Nicolas Veron of the Brussels think tank Bruegel wrote Saturday.
Of course, the nearly 2 million signatures attached to the petition for a second vote is still a pittance compared with the 17.4 million voters who opted to leave.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-terror-2017-story.html;2017-01-22;A terrorist attack in Germany could have hurt Angela Merkel politically. So far, it hasn't - Los Angeles Times;"Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Berlin held that a major terrorist attack attributed to one of the more than 1 million refugees and migrants allowed into Germany since mid-2015 would spell doom for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who faces a reelection bid in September.
Then, on Dec. 19, just such an attack occurred. A man plowed a stolen truck into a crowded outdoor Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. Police sought a suspect who, they said, was a Tunisian refugee who had sought asylum in Germany. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
And then an odd thing happened.
Merkel’s popularity did not fall off a cliff. In fact, it has remained high in the month since the attack, and her reelection chances now seem brighter than ever. Although President Trump said she had made a “catastrophic mistake” by letting in so many refugees, there is little such rhetoric in Germany. Only the far-right German fringe has said Merkel had “blood on her hands” for the attack.
Germans have remained remarkably stoic and without any signs of panic or lust for revenge in the face of the worst terrorist attack to hit the country since a Palestinian group massacred 12 Israelis and a West German police officer at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Although much could change between now and September, opinion polls point to a fourth election win for Merkel, and pollsters say most Germans seem confident that her government is doing all it can to protect them.
A solemn and stunned Merkel made repeated visits to the site of the truck attack in the heart of west Berlin, often accompanied by her interior minister, justice minister and the mayor of Berlin. Even before it was clear that a refugee was suspected, she directly addressed the question of such a perfidious attack by a refugee Germany was trying to help.
“It’s hard for us to understand that the person who did this came to Germany in search of protection and asylum, if that’s confirmed,” Merkel said when the responsibility was still unclear on the day after the attack. “That would be especially sickening for all of those in Germany helping refugees and for those who came here to be protected and integrate themselves.”

It was also somehow reassuring to Germans to later learn that authorities had the suspect, Anis Amri, on their radar. That helped tranquilize fears in a country that cherishes order more than almost anything else. Many had been aghast when Merkel suspended all border controls for a few tumultuous months in late 2015 to allow in a million refugees with at most cursory background checks.
“Merkel and her allies have managed to convince the public that the terror attack in Berlin and the million refugees coming in are two completely separate and unrelated issues,” said Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “Germans can be extremely rational and they generally accepted that narrative. They yearn for calming leadership and they’ve got faith that she’ll find the appropriate answers to prevent it from happening again.”
After several smaller and partially bungled attacks in mid-2016 by Syrian and Afghan asylum-seekers in which only the assailants lost their lives, the December attack in Berlin shocked the country out of its complacency. Germany had for the most part been largely oblivious to the threat and fears that had plagued neighboring countries such as France and Belgium. Polls showed fear of terrorist attacks in Germany was far lower than in those neighboring countries, and Germans did not change their habits in response to attacks.
Amri, the 24-year-old suspect, had failed to obtain asylum in Germany after arriving in June 2015 from Italy and was on a list to be deported to Tunisia. But because he did not have a Tunisian passport and Tunisia at first denied he was a citizen, Amri was allowed to stay even though police kept him on a watchlist and under surveillance for months after he was linked to radical Islamists.
Amri was ultimately killed in a shootout with police in Milan, Italy. But the emergence of the disturbing details about police handling of his case, and his ability to slip between the cracks of competing state jurisdictions, has also helped Merkel, analysts believe, because few blame her for such ineptitude.
“The responsibility for the attack was spread around on a lot of different shoulders and so it didn’t all end up on Merkel,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University. “She also succeeded in turning the postmortem into technical questions, rather than political questions, such as why wasn’t he arrested before if he was under surveillance? And why wasn’t he deported to Tunisia?”
Indeed, many argue that Germany’s built-in security safeguards, designed to filter out a “threat to the state,” as Amri was labeled, are largely working. German authorities have identified some 500 such threats to the state, about half of whom are living in Germany; the other half are fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Many of those in Germany have been placed under surveillance and others are in jail. State and federal authorities share their intelligence across Germany and throughout Europe — one of the important lessons learned in the wake of the 2016 attacks in Brussels, where a breakdown in information-sharing played a key role.
“There’s a large majority in Germany of people who say, ‘No, Merkel can’t be blamed for the terror attack,’” said Peter Matuschek, head of political research at the Forsa polling institute. The respected Forsa poll has found that Merkel’s popularity has risen slightly since December, as has support for her conservative party. Only 28% of German voters see a connection between the refugees and the terrorist threat, and 68% believe there is no link, according to Forsa.
“It’s quite clear that Germans have been calm and collected despite the attack,” Matuschek said. “There’s been no shift in support to the far-right parties. No shift away from Merkel. Hardly anyone has changed the way they do things, hardly anyone is doing anything any differently and there seems to be a prevailing sense of: Let’s not let this change our way of life.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-obama-merkel-20160425-story.html;2016-04-25;President Obama and German leader Angela Merkel share a deep bond, aides say  - Los Angeles Times;"In London, it was a sight with long historical precedent: an American president and a British prime minister showing personal rapport as they tended to the long-running “special relationship” between their countries.
“I’ve always found Barack someone who gives sage advice,” said David Cameron, the conservative prime minister. “He’s a man with a very good heart and has been a very good friend.”
At a joint news conference, Cameron and Obama reminisced about basketball, table tennis and barbecues; a day later the pair agonized over their misfortune on the golf course.
Here in Hanover on Sunday, a different scene emerged as German Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked to recount the ups and downs of her time with Obama.
“We’re actually quite busy with the conflicts that we need to solve in the world,” she said, brushing off the question. “I am not in position to take stock today.”
Obama’s bond with Merkel often has seemed as transactional as the one with Cameron is chummy. But as the only leader of a major ally whose tenure has spanned Obama’s presidency, aides say they share a deep bond that has allowed them to weather domestic and global storms, and even clashes with each other.
“This is as important a relationship as I’ve had during the course of my presidency,” Obama said Sunday, describing Merkel as consistent, steady and trustworthy.
They may not demonstrate overt personal chemistry but in some ways, according to a senior administration official, they are more compatible than Obama is with other leaders. Both are cool, deliberate and interested in finding solutions.

As Merkel responded in detail to a question about resolving the Syria quagmire Sunday, Obama at one point looked at her admiringly and nodded vigorously at the argument she made.
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild that was published before his arrival, Obama said that he has learned from Merkel over the years and that she embodies the leadership qualities he admired most, particularly her pragmatism.
“When she says something, she means it. When she says she’ll do something, she does it,” he said. “I trust her. And when there have been bumps in the bilateral relationship, as there inevitably are between any two countries, we’ve worked through them together as partners, with mutual respect.”
That Merkel invited Obama for his fifth visit suggests strains have eased since the dark days of October 2013, when leaks from fugitive Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had been eavesdropping on Merkel’s telephone calls for at least three years.
Merkel was furious and Obama, who was embarrassed, later said he had ended the intelligence-gathering operation.
Merkel had her doubts about Obama early on, at least according to comments attributed to a former U.S. ambassador to Germany that were related to Hillary Clinton by her longtime confidant Sidney Blumenthal.
“She dislikes the atmospherics surrounding the Obama phenomenon, that it’s contrary to her whole idea of politics and how to conduct oneself in general,” Blumenthal wrote in an email made public by the State Department last year.
But the two leaders quickly found common ground.
As head of Europe’s largest and most stable economy, Merkel was an essential partner in Obama’s efforts to help steady the global economy after the recession. The administration also worked closely with Germany on emerging security threats.
In 2011, heading into his reelection year, the president feted Merkel with a Rose Garden state dinner. He awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, tracing her path in Cold War East Germany to becoming the world’s most powerful woman.
Merkel now is eyeing Obama to buttress her political standing after fallout from the Syrian refugee crisis cost her party in recent regional elections. Before Obama arrived, she visited refugee camps in Turkey and helped broker a deal in which the Turkish government agreed to resettle refugees who had fled to Western Europe, particularly Germany.
Before Obama left Washington, the White House flatly said Obama wanted “to provide political support to her.” He did that Sunday at their news conference, responding both to her critics at home and to Donald Trump’s attack on her refugee policies as “insane.”
“She is on the right side of history on this,” Obama said. “She is giving voice I think to the kinds of principles that bring people together rather than divide them, and I’m very proud of her for that, and I’m proud of the German people for that.”
Merkel refused to even consider a question about a prospective President Trump, saying she was “quite busy” with more immediate demands.
During Obama’s two-day visit, he and Merkel will be joined by Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for a discussion of developments in Syria, the migration crisis and joint operations against Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
With efforts to forge a transatlantic trade deal sputtering, Obama and Merkel sought to present a united front at one of the largest international trade shows, the Hanover Fair. Protests outside the fair focused on the trade deal.
Obama told reporters that he is confident talks on a European trade deal could be revived and completed by year’s end, attributing the U.S. opposition to the heat of an election campaign.

It was British-made, weighing about 275 pounds, presumably dropped during the war by the Royal Air Force — just one small remnant of the 2.7 million tons of explosives dropped by the British and the Americans on Europe between 1940 and 1945, half of which fell on Germany.
As many as 1 in 10 of those bombs failed to explode on impact and year after year they still surface, dangerous until they are defused or carefully detonated.
In that way, at least, the war continues to this day.
Opinion Columnist
Nicholas Goldberg
Nicholas Goldberg served 11 years as editor of the editorial page and is a former editor of the Op-Ed page and Sunday Opinion section.
The discovery of the bomb seemed like a fitting metaphor because war is on everyone’s mind these days in Germany and across Europe. And it’s not always the immediate war in Ukraine either. Just as often, it’s the Second World War and what it means for Ukraine, or World War I and its needless carnage and what that means for Ukraine. Or the march of Napoleon and his army from Paris to Moscow in the early 19th century, and what that means for Ukraine.
It’s no wonder Europeans can’t stop thinking about the past. Today’s war has such clear echoes of those previous conflicts, in which disputes over territory, power, resources, nationality, ethnicity and religion led to so much death and destruction on the continent for so many centuries.
In the United States, we are notoriously ignorant or forgetful of such history. Six in 10 Americans can’t even name the countries we fought against in World War II, according to a 2018 survey.
World & Nation
In heavily bombarded Kharkiv, a Ukrainian soldier guards what’s left of a landmark building. ‘We unite and fight back,’ he says.

But in Europe, distances are shorter — it’s not much more than eight hours by car from eastern Germany to the Ukrainian border — and memories are longer. As battles rage in Mariupol and Kyiv and Kharkiv, Europeans could be forgiven for wondering whether the past is actually past at all.

Unsurprisingly, the subject of World War II was broached repeatedly during my visit. Discussions of Putin frequently led back to Hitler and Stalin; talk of Russia’s military aggression beyond its borders conjured German Lebensraum.
We talked about Germany’s post-1945 pacifist zeitgeist and the government’s recent decision to increase military spending in light of events in Ukraine.
In our house, there was a particular focus on the expansion of NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union. My father — an American expat who has lived in Germany for more than 40 years — believes that it was needlessly provocative to Russia, just as the Treaty of Versailles had been to the Germans before the Second World War. A Putin response was predictable, he says, though not justifiable. Others disagreed, saying NATO’s expansion into Eastern Europe was necessary to protect those countries (including small ones like Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania) from Russian bullying and resubjugation.
Politics
In Russia’s war in Ukraine, investigators are able to collect evidence of war crimes “in real time,” lawyers and experts say, giving hope of more timely justice.

On the streets in Germany, reminders of the last war were, as always, hard to avoid.
In the university town of Darmstadt, for instance, I saw a young man crouched near the ground polishing, or perhaps installing, a group of Stolpersteine, the small metal “stumbling stones” set into the sidewalks to mark the former homes of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution.
There are now tens of thousands of these small brass plaques throughout the country — designed, of course, to keep alive the memory of the war and the Holocaust, as one step toward never repeating it.
That’s more necessary than ever because firsthand memories of World War II are fading away. You have to be close to 90 years old now to have clear recollections; soon, victims and perpetrators alike will be gone, and memories will be indirect, passed down through the generations and even more myth-filled than they already are.
My father and his  wife, who is German, remember the war, though they are now the exception, not the rule.
World & Nation
Patriarch Kirill, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, has lent a spiritual justification for the war in Ukraine.

The Germans I spoke with favored Western support for Ukraine’s defense. But I also heard nagging doubts about the role of the United States.
The trans-Atlantic partnership, built during the Cold War years that followed World War II, has been under strain in recent years. Germans, like other Europeans, were upset first by the excesses of the Bush administration’s war on terror, and then the Trump administration’s “America First” policy and its lukewarm commitment to European security. One person I spoke to questioned American credibility, criticizing President Obama for failing to follow through in 2013 on the “red line” he seemed to have set for Syria’s Bashar Assad if he used chemical weapons against his own people.
Add to those concerns a bit of national uncertainty in the wake of the departure of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was a steady hand and a trusted leader, plus the the woes of the European Union in recent years — including Brexit — and a measure of anxiety is understandable.
On the other hand, the bomb near our house was rendered harmless in a controlled detonation, with no injuries. There’s that to celebrate at an uneasy time in Europe’s history.

On German TV talk shows, he is composed and soft-spoken as he speaks impeccable German. Patiently, he explains why Ukraine deserves more weapons and why Germany should exert more pressure on Moscow to end its invasion.
On Twitter, however, he is far less diplomatic, reacting with wrath anytime he detects German hypocrisy toward Russia, such as when he received an invite to a Ukraine solidarity concert for last Sunday  at Bellevue  Palace, the residence of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
“There are only Russian soloists performing, no Ukrainians,” he tweeted in capital letters. “In the midst of a war against civilians. This is an affront. Sorry, I will stay away!!”
The office of the president responded by expressing regrets that the ambassador would not attend. That, however, did not soothe Melnyk, 46.
“My dear God,” he replied, “why is it so hard for the German president to realize that as long as Russian bombs are falling on Ukrainian cities and thousands of civilians are being murdered day and night, we Ukrainians don’t have any stomach for ‘great Russian culture.’”

World & Nation
Biden’s order to release of 1 million barrels of oil a day from U.S. reserve is a bid to control prices that have spiked after sanctions on Russia.

The exchange, Melnyk reflects, epitomizes the duality of attitudes that some leading German officials continue to maintain toward Moscow as its troops and missiles pummel Ukraine more than a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked war.
While Germany has acted in concert with the U.S. and its other fellow NATO members in providing arms to Ukraine and scaling back most trade with Russia, Melnyk suggests that there is more than missing tact and sensitivity when it comes to leaders such as Steinmeier.

There remains, he suspects, a thinly disguised affection for Russia that has not, or cannot, be overcome.
“The president of Germany is not ready to admit any of his huge personal responsibility for the failure of Berlin’s Russia policy mistake,” he said in an interview. “Even in times of such a war he wants to build new bridges with Russia. It clearly sends a clandestine signal to Moscow: Once the war is over we are still here. We keep the flag flying. We will restore the German-Russian historic ties.”
Steinmeier, twice a German foreign minister and a longtime confidant of former chancellor and Nord Stream 2 pipeline executive Gerhard Schröder, has for years been seen as one of the architects of Germany’s  cozy relations with Russia. He brokered a peace agreement, dubbed the “Steinmeier formula” between Russia and Ukraine’s former Moscow-friendly administration after Putin’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region.
For years Steinmeier could be sure that his soft stance on Russia had the support of the German political establishment. The mantra “No peace in Europe without Russia’’ was a predominant guideline of Berlin’s foreign policy.
Following the line meant frequently looking the other way at Putin’s suppression of political opponents and the media, and his support of Syrian President Bashar  Assad in bombing his own cities with Russian air assistance.
It was not until 2020 when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel turned a corner, helping Putin critic  Alexei Navalny receive medical assistance in Germany after his presumed poisoning by Russian intelligence agents.
Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a high-profile politician of the liberal party FDP that is part of the ruling coalition, summed up Germany’s past policies in bitter words.
Putin’s war was “a very harsh awakening for Europe and especially for us,” she said in an interview with the German news agency dpa. “I think appeasement, which is a policy of constant tolerance of destructive power politics, has completely failed.”
After Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in late February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Berlin would finally send weapons to Ukraine and prop up his own underfunded military.
German weapons have since begun slowly trickling in, and on Thursday, a Ukrainian delegation spearheaded by former boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko, the brother of Kyiv’s mayor, arrived in Berlin to negotiate more deliveries.
Bolstering the German army also seems slow going. Behind the scenes there is a fight brewing over the wording of a law for a 100-billion euro expenditure. Rather than spending the money as initially promised on the army, the government now wants the funds to generally “strengthen alliance and defense capabilities.” Ongoing haggling is indicative that the Russia-friendly political wing, as well as the German peace movement that makes up influential parts of the governing Social Democrats and Greens, may not stay silent.
A recent survey by the Körber-Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Hamburg, seems to back up the sentiment. Although Germany’s foreign policy has 67% support,  76% of the public still seeks more independence from U.S. interests. Even now, 14% of Germans consider close relations with Russia to be more important than with the U.S.
A cornerstone of German’s tight relationship with Russia has been its reliance on Russian energy sources — more than half of the natural gas consumed in Germany comes via Russia.
Now this dependence has turned into a significant disadvantage. While shutting off a new Nord Stream pipeline, Russia still relies on gas deliveries via other sources, including the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which also supplies several other European nations.
In a new twist on the gas issue, Putin threatened to turn off the gas supply to countries deemed “unfriendly” such as Germany if they did not pay in rubles. But on Thursday, he said that such countries must open special accounts at Gazprombank to pay for Russian gas and the bank would then buy rubles on behalf of the buyers to transfer payments in Russian currency to another special account.
The Ukrainian ambassador remains less than optimistic about the future.
“On the societal level, people better understand that this war may affect them. And they are more than ready to help,” he said.
Indeed, in the last month, German individuals and private institutions have donated several hundred million euros for Ukraine; volunteers  collected food, clothes and medicines, hired buses and drove to the Polish-Ukrainian border to bring refugees to safety in Germany.

“But as the first shock subsides, politics has again become sluggish,” Melnyk contends.
The ambassador, probably one of the most disliked men in Berlin diplomatic circles because of his blunt style, wants Germans to look in the mirror.
“Ukraine needs much more weapons from Germany, has to increase the economic pressure on Russia and sanctions have to be considerably increased,” he said. “Instead, it seems to me as if many in the government still think that Russia will win this war — and that it does not pay off to take too much of a stand in favor of Ukraine.”
In another tweet, he posted an image of Ukrainian kids huddled together in a makeshift bomb shelter. The caption read, “Dear Federal Government! This is how millions of Ukrainian children sleep. In basements. Under Russian missile fire. You can end this horror immediately by an import ban on gas, oil, coal, metals and other raw materials. Have a good night.”

Time also cited Merkel’s strong response to “Vladimir Putin’s creeping theft of Ukraine” and on its cover called her “Chancellor of the Free World.”
“Not once or twice but three times there has been reason to wonder this year whether Europe could continue to exist, not culturally or geographically but as a historic experiment in ambitious statecraft,” Time editor Nancy Gibbs wrote. “You can agree with her or not, but she is not taking the easy road. Leaders are tested only when people don’t want to follow. For asking more of her country than most politicians would dare, for standing firm against tyranny as well as expedience and for providing steadfast moral leadership in a world where it is in short supply, Angela Merkel is Time’s Person of the Year.”

Merkel, 61, is just the fourth woman since 1927 to be chosen for the distinction, and the first since opposition leader Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines in 1986. She is the first German since Willy Brandt, the West German chancellor named in 1970 for “seeking to bring about a fresh relationship between East and West” during the Cold War. In 1999, Time picked the German-born Albert Einstein as Person of the Century.
Wednesday’s news came in as Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert was leading a government news conference in the German capital, while Merkel herself was at an event in Leipzig. When asked about it by the Associated Press, Seibert said he had only just received word on his phone himself.
“I’m sure the chancellor will regard this as an encouragement for her political work, for a good future for Germany as well as for Europe,” Seibert said.
The other finalists included Donald Trump, who for months has topped Republican polls for the 2016 U.S. presidential election and dominated headlines.

“I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite,” he tweeted soon after Time’s announcement. “They picked person who is ruining Germany.”
The other candidates for 2015 were Caitlyn Jenner, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Black Lives Matter protest movement, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.

“The Russian leadership must know that if it continues to destabilize eastern Ukraine and disrupt this month’s presidential election, we will move quickly on additional steps, including further sanctions that will impose greater costs,” Obama said during a joint news conference in the Rose Garden.
After weeks of threatening to impose sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy, Obama and Merkel appeared to be refining the trigger point for enacting the tougher penalties that could cause pain to Europe as well as Russia. In previous remarks, Obama had only specified that the sanctions would come if Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine.
The new red line comes as violence in eastern Ukraine has increased with the fledgling government in Kiev struggling to subdue pro-Russian separatists. Western powers say Moscow is behind the insurgents and has broken its promise to urge them to stand down.
Talk of the U.S. and European response to the continuing crisis dominated Merkel’s brief visit to Washington on Friday. The two leaders sought to present a united front against Russia, despite the open rift between the nations on another hot topic -- U.S. spying.
Revelations that U.S. intelligence agencies listened in on Merkel’s phone calls have caused sustained tensions between Berlin and Washington. Attempts to craft a new agreement outlining the rules of the road for spying between U.S. and Germany have so far failed.
Merkel raised the issue in the news conference, noting that the two sides had not yet reached a deal and that the matter “will require further discussion.”
Obama sought to reassure German citizens that the U.S. is not vacuuming up all of their phone conversations and email correspondence, saying, “Ordinary Germans are not subject to continual surveillance.” He also pushed back on reports that the U.S. had offered and then rescinded a “no-spy agreement” to the French, which has angered Germans who have sought similar assurances.

“We do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country, with any of our closest partners,” Obama said, adding that the United States was working with various allies to address concerns that have arisen after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that disclosed the extent of U.S. spying.
The president also commented on a domestic controversy: the botched execution of a convicted murderer in Oklahoma. The incident has prompted a state investigation into death penalty procedures.
Obama, who supports capital punishment in some cases, said the Oklahoma execution raises “significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied” and said he had asked Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to produce a review of federal work on problems with the death penalty.
“I think we do have to, as a society, ask ourselves some difficult and profound questions around these issues,” Obama said.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-wn-ukraine-russia-tensions-20140501-story.html;2014-05-01;Merkel asks Putin's help in freeing European hostages in Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to urge him to use his influence with pro-Russia militants holding seven European military observers hostage in eastern Ukraine, official sources in Berlin and Moscow said.
But the Kremlin press service account of the phone call said Putin told Merkel that “the main thing” that needs to be done is for Ukraine’s interim government to withdraw its forces from the southeast regions of the country.
Putin also said officials in Kiev needed to “stop the violence and immediately open a broad national dialogue” on constitutional changes that would transfer authority from the Ukrainian capital to the regions. The latter demand has been pressed repeatedly by the Kremlin in the month since its allied militants have occupied about a dozen towns and cities in eastern Ukraine, ostensibly to defend the interests of the region’s Russian minority.
Masked and armed militants who seized the town of Slovyansk last month and declared the area part of the “People’s Republic of Donetsk” detained a delegation of military observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Friday as the group attempted to enter the town on a mission on behalf of the 57-nation group, which includes Ukraine and Russia.
The OSCE also has delegations of election monitors setting up observer operations for Ukraine’s May 25 presidential election, as well as more than 100 members of a special monitoring mission dispatched after Russian troops occupied Ukraine’s Crimea region in late February, which declared its independence after a hastily called referendum. Russia formally annexed Crimea last month, although the international community has condemned the move as an illegal.
The military monitors -- four Germans, a Swede, a Dane and a Pole -- were paraded by their captors last weekend in a news conference. The self-proclaimed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has told journalists that the captives can be freed in exchange for separatists arrested by Ukrainian police during operations aimed at regaining control of the occupied areas. Five Ukrainian military officers were also in the OSCE delegation and were detained along with the Europeans, although the militants haven’t disclosed their whereabouts or circumstances. The militants also hold Ukrainian and foreign journalists and Ukrainian activists pushing for unity in defiance of the separatists.
Kremlin officials, including Putin, have denied orchestrating the militancy in eastern Ukraine and feign inability to compel the gunmen to cease their disruptions.
Merkel “appealed to the president to use his influence” in resolving the standoff over the OSCE team, said Christiane Wirtz, a spokeswoman for the chancellor.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, winding up a Latin America trip in Lima, Peru, on Wednesday, called for OSCE to oversee negotiations between the Kiev government and its “opponents” to resolve issues of concern to “our regions,” referring to the Russian-speaking communities of southern and eastern Ukraine.
“We hope that our partners, our Western colleagues, will let the Ukrainians establish this dialogue without major impediments,” Lavrov said, according to the Associated Press.
Lavrov and other top Kremlin officials have cast the confrontations roiling eastern Ukraine as the result of Western meddling and support for what were opposition politicians before the Feb. 21 ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Russian officials condemn the interim government as illegitimate and point to the spreading unrest in the east as evidence of Kiev’s inability to effectively manage the country. The interim leaders in Kiev accuse the Kremlin of orchestrating the separatist turmoil to prevent or at least undermine a free and fair vote for a new Ukrainian president in little more than three weeks.
“Ukraine’s ability to hold a credible election clearly is going to be tremendously difficult,” said Olga Oliker, a senior international policy analyst at Rand Corp. whose expertise is in Russian foreign relations and military capabilities.
But Russia’s membership in the OSCE and its tacit approval of the election monitoring mission suggests there may be sufficient observation of the presidential vote to bestow its legitimacy, Oliker said.
Opinion polls in the volatile eastern and southern regions of Ukraine suggest the population is largely opposed to Russian intervention or a breakup of Ukraine into pro-Russia and pro-Europe enclaves, Oliker said.
“The people of southern and eastern Ukraine do want legitimate government in Kiev and will come out and vote if they think they can do so safely and securely,” she said, adding that the expected presence of OSCE and other international observers should have “a certain effect in deterring bad behavior.”

https://www.latimes.com/nation/sns-tns-bc-europe-migrants-merkel-20150916-story.html;2015-09-16;Merkel's image goes from harsh to heroine in a few short weeks - Los Angeles Times;"BERLIN The chant began when the refugees, having reached Germany and been assigned to wait for their asylum requests to be vetted in the north of the country, decided they wanted to move through Denmark, on to family or friends they’d heard had found good lives in Sweden.
The refugees sat on and around the train tracks in Luebeck and began intoning, “Mother Merkel, come and help us. Mother Merkel, come and save us.”
They were referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose name has long been a common chant for protesters across Europe.
But now they are unabashedly full of praise, and even love, for her. It’s a startling transformation for a politician and a country that just months ago was vilified for having pushed Greece and Europe to the crisis point by insisting on loan repayments and austerity.
“The depiction of Merkel, the depiction of Germany as a whole, even three or four months ago, was cruel and inhumane,” said Joerg Wolf, editor in chief at the Berlin think tank The Atlantic Initiative. “That hit a nerve. I think that led to what we call today the Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture). We were tired of being the bad guys. The chancellor was tired of being the villain.”
Since Merkel made a point of saying that it is a both a duty and an honor for Germany to welcome those fleeing war in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, the world’s most powerful woman has been portrayed in almost religious terms. Her nation could take in as many as 500,000 asylum seekers and possibly a million refugees this year. Her welcoming attitude comes at a time when many in Europe want to close the gates more tightly.
There are almost countless collages on social media sites depicting “compassionate Mother Merkel.” One popular tribute shows her in bishop’s robes, holding a cross, above a caption in Arabic urging refugees to “Go to Merkel, because she is fair and does no harm to any human.”
Another takes a photo of Merkel while she was swearing the oath of office in Germany, though the words she spoke have been replaced by the caption, “By God Almighty: I will protect all Syrians.”

Another that has been forwarded countless times shows her standing with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She, the German and Christian, holds a glass of beer. Erdogan, the Turk and Muslim, holds a Quran. The caption beneath them asks: “Why does Erdogan not protect us although he is Muslim. Why does Merkel help us although she is not Muslim?”
In yet another popular meme on social media sites, her photo is shown with a collection of Middle Eastern heads of state. The caption reads: “One woman is worth more than all these men.”
The Guardian newspaper reported that refugees were naming their newborns after her.
For those who follow European politics, there is great irony in this new image of the German leader. During the past several years of the Greek financial crisis, Merkel had come to symbolize the uncaring tyrant. Instead of the current crop of photos depicting her as benevolent, her image had been altered to look like Adolf Hitler.
The Greeks put forth a case that she was destroying their national economy without a care for the human cost. But today, even some of her most ferocious critics appear to be backing off a bit.
Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, known for being brutal in his criticism of Germany and Merkel, wrote in a piece for the highly respected Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that Merkel and the Germans “are proving to be true heirs of Immanuel Kant and are acting in accordance with the categorical imperative.”
From an academic, that’s a compliment. He even went on to note that “Europe needs the moral leadership of Germany.”

Not all Germans are so enamored with their chancellor’s new, friendlier image. Anti-refugee protesters call her a traitor and even a slut. Commentators on her Facebook page claim she “sentenced the future of Germans to death over the last few days” and call her “a peril for the German nation and our economy!”
It’s all quite a change from someone derisively referred to as “Mutti” (a nice but unhip Mom). The nickname was in reference to her often frumpy appearance, grumpy demeanor and budget-conscious approach to life. She was known for doing her own grocery shopping, carefully picking through the red peppers and plums, crawling on the ground to find her favorite pickles, even lining up to get the refund on her plastic bottles.
The German attitude was that if the issue required bold action, she would wait for others to act, then check the polls.
To date, her most memorable action in office might well be her decision to shut down all of Germany’s nuclear power stations.
Now, as Der Spiegel magazine notes, “Suddenly, she’s the refugee chancellor.”
As Wolf noted, “it is quite impressive how quickly she flipped her narrative, how quickly the narrative on Germany flipped from cruel to compassionate. Germans very much like this change. Germans like to be liked. Of course, it’s also understood that what has so quickly flipped in one direction can flip back.”

Merkel, 59, fell during her annual ski vacation to eastern Switzerland’s Engadine Valley, which includes the St. Moritz resort, and initially thought she had just suffered a bruise, said spokesman Steffen Seibert.

Merkel consulted her doctor on Friday, after returning to the German capital, and was told she had sustained a pelvic fracture.

The injury “makes it necessary for her to lie down a lot for three weeks and to use a walking aid,” Seibert said of the chancellor, who has experience on crutches following knee surgery three years ago.
Her doctor also advised her against air travel, prompting Merkel to postpone a planned Wednesday visit to Poland, Seibert said. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel was expected in Berlin on Thursday, but that meeting has also been put off, the spokesman said.
Merkel does plan to attend the inaugural gathering of her new coalition government on Wednesday. Because her conservative Christian Democratic Union failed to win an outright majority in elections last year, she was forced to enter into a grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and will meet with the new Cabinet in spite of her injury, Seibert said.

Merkel is the second prominent German to be injured in a skiing accident over the holiday season. On Dec. 29, Formula One racing ace Michael Schumacher suffered a serious head injury while downhill skiing with his son at the Meribel resort in the French Alps. He remains in a medically induced coma at a hospital in Grenoble.

https://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-germany-angela-merkel-government-coalition-20131127-story.html;2013-11-27;Merkel's conservatives strike power-sharing deal with German rivals - Los Angeles Times;"LONDON -- More than two months after voters cast their ballots, Germany took a major step toward finally forming a government Wednesday after leaders of the main political parties agreed on a common agenda that Chancellor Angela Merkel said would solidify her country’s sound financial position and promote social welfare.
The deal paves the way for Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, and its archrival, the center-left Social Democrats, to unite in a “grand coalition” overseeing Europe’s strongest economy.
But the political uncertainty that has prevailed since Germany’s Sept. 22 election is not entirely over. The power-sharing agreement has to be ratified by a mid-December vote of the Social Democratic Party’s 470,000 members, who could yet spurn the idea of joining forces with their nemeses.
Leaders expressed hope that the fruit of their marathon negotiations over the last several weeks would prove acceptable to the rank and file on both sides. If so, that would see the installation of Merkel, Germany’s most popular politician, in her third term as chancellor, serving until 2017. She took up the post in 2005.
“The spirit of this agreement shows that we are a grand coalition in order to deal with the grand tasks for Germany,” Merkel told reporters Wednesday, listing her priorities as “robust finances, robust prosperity and social security.”
The Christian Democrats were able to maintain their pledge not to raise taxes, despite Social Democrats’ demand during the election campaign that the rich pay more into the public purse. The coalition deal also throws a sop to the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, by proposing a highway toll for foreigners, which could fall afoul of European Union rules.
The Social Democrats were able to win some concessions of their own, foremost of which is agreement to introduce a national minimum wage, set at 8.50 euros (about $11.50), beginning in 2015. Some pensions are also to be increased.
“The grand coalition has written a coalition agreement for the little people,” said Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the Social Democrat Party, or SPD.

Other Europeans might be disappointed by the joint agenda, which does not include any softening of Berlin’s approach to the euro debt crisis. Though Merkel reiterated her usual line that “Europe is indispensable for Germany,” her party insists on continued austerity in countries such as Greece and Portugal as the price of German financial assistance.
Gabriel, who is likely to become vice chancellor in a grand coalition, is taking a bit of a gamble with his plan to put the power-sharing deal to a grass-roots vote. The idea strengthened his hand in talks with the CDU, but if his party shoots down the agreement, his position as chairman could be fatally weakened, and Germans unhappy with the current uncertainty could blame the SPD for prolonging it.
Ratification by the Social Democrats’ rank and file is not assured. Many are leery of teaming up with their archrivals after what happened the last time they did so, during Merkel’s first term as chancellor. Voters who felt that the two big parties had become almost indistinguishable punished the SPD in 2009 with the party’s worst electoral result since World War II.
In September’s election, Merkel’s conservatives won the most seats in the Bundestag by far but fell short of a majority, forcing them to find a governing partner. She is believed to prefer a grand coalition with the Social Democrats, if only because the CDU is unlikely to reach agreement with the other parties, such as the Greens.
The business-friendly Free Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel’s last government, were ousted from Parliament for the first time in their history.

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-oct-12-ed-merkel12-story.html;2005-10-12;Merkel's moment - Los Angeles Times;"THE RESULTS ARE FINALLY IN, three weeks after inconclusive balloting, and Angela Merkel is set to become Germany’s next leader. It’s a historic milestone on two fronts: Merkel will be the Federal Republic’s first female chancellor, and she will be the first leader hailing from what was once communist East Germany. From this side of the Atlantic, the significance of her ascension is not only symbolic: Gerhard Schroeder’s departure from the scene removes a leader who did much to contribute to a deterioration of the pivotal German-American relationship.
Because no natural alliance of parties had a decisive majority of votes last month, Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union is paying a high price for the chancellor’s office. In exchange for Schroeder’s retirement, his ostensibly defeated Social Democratic Party has claimed eight of 14 government ministries, including foreign affairs and finance, in a “grand coalition.”
The new government will be under a great deal of pressure to reduce Germany’s double-digit unemployment rate and reignite economic growth. The challenge for Merkel is to turn this political power-sharing arrangement into an opportunity, not a liability. Can both parties unite to embrace changes that may prove painful in the short run, such as reductions in some of the government’s social benefits? Or does their collaboration ensure that no real reform will take place?
In the international arena, Merkel is keen to improve ties with Washington that were frayed over the Iraq war; Schroeder opportunistically opposed any united front against Saddam Hussein as early as the summer of 2002. Merkel also will be less beholden to French President Jacques Chirac and more amenable to supporting Britain on some intra-European disputes.
Merkel’s past opposition to Turkish membership in the European Union is more worrisome, and she should not be tempted as chancellor to play the anti-immigrant card that is so popular among her more conservative supporters. Her relations with Muslims, both at home and abroad, will be an important barometer of the new leader’s growth on the job.
Still, for now, it is worth lingering on the historic wonder of a 51-year-old female physicist raised behind the Iron Curtain assuming the top job in Europe’s largest democracy."

Germany has now gone nearly a month without a proper government since voters went to the polls Sept. 22. Merkel emerged triumphant from the election with a mandate for a third term, but her conservative bloc fell a handful of seats short of a majority in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.

Since then, Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, has been engaged in delicate power-sharing talks with other parties. After several hours of negotiations through the evening Tuesday, the ecologically minded Green Party announced early Wednesday that it had decided against throwing in its lot with the CDU to form a new government.

Claudia Roth, the chairwoman of the Green Party, said the two sides had “discussed all the points from A to Z in depth” but that the gulf between them remained too wide. The parties disagree on such issues as healthcare reform and tax hikes on the rich.

That leaves Merkel with little choice but to keep bargaining with the party that finished in second place in the election, the center-left Social Democratic Party, or SDP. A new round of talks between officials of the two parties is scheduled for Thursday.

Although surveys show most Germans in favor of a “grand coalition” bringing together the two big parties of the right and left, the Social Democrats are leery of such an awkward marriage of convenience. The last time they entered into coalition with Merkel, during her first term as chancellor, they were given a drubbing at the polls by voters who saw little to distinguish the SDP from its historic archrival.

The Social Democrats are likely to demand major concessions, such as support for a national minimum wage, from Merkel’s conservatives in return for joining her government.

Although Merkel enjoys high personal approval ratings among the public and her party won more seats in the Bundestag last month than in 2009, her room for maneuvering is constrained because the business-friendly Free Democrats, her former coalition partner, were completely shut out of parliament. That has made Merkel’s CDU virtually the only conservative party still standing, and forced her to seek a governing partner from the left.


Negotiations are expected to drag on for several more days -- possibly weeks -- despite deep anxiety in other European quarters over German inaction at a time when the region’s debt problems remain a source of concern and its economic recovery fragile. The effort to stitch together a grand coalition in 2005 took two months.

In an embarrassing setback for Merkel, it emerged this week that the family behind the BMW car company had given her party the equivalent of about $932,000 just as her administration was lobbying other European countries to block higher emissions standards for big cars.

At a meeting of European Union environment ministers Monday, German officials managed to persuade fellow European Union members to water down the standards. On Tuesday, the Bundestag revealed that the wealthy Quandt family, which owns a controlling stake in BMW, had made its large donation to the CDU just last week.

Merkel’s government denies any link between the money and its lobbying of EU ministers. But Juergen Trittin, a senior Green Party leader, blasted Merkel on Twitter, saying the Quandts had successfully bought her environmental policy.

That has made Merkel’s CDU virtually the only conservative party still standing, and forced her to seek a governing partner from the left.

Negotiations are expected to drag on for several more days -- possibly weeks -- despite deep anxiety in other European quarters over German inaction at a time when the region’s debt problems remain a source of concern and its economic recovery fragile. The effort to stitch together a grand coalition in 2005 took two months.
In an embarrassing setback for Merkel, it emerged this week that the family behind the BMW car company had given her party the equivalent of about $932,000 just as her administration was lobbying other European countries to block higher emissions standards for big cars.
At a meeting of European Union environment ministers Monday, German officials managed to persuade fellow European Union members to water down the standards. On Tuesday, the Bundestag revealed that the wealthy Quandt family, which owns a controlling stake in BMW, had made its large donation to the CDU just last week.
Merkel’s government denies any link between the money and its lobbying of EU ministers. But Juergen Trittin, a senior Green Party leader, blasted Merkel on Twitter, saying the Quandts had successfully bought her environmental policy.

Merkel’s jubilation over winning a third term as chancellor, which would extend her time in power to 12 years, gave way to the political reality that she still needs to find a junior party with which to govern. Despite garnering far more votes than that of any other group, Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union fell five seats short of a majority in the Bundestag.

Still, the strong performance emboldened Merkel to claim a mandate and to dismiss speculation that she might soften her approach to managing Europe’s long-running debt crisis. Ailing neighbors such as Spain and Greece, where more than half of all young people are out of work, have pleaded with Germany to ease its demand for unremitting austerity in exchange for financial help, but Merkel signaled that there would be no let-up.

“Our European policy course … will not change,” she said.

Germans generally credit Merkel with protecting them from the ill effects of the debt crisis. The fact that their economy, Europe’s largest, continues to grow and that unemployment has dwindled to near-record lows has fed a sense of well-being and satisfaction with Merkel’s leadership.

But she may yet have to relent on some issues at home in her search for a coalition partner. Her Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, was virtually the only conservative party left standing after Sunday’s election. In a stunning development, the pro-market Free Democrats, with whom Merkel has governed for the last four years, failed to clear the 5% vote threshold required to enter parliament, shutting them out of the Bundestag for the first time in more than 60 years.

Instead, Merkel will have to try to persuade either the left-leaning, second-place Social Democrats or the smaller Green Party to join her in government. The Social Democrats, which participated in a “grand coalition” during Merkel’s first term, are likely to insist that she moderate or drop her opposition to a national minimum wage or higher taxes on the rich.

“You’ll have to ask [the CDU] whether it’s ready to pay a price,” the Social Democrats’ party chairman, Sigmar Gabriel, told reporters. “The ball is with Merkel.”

Negotiations to form a new government could last weeks. In 2005, the CDU and the Social Democrats took two months to reach an agreement on governing together.


“Thoroughness goes before speed,” Merkel said of the talks -- a statement that also neatly sums up her leadership style.

If she completes another full four-year term, Merkel would eclipse the late Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s former prime minister, as Europe’s longest-serving female leader. Merkel, 59, would also become Germany’s longest-serving chancellor since Helmut Kohl, her onetime mentor, whom she turned against and replaced as leader of the CDU in 1998.

The balloting caps a race in which Merkel and her rivals traded barbs over a possible national minimum wage, higher taxes for the rich and Germany’s role in bailing out debt-ridden European countries.

But discussion of those issues was often drowned out by minor campaign controversies and ignored by residents generally satisfied with the status quo.

But her party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, is less popular than she is.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-germany-victory-day-20150510-story.html;2015-05-10;Merkel visit after parade boycott does little to mend rift with Russia - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the Kremlin on Sunday to pay respects to the millions of Soviet lives lost in World War II and to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence with pro-Russia separatists to end the deadly conflict in Ukraine.
But on the heels of a Western boycott of Russia’s massive Victory Day parade on Saturday, Merkel’s gesture appeared to do little to mend the rift that Moscow’s actions in Ukraine have inflicted on relations between Russia and the United States and Europe.
Putin accompanied Merkel in laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, then hosted her in the Kremlin for talks that were clearly dominated by the two sides’ stark differences over the legality of Russia’s annexing of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula last year.
At a brief news conference after their meeting, Putin appeared confident and unmoved by Merkel’s argument that the seizure of Crimea was in violation of international law. He reiterated Moscow’s claim that the predominantly Russian population had a right to vote for reunion with Russia after a “coup d’etat” in Kiev ousted the elected president in February 2014.
Merkel held her ground, urging Putin to use his influence with the separatists in eastern Ukraine to “restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of the neighboring country where more than 6,100, many of them civilians, have been killed in little more than a year of fighting. The Kremlin leader agreed to do what he could but stated that the fate of Ukraine is in the hands of the separatists and the Kiev government, not Russia.
Both leaders pledged support for the Feb. 12 peace plan brokered in the Belarus capital of Minsk by Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and diplomats of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But they conceded that the cease-fire and artillery pullback agreed to in the Minsk pact haven’t been honored by the combatants. Both described the diplomatic path out of the conflict as “difficult” but the only means of ending the bloodshed.
As Merkel and Putin talked, rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic announced plans for a celebratory march in the eastern Ukraine city on Monday, the first anniversary of a dubious vote for independence held less than two months after Russia annexed Crimea. The march will be followed by a concert in the central Lenin Square of Donetsk, the Tass news agency reported, quoting the mayor of the artillery-blasted city that was once home to a million residents.
The separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk, elected in November in unmonitored votes widely condemned as illegitimate, have declined to conform with the Minsk peace plan call for new local elections. Nor has the government in Kiev made any progress in adopting the constitutional changes called for by the accord to grant broader autonomy to the eastern regions where the Russian language is dominant but no longer accorded official status.

On Sunday, Donetsk government chief Andrei Purgin reiterated the separatists’ disregard for the peace plan in announcing that the region was “harmonizing” its laws with those of Russia in preparation for inclusion in Putin’s emerging Eurasian Economic Union. The Ukrainian government has entered into an association agreement with the European Union, with hopes of eventually gaining full membership.
Putin established the Eurasian union as an alternative to the EU, and he opposes having the European Union active in Russia’s traditional sphere of influence.
The meeting with Merkel was the last in a four-day whirlwind of diplomacy as Putin received many of the visiting heads of state and government who attended the Red Square parade, including the presidents of China, India, South Africa, Cuba, Serbia and a handful of former Soviet republics.
Putin brushed off the absence of the U.S. and Western European leaders, remarking before television cameras Saturday night that “everyone we wanted to see was here.”
He also told Czech President Milos Zeman, one of the few top European leaders to attend the parade, that the relationship trouble with the West wasn’t the fault of the Kremlin.
“It was not us who initiated the chill in relations with Europe, but I hope that thanks to politicians like you we will manage not only to revive them completely but to also move forward,” Putin told Zeman during their meeting Saturday.

Even her supporters admit she’s no soaring orator. A giant campaign billboard features a close-up of her hands, not her face.

But the owner of that patriotic jewelry and those hands with their fingertips pressed together looks poised to renew her claim as the world’s most powerful woman.

Germans go to the polls Sunday, and almost all indications are that Chancellor Angela Merkel will emerge with a third term as leader of Europe’s most populous nation and its biggest economy.

Which party she’ll have to govern with in the coalition remains a toss-up. But Merkel, 59, is almost certain to extend her streak as one of the longest-serving leaders currently in the West. Another term would boost her time in office to 12 years and introduce her to her third sitting U.S. president.

The country she heads is prosperous, comfortable and generally approving of her low-key, cautious style. She routinely polls as Germany’s most popular politician, credited with steering the nation safely through the choppy waters of the euro debt crisis. Where southern European economies are floundering, Germany’s mighty export machine continues to churn.

Her opponents say she lacks vision, but Merkel confounds them with her talent for making anodyne statements of little substance that somehow succeed in soothing her compatriots, who have nicknamed her “Mutti” – “Mommy.” (She has no children of her own.)

“I’m not saying in a Freudian way that Germans have a mother complex, but she does seem to put a lot of people at ease, and the record seems to justify that trust,” said Joerg Forbrig, an analyst with the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “She projects the sort of feeling, shared by most, that we’re doing rather well.”

Her calm, unruffled air has lulled voters into complacency, critics say, and turned this election into one of the dullest in recent memory, even though the outcome has serious implications far beyond Germany’s borders.


Europe’s debt crisis is quiet for now, but could flare up at any moment, triggered by political instability in Italy or by Greece’s ongoing problems. Economists urge Germany, the continent’s undisputed leader, to take bold steps to fix the situation – writing down more Greek debt, agreeing with Eurozone partners to jointly issued government bonds, signing up to radical banking reforms – but Merkel has clung to an incremental, at times ponderous, approach.

Here at home, a steep rise in energy prices has begun to worry German industry. Workers complain that wages have flattened and social inequality has increased, in spite of a low unemployment rate that inspires envy in this nation’s neighbors.

Yet the election has sparked little national discussion of the big issues. Instead, voters have been distracted by such sideshows as a widely derided proposal by the Green Party for public cafeterias to go meatless one day a week and a magazine cover showing Merkel’s main rival, Peer Steinbrueck, flipping the bird (he approved the photo).

Merkel’s party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, has built its campaign almost entirely around her, relying on personality rather than policy. The enormous billboard here in the German capital showing nothing but Merkel’s hands – joined together in a diamond shape, her trademark pose – is meant to assure voters that their future is safe in her care.

“At the moment, the ‘mother of the country’ [image] works OK,” said Martin Lodge, an expert on German politics at the London School of Economics. “But if Germany goes downhill in the next few years, she will quickly lose support.”

Polls consistently show the CDU leading the pack heading into Sunday’s election, well in front of Steinbrueck’s Social Democrats but without enough support to land a majority in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. That means Merkel would have to find coalition partners, as is the norm in German politics; she currently governs with the conservative Free Democrats.

It remains possible that a collection of left-leaning parties could come out on top at the ballot box and band together to snatch away Merkel’s keys to the chancellery. But analysts think that unlikely.

More probable, if the Free Democrats perform as badly as polls suggest they might, is a “grand coalition” like the one Merkel presided over in her first term, a marriage of convenience between the CDU and the Social Democrats. Steinbrueck himself served as Merkel’s finance minister then, but he has ruled out his, if not his party’s, participation in a repeat of that configuration.

Although many Germans appreciate Steinbrueck’s reputation as a straight shooter, his policy proposals – a national minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich – have failed to catch fire. More publicized have been his gaffes, including his statement that he would never pay less than $6.50 for a bottle of Pinot Grigio wine.

He has also had little success blasting Merkel for her response to the euro crisis, since his party voted in favor of every measure that she brought before the Bundestag to deal with it, including funding bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Steinbrueck, 66, and Merkel have generally avoided personal attacks during the campaign.

“They are treating each other with a lot of caution because they know they may have to work with each other,” said Forbrig, the German Marshall Fund analyst. “There seemed to be a lot of reluctance to go that last step of attacking because they may need each other.”

Most Germans, aware of their country’s disastrous experience with charismatic leaders, have responded positively to Merkel’s unpretentious, pragmatic, risk-averse style. During her one and only debate with Steinbrueck, at which her necklace stole the show and spawned its own Twitter account, she modestly and somewhat paradoxically described her government’s achievements as “relatively sensational.”

Her penchant for breaking down big problems into smaller, solvable parts is a holdover from her previous career as a scientist. She’s also not above some opportunistic poaching of her opponents’ policies to cater to popular opinion, such as her abrupt decision two years ago to shut down Germany’s nuclear power plants after she had previously vowed to keep them running.

Whether a third term would embolden her to broadcast a wider vision for Germany and Europe, or to push her country into the front ranks on the global diplomatic stage as she looks ahead to her legacy as Germany’s first-ever female leader, is unclear. Some Germans hope it will.

“She seems to be responding to developments rather than shaping developments,” Forbrig said. “She is the most powerful woman on Earth, and she leads one of the largest industrial countries in the world. There’s a need for German leadership.”

Merkel Hess has transformed a range of functional objects into clay, in the process generally canceling out their functionality. His buckets and other containers can still serve as vessels, but heavy and fragile ones compared with their lightweight, indestructible plastic models. Ceramic anvils take this inversion to a wonderfully oxymoronic extreme: Made initially out of stone but now commonly of steel, anvils exist to be hammered upon.

They are tools to facilitate the production of other objects, not objects generally valued or appreciated in themselves. Merkel Hess ennobles them, pays homage to their history and variety, and invites us to see them as pure form.

Isolated like this, as tabletop sculptures, they become curiously other: animate, weapon-like, elegant and elemental. Those with double horns resemble bulls, and those with only one suggest rhinos or some other ancient tusked creature.

However blocky and inert, their surfaces are alive with color and texture — a neon tangerine wash over gold, ivory dusted in ash, crater-pocked aqua and iridescent purple. One, glazed a glossy, gluey white, has two square eye holes that make it look like a hooded figure lifted from a Philip Guston painting.

This series is Merkel Hess at his devious and delightful best, making the familiar odd and new.

He entertains barely-of-age girls as overnight guests and brags about it. He appoints business cronies and television starlets to government jobs. He’s under perpetual investigation for corruption.
But voters in Berlusconi’s conservative base have always seemed willing to forgive him — until now. The prime minister survived a close vote in Parliament last week, but the talk in Italy is increasingly of how soon he will fall. Why, after all that’s come before, have Italians finally lost patience with Berlusconi? In part because he recently picked the wrong target to insult.
In a wiretapped conversation reported a few weeks ago, Berlusconi described Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, with a phrase too vulgar to be printed in this newspaper but that meant he considered her too unattractive to invite to his bed.
Bad move. Italy, whose government debt is 120% of its gross domestic product, needs Germany’s help — and Merkel’s protection — to avoid a run on its bonds. “We’re all hoping the Germans can figure out a way to get us out of this mess,” an Italian banker told me recently.
It’s not just Italy that finds itself needing Merkel and the Germans. Greece is already in a state of economic catastrophe; Spain and Portugal are on the brink. And Europe’s economic crisis has spread far beyond its inefficient southern economies to the banks in northern countries, such as Germany and France, that are holding those governments’ no-longer-reliable bonds. If banks in Frankfurt and Paris begin to fail, the continent could slide into another recession — and take the U.S. economy with it.
That has made Europe’s crisis bigger but, oddly enough, easier to fix, with considerable help from Merkel and her country. When it looked like a matter of bailing out feckless Greeks, Italians and Spaniards in their sunny vacationlands, German taxpayers understandably objected to paying the bill. But now that the problem has escalated into a crisis that could topple their own banks, the Germans and their cautious chancellor have changed sides and committed themselves to big, fast action, including an expanded European Financial Stability Facility fund to recapitalize the banks. Roger Altman, the former No. 2 in President Clinton’s Treasury Department, has dubbed the idea “EuroTARP,” after the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program. Like the American version, it’s likely to be expensive and unpopular — but also necessary and, with luck, effective.
Merkel’s decision to act has had political implications far beyond the financial technicalities. The German leader had to choose between two stark alternatives: to make the Eurozone of 17 countries that have adopted a single currency a closer, more integrated economic unit, or to begin working on an orderly breakup. She opted for integration. “The euro is the guarantee of a united Europe,” she told the German Parliament last month. “If the euro fails, then Europe fails.”
In the meantime, the European Union will have to make difficult choices about whose money goes into the stability fund and who will be allowed to draw money from it. (Imagine what it would have been like to launch TARP if every state legislature had been allowed to weigh in.)

Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have made a great show of working as a partnership, but it’s clear that Germany — the continent’s biggest healthy economy and the only one that can really guarantee new financing — is in charge. The Economist recently printed a cartoon that showed Merkel driving a muscular BMW motorcycle, with Sarkozy sitting glumly in the sidecar.
Originally, the euro was supposed to limit Germany’s economic power by making it merely one of 17 partners backing a single strong currency. Instead, the Eurozone’s weakness has forced Germany to lead, and forced France and others to accept that Berlin is in charge. Soon there will be tougher fiscal rules for governments in Paris, Rome, Madrid and Athens — and they will all need to pass muster in Berlin.
Americans have a stake in their success. A European recession could push the U.S. economy into a double dip. And U.S. banks aren’t immune from the European disease. It’s estimated that American banks hold more than $600 billion in government bonds issued by the PIIGS — Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.
A successful Europe is good for U.S. foreign policy as well. When European countries feel prosperous, they’re more able to contribute to joint actions abroad, such as the war in Afghanistan or the bombing in Libya. If Europe is divided and poor, our allies may not be as helpful as we’d like.
In an earlier era, Americans might have found some comfort in Europe’s troubles. We might have enjoyed watching supercilious foreigners find that their political and economic systems could be just as dysfunctional as ours. Back in 2008, Europeans enjoyed pointing fingers at Americans for dragging the world into a slump. We may have had subprime mortgages; they have entire subprime countries.
But globalization, which was supposed to make us all rich and happy, hasn’t merely fallen short of that goal. It’s made us all mutually vulnerable and mutually worried. It’s even robbed us of the pleasure of an old European emotion: schadenfreude.

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-putin-20140904-story.html;2014-09-04;As NATO talks near, Merkel appears to be losing patience with Putin - Los Angeles Times;"As Russia has expanded its military footprint in neighboring Ukraine, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has held repeated consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, so numerous that the German magazine Der Spiegel recently tried to count the phone calls between Berlin and Moscow since November. At least 25, it concluded. Or possibly 35.
As the only top Western leader who still talks frequently to Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has played a pivotal role in efforts to curb Russian aggression in Ukraine through sanctions while seeking to bridge a rift between NATO and Russia that threatens a new Cold War.
So far, the Russian leader hasn’t bent, and Merkel’s patience appears to be wearing thin. What more she and her Western colleagues can do is a frustrating question that Merkel and her allies must finally try to answer.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders meet in Wales on Thursday with the alliance facing perhaps its greatest challenge since the collapse of the Soviet Union. They are expected to show a united front, imposing yet more sanctions on Moscow and approving a force that could rapidly deploy to Europe’s borders with Russia.
Merkel and her fellow Western leaders are angered by Russia’s actions in Ukraine, especially its seizure of Crimea, support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine and fresh military incursion. Moscow’s denial that it has any involvement in Ukraine’s blood conflict only irks them more.
The German chancellor has signaled a tougher stance toward Russia, spelling out her willingness to sacrifice German economic interests and further boost sanctions to send a strong message that Moscow’s actions are unacceptable.
“Being able to change borders in Europe without consequences, and attacking other countries with troops, is in my view a far greater danger than having to accept certain disadvantages for the economy,” she said Monday after delivering an address to the German Parliament.
But with military support for Ukraine ruled out, and Germany firmly opposed to anything but a negotiated political solution, many worry that NATO’s actions will sting but not deter Russia from its military incursion in Ukraine. With both sides hardening their positions, their relations are in the deep freeze, and getting colder.

“She’s balancing all sides, with no real success, quite honestly,” said analyst Stefan Kornelius, author of Merkel’s authorized biography. “She has not managed to move Putin one inch.”
Merkel’s central role in maintaining a united European front faced with the Ukraine crisis — and her country’s influence with Putin — are partly a reflection of German economic power in Europe, analysts say. Germany has significant economic links with Russia: It imports nearly a third of its energy from and is the biggest European exporter to Russia.
Merkel has never had the cozy relationship that her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, cultivated with Putin. But she gets the Russian leader, his background and his geopolitical concerns in a way that eludes other Western leaders, according to analysts. Raised in East Germany, she speaks Russian; Putin, formerly stationed as a KGB officer in East Germany, is fluent in German.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Germany has been understanding of Russia’s prickly hypersensitivity over its loss of its superpower status. After NATO’s expansion to include Poland in 1999 and the Baltic states in 2004, Moscow viewed efforts to bring Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance as a provocative threat to its interests. Merkel opposed the move, seeking to not antagonize Russia.
Putin has fostered the economic links with Germany and played on tension between NATO partners, hoping to divide Europe. Russia offered asylum to Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the extent of American Internet and cellphone surveillance, including his allegation that the United States tapped Merkel’s cellphone, a revelation that deeply angered the German leader.
But lately, Merkel has grown impatient with Putin’s denials of Russian support for eastern Ukraine’s separatists, even as NATO offers evidence of a growing Russian troop presence in the east.
“I think what’s interesting about Merkel is that she has overcome some initial caution on how to handle the crisis and her view is that sanctions are needed as part of the effort to dissuade Russia from its current course,” said John Lough, associate fellow with London-based think tank Chatham House. “The German government placed a good deal of trust in Mr. Putin, and his government embarrassed Germany.”
Kornelius, the biographer, said Merkel now sees Putin as an unreliable figure, out of touch with reality.
“Her basic view on Putin is we keep on talking, but he’s not to be trusted,” Kornelius said in a telephone interview. “He can reverse everything he says within minutes, pretty much saying he’s a liar. She never expected too much, but he’s disappointed her so much. She’s given up hoping that he can be encamped somewhere within our system of democratic, law-based countries.
“Russia’s relations with the West have really unraveled fully. We can’t really think how to renew them. This fire has to blow out before you can assess the damage.”
There are significant business interests and political forces in Germany opposed to tough action against Moscow, including leading members of the Social Democratic Party. But as Merkel’s position on Russia has changed, their influence has waned.
Merkel hardened her stance when Putin grabbed the Crimean peninsula in March, and more so after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in July by separatists using a missile that Russia was accused of supplying.
“You have a huge faction of society which is sympathetic to Putin and Russia,” said Kornelius, citing a public opinion poll in March in which most Germans supported a more neutral stance in the conflict. But “what Putin did reversed public opinion here” with the pro-Russia camp “losing influence every day.”
On Monday, Merkel made it clear that she rejected Putin’s characterization of the Ukraine crisis as a civil war, calling it a conflict between Moscow and Kiev. But she strongly opposes military support or the supply of arms to Ukraine, insisting that the only solution is a negotiated political settlement.
The escalating sanctions aim to make it so expensive for Russia that Putin will quietly abandon the separatists. But they’ve had the opposite effect, according to some analysts, with Russia continuing its well-worn path of supporting the opposition in neighboring states to keep those countries weak and fearful.
Lough said Germany was “signaling to Russia that if you do this, a very bad situation is going to get worse, and it’s going to be worse for you than it is for us. So far the Russians haven’t heeded those warnings. We are getting into something of a downward spiral that it’s difficult to see a way out of.”
Despite Merkel’s search for a political solution, so far there has been no final deal that would stabilize Ukraine, end Russian interference and allay Western concerns.
Putin has suggested Kiev offer the separatists some form of autonomy or independence, a proposal that seems to reward Russia’s intervention and give it indefinite leverage in eastern Ukraine. Putin has made it clear that he’s unwilling to give up Crimea.
“NATO is not prepared to fight a war with Russia over Ukraine, and he’s prepared to fight a war,” said Kornelius. “Since no one is prepared to fight for Ukraine or deliver weapons to Ukraine, there’s not much for him to lose.”

Heavy shelling of suburban neighborhoods of Donetsk, a separatist stronghold, was witnessed by monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the group reported Sunday.
A statement on the website of the separatist-declared Donetsk People’s Republic said six civilians were killed Sunday and at least 15 wounded. The OSCE monitors reported seeing the body of one woman sprawled on the street.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russian President Vladimir Putin to urge him to respect the cease-fire and remove any Russian forces from the territory of his sovereign neighbor, according to German government spokesman Steffen Seibert.
A Kremlin press service account of the phone conversation made no mention of the cease-fire violations, reporting only that the two leaders discussed “the importance for the parties in the conflict to strictly comply with the cease-fire and effective monitoring of the peace process through the OSCE.” Russian media took scant notice of the artillery firing that Ukrainian officials said hit civilian areas of at least a dozen towns and villages.
OSCE also reported Monday that a convoy of its monitors asked by a Dutch-led international investigative team to inspect the scene of the July 17 Malaysia Airlines crash came under fire while traveling through the Shakhtarsk area, about 40 miles east of Donetsk city.
“The patrol vehicles were damaged by artillery or mortar fire” and the monitors were forced to return to Donetsk in the only usable vehicle, the OSCE report said. The monitors didn’t reach the separatist-held city until early Monday because of numerous diversions ordered by fighters on both sides and the necessity of avoiding roads believed to be mined, the report said.
In Kiev, OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said the monitors were shaken by their ordeal but unharmed.

“But for the fact that they were in two heavily armored vehicles the consequences of the shelling could have been much more serious,” Bociurkiw said. “It is not our job to say whether the cease-fire works or not but we certainly need to work in more secure conditions to observe and monitor the process.”
Ukrainian army positions in Donetsk and Luhansk regions sustained heavy artillery fire during the previous 24 hours, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Monday.
He also reported that fighting has flared around the Donetsk international airport, one of the few key areas of the region still under government control although it has been closed because of fighting since May.
The separatists, in turn, accused the government of opening fire on their positions around Donetsk, a city of a million residents before the pro-Russia militants began occupying government buildings in late March in hopes of annexing the two eastern regions to the Russian Federation, as occurred with Ukraine’s seized Crimean peninsula in mid-March.
On Monday alone, the Donetsk separatist leadership reported, Ukrainian troops shelled the separatists’ positions at least three times.
“We will stick to our [truce] agreements with Ukraine,” Alexander Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-proclaimed entity, told Interfax news agency. “But we will continue to stay ready for any military response action if necessary.”
The conflict in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 3,000 lives and sent hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes for safer refuge in Russia and Ukraine.

Went really well; 30,000 or so Greeks turned out to greet her.
OK, well, “greet” might not be the right word.
The Greeks can be fun-loving and laid back, but not when it comes to the leader whom, as The Times reported, “they blame for pushing Greece down the road to economic ruin through her relentless emphasis on austerity in exchange for emergency aid.”
So it was kind of like President Obama going to a tea party rally.
The woman some protesters called “the new Fuhrer” got a hot reception:
Just minutes before Merkel arrived in downtown Athens, protesters dressed as Nazi officers rolled into Syntagma Square, outside the Greek Parliament building, in a military jeep festooned with swastika-stamped flags.
Then, as the German leader gave only qualified support for Greece’s continued membership in the Eurozone, the club of 17 nations that use the euro currency, militant protesters fired a flurry of firecracker-like projectiles at the police outside Parliament.
Gosh, they didn’t advertise those events on the cruise ship itinerary!
Many conservative Americans, of course, both in California and the rest of the country, see Greece as a kind of canary in the coal mine for what’s in store for us -- until/unless Gov. Jerrry Brown, Obama and Democrats/liberals everywhere are driven from our midst.

And quotes like this feed that notion:
“History is repeating itself,” said Georgia Taragi, a 59-year-old pensioner. “Only this time we won’t stand for it. Greeks have awakened.”
The key phrase there being “a 59-year-old pensioner.”
Yikes! Unless Georgia was a firefighter/police officer, some might argue that that’s kinda young to be retired. (This is the part where the dear readers jump in with comments like “What about California!? Stinkin’ unions will be the death of us!” and the like. So there, I’ve saved you the trouble. Try something new.)
But the Greeks aren’t alone. In Paris on Tuesday, French lawmakers signaled their allegiance to the so-called golden rule of Eurozone budgeting, in which European countries commit to reducing their public deficits to within 0.5% of gross domestic product.
Of course, this being France, there’s “yes” and then there’s “oui”:
At present, France’s deficit is hovering around 4.6%, though the country’s Socialist president, Francois Hollande, has pledged to reduce it to 3% by the end of next year.
The government has admitted that it is unlikely France will reach the standard of the “golden rule” before 2015. The country has not balanced its books in decades and has regularly flouted existing European Union rules that member states keep their spending to within 3% of GDP. In 2011, France’s deficit hit 5.2%
Still, for those of you who think Obama’s a socialist, here’s what a real one had to say:
Bruno le Roux, the president of the ruling Socialists in the National Assembly, called on his fellow party members to support Hollande, and the majority heeded that call.
“This is serious at the beginning of a five-year term in office and when it’s the first solemn vote of the Assembly. It’s a question of political responsibility,” Le Roux said.
He told opponents: “Europe is about responsibilities -- it’s for us to make it. Stop dreaming. Make it!”
Talk about bipartisanship. Maybe Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner can learn a thing or two from the French after all.
Besides, when socialists start talking tough about the economy, maybe this is serious.
Which is echoed in another chilling tidbit from The Times on Tuesday:
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday downgraded its economic projections and warned of an “alarmingly high” risk of a serious global slowdown because of fiscal problems in the U.S. and Europe.
So, if you thought $5-a-gallon gas was bad, you better start cheering for Angela Merkel -- and the Greeks and the French -- to do the right thing.
Perhaps Obama and Mitt Romney can debate that next time. It might be dull, but it’s certainly important.

https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-merkel-germany-20120614-story.html;2012-06-14;Merkel rejects Germany as savior of Spain, Italy, rest of Europe - Los Angeles Times;"Chancellor Angela Merkel says her country is a lot of things, including “the economic engine and … the anchor of stability in Europe.” But what Germany is not, she said, is Superman, sweeping in with euro zone deposit guarantees and debt underwriting to single-handedly save its struggling neighbors.
“We … know Germany’s strength is not infinite,” Merkel said Thursday before parliament.
As the European debt crisis deepens, world leaders have increasingly looked to Merkel for help. Spain’s borrowing costs were spiking Thursday, with its 10-year bond yield reaching a high above 7% -- the same level at which Greece, Ireland and Portugal began asking for their bailouts.
Spain, which this weekend asked for a rescue package worth up to 100 billion euros, also had its credit rating downgraded by Moody’s to Baa3 – one notch above junk. Last week, Fitch also slashed its rating for the country.
But “miracle solutions,” such as the euro zone-wide banking union backed by officials from Spain, Italy and France, are “counterproductive,” Merkel said. Germany, as the continent’s largest and strongest economy, would end up shouldering much of the burden if debts were to be shared across several countries.
Instead, the chancellor called for deeper political integration across the continent.
“I know that it’s arduous, that it’s painful, that it’s drawn-out,” she said. “It’s a Herculean task but it is unavoidable.”
Whether it comes to pass is another matter. Merkel is headed for a faceoff next week during the G20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, a day after an election in Greece may determine whether the country stays with the euro currency or defects to the drachma.

Other topics at the confab “will all be overshadowed” by the malaise in Europe, Merkel said.
“It will dominate the discussions,” she said. “And therefore there is no doubt that we, that Germany, will be the center of attention.”
Is this how the “German empire” – predicted recently by financier George Soros – begins?

Her insistence that debt-ridden European nations cut their way out of financial crises helped cost her conservative political party two state elections this month, exposed her to criticism as an inflexible taskmaster across the Eurozone and unleashed a torrent of anti-austerity venting that has toppled like-thinking national and regional leaders in France, Greece, Italy and elsewhere.
Guardians of the global economy are now also ganging up on the German leader.
On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that the euro crisis threatens growth and recovery throughout the world, the United States included.
“The crisis in the euro area has become more serious recently, and it remains the most important source of risk to the global economy,” wrote OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan, noting elections this month that brought Socialist President Francois Hollande to power in France and toppled a Greek government committed to taking the hard steps needed to stay in the Eurozone, the 17-nation bloc that shares the euro currency.
The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, also called Tuesday for easing the debt burdens of the struggling Eurozone countries by issuing new bonds that would spread liability among all euro nations and bring down interest rates.
Merkel enters a lions den in Brussels on Wednesday night, when leaders of the European Union will gather to discuss the Eurozone’s fiscal and political turmoil.
“I will outline all growth proposals at this informal meeting,” Hollande told reporters Saturday after the Group of 8 meeting, where President Obama joined in pressing Merkel for growth measures in Europe. “Within this packet of proposals, there will be euro bonds, and I will not be alone in proposing them.”
Hollande was referring to support for such bonds voiced by Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, which is a member of the European Union but not the Eurozone.
Merkel appears unfazed by the chorus of calls to relent on the austerity focus.
Leveling out borrowing costs with joint-liability bonds would reduce the incentive for debt-ridden countries to put their finances in order, she believes. She has also opposed more aggressive intervention by the European Central Bank, which could cause the Eurozone to exceed its inflation targets.
For much of the last year, Merkel led the charge in imposing a tough regimen of fiscal discipline on the struggling nations of the Eurozone. Yet as the continent’s economic crisis has dragged on, Merkel has seen her allies, most notably French President Nicolas Sarkozy, fall away one by one, either suffering electoral defeat or coming around to the need to balance austerity with growth.
“Merkel against the rest of the world,” proclaimed a headline Monday in the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, accusing her of exacerbating the crisis to appease domestic concerns.
A poll this month showed Merkel still has the approval of 61% of Germans, who remain wary of bold European intervention in the crisis that would see their tax dollars going to wayward neighbors.
But her stance has won few friends in countries where harsh deficit reduction has cut growth and boosted unemployment. In Greece, the hardest-hit country, a poll in February showed just 4% approval of Merkel, with more than three-quarters of Greeks agreeing that Germany was trying to establish a “Fourth Reich.”
The German government has made some minor course changes in recent weeks. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble spoke in support of higher wages that would give Germans more money to spend on goods from neighboring countries. And the German national bank, the Bundesbank, said it would accept higher inflation to foster growth in the Eurozone.
“You already see that Merkel’s making verbal compromises, rhetorical compromises,” said Sebastian Dullien, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. But “I still don’t see any imminent compromise on the really important issues, which are euro bonds or the debt redemption pact.”
A German government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, downplayed Germany’s supposed isolation, saying the French proposals drawing the most resistance from Merkel are long shots.
“Hollande knows that he’s not going to be able to change the mandate of the ECB and he’s not going to push through euro bonds, at least not in this decade,” the official said. “Once you identify the bargaining chips and what he’s really after, you end up with something really close to what we are looking for.”
Areas of agreement in Brussels may include funding for infrastructure projects and increased lending for the European Investment Bank to support European businesses, both of which could boost growth.
If the crisis deepens and more decisive measures are needed, Merkel will come around to compromise on the bigger issues, Dullien believes.
“If you see a new turn of the crisis to the worse, I believe Merkel would move,” he said. “That’s how Merkel usually acts. She can be a little slow, but when things get bad, she moves.”

Merkel’s party mustered about 26% of the vote in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a drop from 35% in 2010 and 45% in 2005, the year she took office, the results show. The opposition Social Democrats and Greens, at about 39% and more than 11%, respectively, secured the majority of seats they needed to form a governing coalition.
The upstart Pirate Party, a group primarily devoted to Internet freedom, rode its recent surge in popularity to a nearly 8% vote share and won entry into its fourth consecutive state parliament. Merkel’s national coalition partner, the Free Democrats, managed a better-than-expected 8%, above the 5% threshold needed for representation, while the far-left Left Party was kicked out of the statehouse with less than 3% of the vote. Other parties with low shares accounted for the remaining votes.
Election results in North Rhine-Westphalia have been harbingers of change in the past. It was a loss in this state in 2005 that brought down the chancellorship of Merkel’s predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder. Now, the state that allowed Merkel to assume power in the first place could undermine her quest for a third term.
The disappointing result for the conservative parties in North Rhine-Westphalia follows a similarly poor showing a week ago in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, where the governing Christian Democrat-Free Democrat coalition was ousted.
But the North Rhine-Westphalia election is particularly significant, both because of the state’s importance in Germany — over a fifth of the country’s population resides here — and because the campaign was largely framed as a referendum on Merkel’s austerity policies.
The Christian Democrats’ candidate for governor, Norbert Roettgen, who serves as Merkel’s environment minister and is often mentioned as a potential successor to the chancellor, announced late Sunday that he would resign as the local party chief.
On the campaign trail, Roettgen hammered at the need for budgetary restraint and criticized what he labeled the free-spending ways of the current governor, Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft, whose deficit-raising budget proposal brought down her minority government and forced Sunday’s election.
Merkel’s opponents, however, tried to ride the wave of anti-austerity sentiment sweeping across Europe. In recent weeks, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, both close allies of Merkel, have been pushed from power, and parties supporting austerity policies lost ground in Greek elections.
“Whoever’s campaign Merkel supports loses: Jost de Jager, Sarkozy, and now Roettgen is facing the same fate,” Green Party parliamentary Chairman Juergen Trittin said recently. De Jager was the losing candidate in the Schleswig-Holstein election.
Merkel has so far stuck to her message of the need for austerity cuts to relieve Europe’s debt crisis. But she has become increasingly isolated.
Polling had shown the Social Democrats to be the overwhelming favorite to capture the most votes in Sunday’s race in North Rhine-Westphalia. But the Christian Democrats were hoping to deny the Social Democrats and Greens a majority and thereby force a so-called grand coalition between Christian and Social Democrats.
A grand coalition on the national level is a realistic possibility after next year’s federal elections. The Christian Democrats remain the most popular party nationwide, but the Free Democrats have suffered such a collapse that a continuation of the current governing coalition is unlikely. And by attracting a sizable portion of the youth vote, the Pirate Party could prevent the Social Democrats and Greens from forming a national majority.

Instead, Hollande’s welcome to Berlin just hours after he took office was brisk but warm, even if he was late for dinner. Hollande — whose initial flight to Berlin was hit by lightning, causing him to briefly return to an air base outside Paris to switch planes — and Merkel met for an hour before dining together.
Last week, Hollande, 57, defeated incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy on a promise to renegotiate Merkel’s prized pact enshrining public spending limits throughout the European Union. He believes in spending and investment to encourage growth.
Observers described the atmosphere at the Berlin meeting as cordial but awkward.
At an after-dinner news conference, Merkel joked that the lightning strike, which did not cause any injuries, was a good omen for their future relationship.
“We have quite an intensive agenda in terms of European questions,” she said.
The two leaders said they had talked about Greece and reiterated their hope that the financially stricken country will remain in the Eurozone, the 17-nation group that uses the euro.
Hollande spoke of “balance in the Franco-German relationship” and brought up the thorny subject of renegotiating the fiscal pact to encourage growth.

Earlier, Hollande, nicknamed Monsieur Normal, was inaugurated as the 24th president of France at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
The first Socialist leader of the country in 17 years arrived for his swearing-in just in time after crossing Paris by car, stopping at traffic lights en route and even waiting in a traffic jam.
“On this day I am invested with the highest office of state, I send the French a message of confidence. We are a great country which throughout its history has risen to difficulties and challenges,” Hollande said.
“My job is to put France back on its feet with justice, to open a new way in Europe, contribute to the peace of the world and the preservation of the planet,” Hollande said, despite “massive debt, weak growth, high unemployment … a Europe that is having difficulty emerging from the crisis.”
The mantra of the Hollande government, he said, would be “dignity, simplicity and sobriety.”

https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-landshut-20160126-story.html;2016-01-26;Why a small-town official in Germany and a busload of Syrian refugees hit the road to see Angela Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"As the bus rumbled toward Berlin, dozens of television crews began following it.
On board were 31 Syrian refugees who had been living in the Bavarian county of Landshut. Driving separately in a car was Peter Dreier, a local politician there who had arranged the 342-mile journey.
His plan: to drop them at the doorstep of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Join the conversation on Facebook >>
By time the bus arrived at Merkel’s office, Dreier was well on his way to national fame as a symbol of the opposition against the policies that have forced small communities across Germany to take in many of the thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere arriving in the country each day.
“I wanted to send a signal that we can’t simply carry on with the same policies on refugees anymore,” Dreier, 49, said in an interview back in Landshut a week after the mid-January trip.
“Our national leaders have to do a better job coordinating all this and can’t just dump the problems on the counties and cities like they’ve been doing,” he said.
Germany took in 1.1 million refugees last year, more than any other country. More than 3,000 people a day have been arriving this month from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries in turmoil.

Merkel has refused to close the borders or — as every other country in the European Union has done — set limits on how many refugees will be admitted. She argues that turning people away is inhumane and would leave tens of thousands of people stranded on a treacherous route.
Last Friday, more than 40 people, including many children, died when two wooden smuggling boats capsized in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.
Merkel has also said she fears that restricting the borders would snarl traffic and imperil trade.
Her stance has left her increasingly isolated in Europe and at home. One opinion poll last week found that 79% of Germans opposed her open-door policy and that 90% of voters in her own party, the Christian Democratic Union, wanted her to change course.
The vast majority of refugees have settled in big cities, and that is where the issue has been most explosive. Some refugee centers house hundreds of people.
In an incident that turned many Germans against Merkel’s policy, hundreds of women in Cologne reported being groped and robbed on New Year’s Eve by mobs of men. Among the 30 suspects detained, half were asylum-seekers from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria.
Landshut, in contrast, has been a peaceful place for refugees. The idyllic southern county of 152,000 people is one of Germany’s wealthiest, with two large BMW factories and unemployment hovering just above 1%.
It has taken in about 2,200 refugees so far, according to Dreier. Roughly 70 more have been arriving each week.
Groups of 10 to a maximum of 40 live in private houses or remodeled restaurants rented by the county.
“We’ve found it helps promote integration when the refugees are sheltered in smaller private houses,” said Jakob Fuchs, head of public security and foreigner issues in the county. “We’ve rented 69 separate facilities in 30 of the 35 towns in the county and for the most part it’s worked well. They’re taking German lessons and integration courses.”
The impact has been relatively minor, and officials want to keep it that way. Dreier said that if the refugee influx continues, it will eventually become impossible to house them all.
That was one message he intended to convey with the bus trip, he said.
When the bus arrived, it parked in front of Merkel’s office for 90 minutes amid uncertainty about the next move. Some of the refugees told reporters that they felt they were being exploited for political purposes and that they felt duped.
“They told us the situation in Berlin would be better and we could go there if we wanted to,” one man from Damascus told a television crew.
Dreier said he was disappointed that Merkel didn’t come out to greet the refugees.
When authorities in Berlin finally offered the refugees a place to stay, Dreier got an firsthand lesson in the difference between cities and the countryside when it comes to accommodating the newcomers.
“They were going to send us to an emergency shelter set up in abandoned factory building with some heating on and mattresses set up on the floor,” he said. “The place they offered wasn’t fit for human beings so I turned that down and we went to a hotel instead.”
He said he paid the $1,500 hotel bill with his own money and dined in the hotel restaurant with the refugees.
The next day, the refugees were told that they were welcome to stay in Berlin. All but two chose to take the bus back to Landshut.
Refugees interviewed there described the locals as generous and hospitable.
“It’s actually a nice place,” said Tamar Assafin, a 26-year-old who fled Syria and walked for weeks to Germany from Greece last summer. “I’d like to learn German so I can move on in society and start to look for a job. I worked as an accountant in a hotel in Syria, and on computers and as a translator.”
Assafin said he considered taking up Dreier’s offer to take the bus to Berlin but decided against it. “We asked where we would end up in Berlin, in a house or private apartment? But he said he didn’t know either. It’s a good situation here, and the chances for a job here are better.”
He said he could understand German angst over the influx. “You can’t blame the Germans for getting angry,” he said. “They’re afraid because there’s such a massive number of people coming into their country.”
Those fears have helped transform Dreier from a little-known county commissioner into a popular national figure.
He said he has received more than 1,000 supportive emails, letters and faxes. A poll last week by Radio Trausnitz, in Landshut, found that 94% of respondents agreed that the bus trip was “a courageous step,” and 6% thought “it was just a public relations gag.”
Gerti Simmet, one of more than 500 people in Landshut who have volunteered to tutor refugees in the German language and culture, said Dreier’s bus trip to Berlin had put a much needed spotlight on the problem.
“I think it woke a lot of people up about the things the refugees urgently need, like places to live,” said Simmet, 54, who is helping 11 Syrians.
But Johanna Triebs, a 17-year-old student in Landshut, said Dreier’s trip to Berlin was misguided: “These are refugees from a war zone, and you can’t just dump them off on someone else.”
“There aren’t even that many refugees here, and you hardly see them in town,” she said. “I think it’s great that Germany is helping so much. Why not? We’re a rich country and we can afford to help them.”

“Two ways…Gradually, then suddenly.” The last week suggests that getting out of bankruptcy works the same way.
It’s difficult to exaggerate the suddenness and significance of the change in attitudes — and policies — wrought by Russia’s unprovoked and indefensible invasion of Ukraine. Imposing banking sanctions via the SWIFT system was considered too heavy a lift on the eve of the invasion. Now it has started in the U.S., Canada, Japan, the European Union and even “neutral” Switzerland. The U.K., long addicted to Russian oligarch money, has announced an asset freeze. BP and Shell Oil have announced they will divest from Russia as will Norway’s sovereign wealth fund.
Russian planes — including the private jets of oligarchs desperate to rescue their money — cannot fly over the EU. Russian vodka is being pulled from shelves worldwide, and FIFA has kicked Russia out of the World Cup.
Opinion
It may be that Russia will still manage to win some sort of military victory in Ukraine. But even if it does, the future does not look good for Putin.

But these moves pale in significance compared with the EU’s decision to provide lethal military aid to Ukraine, reversing a longstanding policy against selling arms to countries in “conflict zones.” The EU is even scrounging up fighter jets for delivery to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Germany’s about-face is simply staggering. For years, Germany pursued a repugnant codependent relationship with the Putin regime; now they sound like they want a divorce. And not just from Russia, but from the hyper-pacifist politics that defined German foreign policy for a generation. Its last move under the old paradigm was to offer Ukraine 5,000 helmets and a field hospital. The scorn this meager gesture invited from allies, but more importantly from the German public, in the wake of Russia’s onslaught, led German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tear up his predecessor Angela Merkel’s policies. Not only is Germany sending 1,000 shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets and 500 surface-to-air Stinger missiles, Scholz announced a commitment to a permanent increase in defense spending to finally meet NATO’s 2% of GDP requirement.
Obviously, the events unfolding in Ukraine are the primary driver of all this. Except for diehard Putin apologists, few can bear witness to Ukrainian heroism and Russian villainy and perfidy and not be moved. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s stirring appeals to the EU, public and private, have been crucial.

“Example is the school of mankind,” Edmund Burke said, “and they will learn at no other.” In other words, the bloody reality on the ground demonstrated a fact that theoretical or historical arguments could not; the relative peace of the post-World War II order was not sustained — or sustainable — by talk and paper agreements alone.
But as with bankruptcy, this sea change was a long time coming and America has a lot to do with it.
Opinion
The U.S. and other Western nations send Russia an average of $500 million for energy every day, effectively financing Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.

Domestic partisan talking points are fairly useless in understanding our role in hastening this revolution in attitudes and policy. Donald Trump’s exaggerated claims that his administration was tougher on Russia than either his successor or predecessor have some merit. He maintained some of Barack Obama’s sanctions and imposed additional ones. Trump even signed, reluctantly, a sanctions bill on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which President Biden lifted.
But this leaves out two important points. First, many of the policies imposed by Trump’s administration were pushed by officials working around his preferences. Second, and more important, Trump incessantly signaled that America’s bipartisan commitments to longstanding security arrangements could no longer be assumed to be permanent.
And not just rhetorically. In Syria, for example, Russian forces attacked American troops and we did nothing, save ultimately retreat from Syria. Trump was impeached for using — clearly needed — security aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to extract partisan ammo against  Biden. Allied governments saw  Trump’s open hostility to NATO, his indifference to South Korea and his rhetorical sycophancy for Putin and other despots and their strategic calculations changed.
Similarly, while Biden deserves qualified praise for his handling of the Ukraine crisis, it’s meager compensation for the blow to American credibility struck by his incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Putin might well  have invaded Ukraine absent the Afghanistan debacle, but it’s hard to see how he didn’t take it as a sign  that America and NATO had lost the will to fight. And Obama’s refusal to enforce his own “red line” in Syria, after Russia’s client Bashar Assad crossed it, not to mention his relative acquiescence to Putin’s seizure of Crimea, sent the wrong signals to friends and foes alike.
The international order abhors a vacuum, and America’s shrinking role in the world — real and perceived — over at least three administrations made it reasonable for Putin to gamble that the sun was setting on that old order. But, as Hemingway said, the sun also rises.

Merkel, 59, returns to power at a time when the region has yet to get back on its feet fully from its still-unresolved debt crisis, and as Germany’s relations with the United States continue to suffer from the fallout over revelations that American spies tapped her phone and collected electronic data on ordinary Germans.

Her confirmation as chancellor in a vote by lawmakers in the Bundestag on Tuesday was virtually assured after her Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, came in first place by a wide margin when Germans went to the polls in September. But the party fell just short of a majority of seats in the Bundestag, touching off weeks of negotiation with other groups to form a government.

Merkel will preside over a “grand coalition” uniting the conservative CDU with its archrival, the center-left Social Democrats, who finished second in the election. The two parties agreed on an agenda that should see a continuation of Merkel’s tax-friendly policies tempered by some concessions to the Social Democrats, including Germany’s first national minimum wage and some pension increases.

As one of Europe’s most powerful leaders, Merkel is unlikely to deviate from Berlin’s approach so far to the low-boil euro debt crisis: a fierce insistence on austerity in financially troubled countries, many of whose residents blame Germany for inflicting economic misery on them. The current finance minister, the feisty Wolfgang Schaeuble, will remain in his post.

The new government will also include Germany’s first female defense secretary, Ursula von der Leyen. The promotion for the former labor minister is widely regarded as a sign that Merkel has picked her out as a potential successor.

But it’s not as if Merkel has spoken of — or even hinted at — retirement. If she serves out this new term, until 2017, she will have occupied the chancellor’s office for 12 years and worked with three American presidents. That would eclipse the record of the other formidable female European leader to whom Merkel is sometimes compared, the late Margaret Thatcher, who also won three elections in Britain and served as its prime minister for 11 years.

Thatcher was toppled by members of her own Conservative Party, who had grown concerned over her deepening unpopularity in the country at large. Merkel, by contrast, regularly polls as Germany’s most popular national politician.


“I wouldn’t confuse coalition politics and the amount of time it took to negotiate this government with the level of her popularity and support in the country,” said Philip Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Berlin from 2009 until earlier this year. “At least at this moment on the stage there’s no one to rival her.”

She was elected chancellor Tuesday by a 462-150 vote in the Bundestag. Conspicuously absent from the chamber were lawmakers from the junior party in her last government, the business-friendly Free Democrats, who, in a major upset, failed in September to win the minimum number of votes required to re-enter parliament.

“I accept the election result and thank you for your trust,” a smiling Merkel said.

This is her second grand coalition government; the first, from 2005 to 2009, proved to be a disaster for the Social Democrats, who were punished at the polls for becoming too closely identified with Merkel’s CDU. During coalition negotiations this time, leaders of the Social Democrats were determined to stamp the joint agenda with as much of their welfare-oriented emphasis as possible.

Following tradition, Merkel will make the first foreign trip of her new term almost immediately, on Wednesday, to Paris, to symbolize French and German amity after two world wars on opposing sides.

Whether relations with Washington can be quickly repaired, however, is another matter. The East German-raised Merkel, long an admirer of the U.S. and its freedoms, was outraged by leaked documents showing that American intelligence agents had tapped her phone.

The anger has spilled into talks between the U.S. and the European Union on a free-trade pact. Cooperation between American and German intelligence has also reportedly suffered.

“It’s a serious bump on the road — let there be no doubt about it,” Murphy said. But “we will get through this. There’s too much at stake. There’s too much history. The Germany-U.S. relationship will survive.”

But she hasn’t budged — yet.
Under intense domestic pressure, Merkel has continued to use the power of Europe’s strongest economy to insist that her beleaguered partners accept a new financial order and, indirectly, a new political reality.
That now includes France, which, though regarded as a partner with Germany in managing the crisis, is moving more along the lines of its southern neighbors for political and economic reasons.
France, with a sluggish economy, also is feeling a squeeze in borrowing costs from bond investors who are beginning to differentiate it more clearly from Germany’s stronger economy.
More important, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, facing an election next year, has split with Merkel on a crucial factor in the debt crisis — the role of the European Central Bank.
Joining troubled Spain and Britain, among others, France has called for the ECB to act as a lender of last resort and pump massive infusions of capital into the tottering financial system, much as the Federal Reserve did during the U.S. financial crisis in 2008.
Many economists see the central bank’s intervention as the only way to put out the flames of the 2-year-old debt crisis. But Merkel has steadfastly resisted such transfusions, hewing close to sentiments at home that such action will bear a heavy cost on Germany and possibly stir hyperinflation.
“There is a problem about the Franco-German” alliance, said Jean-Pierre Lehmann, professor of international political economy and founding director of the business advocate Evian Group in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The divergence between France and Germany on economic issues is powerful, he said, and they have different leadership styles and cultures.
Germany’s economy is running a trade surplus with China, a feat that has long eluded the U.S. and other countries. Germany also is dominated by small and medium-size private companies, and it invests heavily in research and development.
France’s economy, on the other hand, doesn’t have Germany’s strengths, Leh?mann said, and France will be pressured to push through the kinds of reforms that it and Germany have pressed their southern neighbors to enact.
Nervous investors have demanded higher interest rates on French government bonds since early October. Moody’s Investors Service warned France on Monday that a continuing rise in its borrowing costs could put the country’s AAA rating at greater risk of a downgrade.
“Ultimately I think the French will give in and will go through a period of turbulence,” Lehmann said.
That leaves Merkel largely by herself as she undertakes one of the biggest gambles in recent European history.
In pushing for more European integration in the way that countries manage their spending and run their economies, Merkel believes that Europe could emerge economically stronger and politically more united.
But if she fails, or miscalculates how much pressure the financial system — or the political systems in countries facing years of painful austerity — can withstand, the result could be a crisis that spreads throughout the global economy.
The sudden and significant step-up in Germany’s power concerns Constanze Stelzenmuller, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.
It’s already stirred an anti-German backlash, and not just on the streets of Greece. Across the continent, people are saying “Europe speaks German now,” Stelzenmuller said.
Yet the rise in power is “not just about calling the shots,” she said, “but the willingness and ability to persuade.”
Stelzenmuller said she sees Germany eventually acceding to calls for the European Central Bank to issue Eurobonds or take other monetary policy actions to relieve financial pressures that are continuing to mount on European governments.
On Friday, the new head of the ECB seemed to reject appeals that the institution intervene and said instead that national governments should step up their efforts to address economic deficiencies.
Germany stands as the only major economy in Europe that is expanding at a healthy clip. Its economy this year is expected to grow twice as fast as the 17-nation Eurozone average, and unemployment, at 7%, is lower than it was at the start of the global downturn three years ago.
Many analysts said these are byproducts of the nation’s manufacturing prowess and reforms it undertook nearly a decade ago, when it raised the pension retirement age from 60 to 65 — it has since gone up to 67 — and overhauled unemployment benefits and labor rules to give employers more flexibility to hire and fire workers.
But Germany has been a big beneficiary of the region’s economic integration and unified currency. Its economy is supported by substantial exports to its European neighbors, and a recession for the region would throw a wrench into Germany’s economic machine.
For that reason, Merkel has said what’s needed in addressing the debt crisis is “not less Europe, but more.” And she has spoken of the need to revise the Eurozone members’ treaty, presumably to create greater central power to monitor and enforce more fiscal discipline and transparency among countries.
At the same time, Merkel, like other national leaders, has continued to straddle the line to appease her fragile coalition in government, counterbalancing her belief that more European integration would be good for Germany with strong language that European debt shouldn’t be socialized.
She has repeatedly said that the central bank is no panacea to Europe’s problems.
Most German voters are unwilling to see their hard-earned wealth go to bail out what they see as less disciplined and less industrious countries.
“Why should we pay for Greece and Italy?” asked a 55-year-old school administration employee near Munich who would give only his first name, Maximilian.
He said he had no credit cards, only a bank debit card. Germany could afford to help its neighbors now, he said, but he expressed concern that he and other Germans would later pay the price through higher inflation.
At the moment, he said, he enjoyed a 3.5% interest rate on his 30-year home mortgage and 1.9% rate on his car.
“It’s the mentality,” he said of Germans’ fears of hyperinflation.
Many Germans had perceived Merkel as slow and indecisive. But more recently her stature has grown domestically as she has communicated more forcefully the gravity of the Eurozone situation and the reason she has been driving as hard a bargain as possible with other nations.
The tough tack has brought new governments in Greece and Italy run by economists, and has yielded promises of more sustainable public policies — signs that Merkel’s wait-it-out strategy may be working and may continue, at least, for a while.
“The more time passes, the more impressed I am at how she’s done this,” said Christoph Boehmer, a managing director of medical device maker Biotronik in Berlin, who generally hasn’t been a supporter of Merkel’s. “She’s either had a grand vision all along or is putting it together.”
Yet sound as such a program may seem in purely economic terms, it carries a heavy price for Germany’s much weaker neighbors, at least in the near term: little or no growth, higher unemployment, reduced government service and welfare systems.
And that raises the risk that a backlash could worsen a crisis that has carried the European economy — and Germany with it — into a potential economic no-man’s land.
Merkel has played her hand smartly so far, many analysts said. But with nobody knowing where the breaking point for the crisis may be, they said, Merkel may be waiting out time that neither she nor the rest of Europe has.

The White House denied that the U.S. was listening in on Merkel’s phone calls now.
“The president assured the chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said. “The United States greatly values our close cooperation with Germany on a broad range of shared security challenges.”
However, Carney did not specifically say that the U.S. had never monitored or obtained Merkel’s communications.
The German government said it responded after receiving “information that the chancellor’s cellphone may be monitored” by U.S. intelligence. It wouldn’t elaborate, but German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published material from National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, said its research triggered the response.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement that the chancellor made it clear to Obama in a phone call that “she views such practices, if the indications are confirmed … as completely unacceptable.”
Merkel said that among close partners such as Germany and the U.S., “there must not be such surveillance of a head of government’s communication,” Seibert added. “That would be a serious breach of trust. Such practices must be stopped immediately.”
Carney said the U.S. was examining Germany’s concerns as part of a review of how the U.S. gathers intelligence.

The White House has cited that review in responding to similar spying concerns from France, Brazil and other countries.
U.S. allies knew that the Americans were spying on them, but they had no idea how much.
As details of NSA spying programs have become public, citizens, activists and politicians in countries from Latin America to Europe have lined up to express shock and outrage at the scope of Washington’s spying.
Merkel has previously raised concerns about electronic eavesdropping, when Obama visited Germany in June; has demanded answers from the U.S. government; and backed calls for greater European data protection. Wednesday’s statement, however, was much more sharply worded and appeared to reflect frustration over the answers provided so far by the U.S. government.
Merkel called for U.S. authorities to clarify the extent of surveillance in Germany and to provide answers to “questions that the German government asked months ago,” Seibert said.
Overseas politicians are also using the threat to their citizens’ privacy to drum up their numbers at the polls — or to distract attention from their own domestic problems. Some have downplayed the matter to keep good relations with Washington.
After a Paris newspaper reported that the NSA had collected 70.3 million French telephone records in a 30-day period, the French government called the U.S. ambassador in for an explanation and put the issue of personal data protection on the agenda of the European Union summit that opens Thursday.
“Why are these practices, as they’re reported ... unacceptable? First because they are taking place between partners, between allies, and then because they clearly are an affront to private life,” Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the French government spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
But the official French position — that friendly nations should not spy on each another — can’t be taken literally, a former French foreign minister said.
“The magnitude of the eavesdropping is what shocked us,” Bernard Kouchner said in a radio interview. “Let’s be honest, we eavesdrop too. Everyone is listening to everyone else. But we don’t have the same means as the United States, which makes us jealous.”
In Germany, opposition politicians, the media and privacy activists have been vocal in their outrage over the U.S. eavesdropping. Until now, Merkel had worked hard to contain the damage to U.S.-German relations and refrained from saying anything bad about the Americans.
Merkel has said previously that her country was “dependent” on cooperation with the American spy agencies — crediting an American tip as the reason that security services foiled a terrorist plot in 2007 that targeted U.S. soldiers and citizens in Germany.
In Italy, major newspapers reported that a parliamentary committee was told that the U.S. had intercepted phone calls, emails and text messages of Italians. Prime Minister Enrico Letta raised the topic of spying during a visit Wednesday with Secretary of State John F. Kerry. A senior State Department official said Kerry made it clear that the Obama administration’s goal was to strike the right balance between security needs and privacy expectations.

Amid signs of anger from close allies over mass electronic surveillance, Germany’s Foreign Ministry also summoned U.S. Ambassador John B. Emerson to make clear its displeasure. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said afterward that he had demanded ”these activities that have been reported will be comprehensively investigated. We need the truth now.”

Arriving at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels, Merkel said that she had “repeatedly made clear to the American president [that] spying among friends is absolutely not OK. I said that to him in June when he was in Berlin, also in July, and yesterday in a telephone call.”

“We need trust among allies and partners,” she added. “Such trust must now be built anew.”

Merkel’s phone call with Obama was his second such conversation this week -- the first was with the president of France -- in which the American leader has had to soothe a European counterpart over revelations of spying on foreign nations on a gigantic scale by the National Security Agency.

German officials have poured scorn on the White House’s assurance that the U.S. is not currently monitoring Merkel’s cellphone and has no intention of doing so in the future, a statement that, the officials noted, did not answer whether such eavesdropping had occurred in the past. Merkel is known as an avid user of her cellphone for calls and text messages.

Her government has not elaborated on how it came to believe that the U.S. might have tapped her phone, but the German news magazine Der Spiegel says that it had sparked the chancellor’s concern with inquiries it made to her administration about suspected eavesdropping. The magazine has published a number of stories on U.S. spying based on the documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Obama’s earlier call to French President Francois Hollande came after a newspaper reported Monday that, according to documents leaked by Snowden, U.S. intelligence agencies had scooped up more than 70 million pieces of data on French phone communications within a 30-day period beginning at the end of last year.


A French government minister called such spying “totally unacceptable,” and Hollande’s government also summoned the U.S. ambassador to France for an explanation.

Whether the contretemps will cause any real or lasting damage to ties between the U.S. and two of its closest European allies remains to be seen. Some analysts say the outraged reactions by leaders on the continent are more about posturing and catering to public opinion at home than a real rupture of relations in a world where countries, even allied ones, routinely spy on one another.

German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere made a point of saying in a television interview that “the Americans are and remain our best friends,” though he added the now-expected caution that spying by such a close ally was “absolutely not right.”

Daniela Schwarzer, an analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said that the atmosphere at the moment is brittle.

“Trust was deeply shattered when the whole information was disclosed earlier this summer,” she said, referring to Snowden’s revelations. “Yes, we all know everyone is spying, but the degree of that is so encompassing that there has been a big issue with trust.”

“The consensus in Germany is still that a good transatlantic relationship is what we want,” she added, but “the trust issue is still there.”

Schwarzer noted that negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, were dragged down this year as a result of the Snowden’s disclosures.

“In France, the public debate went as far as being, ‘Look, we cannot possibly negotiate TTIP with America now, because they know everything about our strategy.’ So this goes very far in the political debate,” Schwarzer said. “Trust definitely needs to be rebuilt, and I think the Europeans will ask for something in the field of data protection where the U.S. needs to give something.”

U.S. officials declined Thursday to predict what Germany might do in response, but they noted that the two countries had agreed to work on intelligence privacy issues.

A spokesman for the German Embassy in Washington, Karl Bergner, said Germany was waiting for a U.S. explanation of what had taken place, and there has been no other official discussion of possible action by German officials.

“The ball is in the American court,” he said.

Obama’s earlier call to French President Francois Hollande came after a newspaper reported Monday that, according to documents leaked by Snowden, U.S. intelligence agencies had scooped up more than 70 million pieces of data on French phone communications within a 30-day period beginning at the end of last year.

A French government minister called such spying “totally unacceptable,” and Hollande’s government also summoned the U.S. ambassador to France for an explanation.
Whether the contretemps will cause any real or lasting damage to ties between the U.S. and two of its closest European allies remains to be seen. Some analysts say the outraged reactions by leaders on the continent are more about posturing and catering to public opinion at home than a real rupture of relations in a world where countries, even allied ones, routinely spy on one another.
German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere made a point of saying in a television interview that “the Americans are and remain our best friends,” though he added the now-expected caution that spying by such a close ally was “absolutely not right.”
Daniela Schwarzer, an analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said that the atmosphere at the moment is brittle.
“Trust was deeply shattered when the whole information was disclosed earlier this summer,” she said, referring to Snowden’s revelations. “Yes, we all know everyone is spying, but the degree of that is so encompassing that there has been a big issue with trust.”
“The consensus in Germany is still that a good transatlantic relationship is what we want,” she added, but “the trust issue is still there.”
Schwarzer noted that negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, were dragged down this year as a result of the Snowden’s disclosures.
“In France, the public debate went as far as being, ‘Look, we cannot possibly negotiate TTIP with America now, because they know everything about our strategy.’ So this goes very far in the political debate,” Schwarzer said. “Trust definitely needs to be rebuilt, and I think the Europeans will ask for something in the field of data protection where the U.S. needs to give something.”
U.S. officials declined Thursday to predict what Germany might do in response, but they noted that the two countries had agreed to work on intelligence privacy issues.
A spokesman for the German Embassy in Washington, Karl Bergner, said Germany was waiting for a U.S. explanation of what had taken place, and there has been no other official discussion of possible action by German officials.
“The ball is in the American court,” he said.

The exit poll results, released by state broadcaster ARD after voting ended at 6 p.m., showed Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats, or CDU, at 42%, leading the main opposition Social Democrats by 16 percentage points.

A new party founded in opposition to the euro, the Alternative for Germany, was polling at 4.9%, a whisker below the 5% threshold needed to enter the German parliament.

The results mean that Merkel, 59, is likely to serve a third four-year term as Germany’s chancellor.

The exit poll showed her current coalition partners, the Free Democrats, or FDP, at just 4.7%, too low to enter parliament. If that result holds, it would mean that the FDP, a liberal pro-business party, would drop out of the Bundestag for the first time in its history.

The FDP has been the kingmaker of German politics since the first post-war elections in 1949. But it has struggled as Merkel’s junior coalition partner. While the chancellor has claimed credit for Germany’s economic success, little of the FDP’s political program has been enacted.

Christian Lindner, a former general secretary of the party, told ARD that Sunday’s election marked “the most bitter hour since 1949"" for his party.

The exit poll results, if borne out by the tally of actual ballots, would mean the CDU’s share of the vote was up eight percentage points from the 2009 elections. Ursula von der Leyen, the Christian Democratic employment minister, told ARD the outcome was “simply fantastic” for her party.


Projections based on the exit poll showed the Christian Democrats, or CDU, winning 299 seats in the 598-seat Bundestag, just short of an outright majority. The Social Democrats, or SPD, would have 183 seats, and their allies, the Greens, would have 58. Die Linke, a far-left party descended from East Germany’s Communists, would also have 58 seats.

The CDU is likely to seek a “grand coalition” with the Social Democrats — a black-red union in Germany’s color-coded political language — in order to form a stable government.

The SPD is expected to demand the introduction of a national minimum wage and an increase in the top rate of taxation as the price of its support for a coalition. Both policies are opposed by the CDU as harmful for job creation.

The SPD may also push for a softer line on the Eurozone crisis, including some means of jointly guaranteeing state debts across the single currency area.

Surveys show that Merkel’s cautious handling of the Eurozone crisis is strongly endorsed by the German public. After eight years in power, her approval ratings still regularly top 60%.

The chancellor has presided over a strong economy with low unemployment. She boasts of keeping Germany stable despite turmoil across the continent.

Her Social Democrat challenger, Peer Steinbrück, has accused her of prescribing a “deadly dose” of austerity for the Eurozone, saying the government’s crisis strategy lacks a “growth impulse.”

Germany’s new government will have to steer the country through a dramatic shift to renewable energy and cope with the needs of an aging population; census figures show Germany has more people at least 65 years old and it has children.

Gerhard Schroeder, who served from 1998 until 2005, when he lost power to Angela Merkel in a close election, quickly pivoted to a post as a well-paid lobbyist for the Russian energy empire tied to his friend Putin.
The arrangement raised eyebrows. But it wasn’t until Schroeder, 77, raised criticism of Ukraine’s “saber-rattling” last month, just before Russia’s invasion — coupled with his subsequent refusal to distance himself from Putin — that his ties have become a source of national embarrassment. Many who view Schroeder as a Putin apologist are calling for him to step down from his executive positions with Russian energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft and the Nord Stream gas pipeline projects.
“It’s not all right for Gerhard Schroeder to hold these positions, and I think he should give them up,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a TV interview Thursday, shortly after Schroeder’s staff resigned en masse and he was unceremoniously removed from an honorary leadership position with his favorite soccer club, Borussia Dortmund. Schroeder has also been fired from several corporate oversight posts.
The fall from grace illustrates the sea change in German attitudes toward Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.
With a deep sense of guilt over their own country’s destructive and violent conduct in World War II — including its invasion of Russia — and the pacifist streak that ensued, many Germans had long argued that lasting peace and security in Europe were possible only by maintaining close ties to Russia. For some, that meant backing Moscow’s contention that NATO was pressing Russia with its agreements to grant membership to nations once within the Kremlin’s sphere of Eastern European influence.
California
Old anxieties returned last week as Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine and he warned foes who interfered of ‘consequences greater than any you have ever faced in history.’

Many Germans were thus willing to look away from Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and ignore Ukrainian objections over the Nord Stream 2 project connecting Russia to Germany beneath the Baltic Sea — pipelines that robbed Ukraine of badly needed gas transit fees.

Leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Scholz announced it would suspend the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 project. And in the days since the Feb. 24 invasion, Berlin has in effect tripled its defense spending and dropped its self-imposed ban on sending defensive weapons to Ukraine.
Several celebrities in Germany have been ostracized or publicly dismissed in the last week because they have declined to condemn Putin, who speaks fluent German, which he learned as a young intelligence agent stationed in the Communist East German city of Dresden during the Cold War.
The city of Munich removed Russia’s Valery Gergiev from his position as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic for declining to distance himself from Putin, a longtime friend. Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera star with close ties to Putin, has had her concerts at the Bavarian State Opera canceled.
There are an estimated 3.5 million Russian speakers in Germany, after about 2 million Russians immigrated to the country in the 1990s. Until now, they were often seen as welcome guests.
In Berlin and elsewhere, some Russian speakers have claimed in local media reports that they have been threatened. The window of a Russian food shop in Oberhausen was smashed and covered with anti-Russian graffiti; police said they believed a pro-Putin comment by a customer led to the attack.

World & Nation
A cease-fire in two southern Ukrainian cities meant to allow civilians to evacuate fell apart amid new Russian shelling, officials say.

At a Munich hospital, a doctor refused to treat a Russian patient, according to the Tageszeitung newspaper. The hospital later issued a statement critical of the action, saying it was a “personal act” by the doctor. The newspaper also said there were police reports around Germany of Russian speakers facing abuse on the streets, on social media and in schools.
“Unfortunately, there are outbursts of anger, hatred and despair that [are] unfair and leading to discrimination of innocent people,” said Bernd Fabritius, who heads the government office for minorities and ethnic Germans.
Some say they are afraid to speak Russian in public for fear of being ostracized, he said.
Berlin TV station RBB reported that students at the Russian-German school Lomonosov said they had faced abuse from German students. Anti-Russian graffiti was spray-painted on the school, the station said.
But the most attention has fallen on Schroeder, who has remained largely silent since the invasion began, except to post a comment on his LinkedIn account: “The war and the accompanying suffering for the people in Ukraine has to be ended as soon as possible. That’s the responsibility of the Russian government. There has been a lot of talk about mistakes and missed opportunities in the relationship between the West and Russia — on both sides.”
Juergen Hogrefe, who wrote a bestselling 2002 biography of Schroeder, said the ex-chancellor has tarnished his legacy by failing to distance himself from Putin after the war started — unfathomable behavior to the millions of Germans who thought wars in Europe would never happen again and who are now widely backing their government’s rush to reequip its armed forces, polls show.
“At the very [least], he should have distanced himself from Putin and given up his executive positions once the fighting began,” said Hogrefe. “The terrific political instincts he once had seem to have abandoned him this time around, and he has indeed become a figure of derision.

World & Nation
Russia’s war losses in Ukraine are far higher than Moscow admits, analysts believe. But will that spark anti-Putin sentiment?

“Schroeder won two German federal elections, and not without reason — he was charismatic and had a lot to offer for voters,” Hogrefe reflected. “He did a lot of important things for Germany, including modernizing the country and helping it break out of the conservative slumber era.”
Schroeder won reelection in 2002 against long odds — in part by standing up against President George W. Bush and refusing to join the “coalition of the willing” that invaded Iraq in 2003. Schroeder was part of a coalition, along with Putin and France’s Jacques Chirac, that rejected the war against Iraq and was dismissively labeled “old Europe” by then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. The friendship between Schroeder and Putin grew deeper during that period.
With assistance from Putin and his wife, Schroeder and his wife adopted two children in 2004 and 2006 from Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg. The adoptions were shrouded in secrecy and raised questions in part because Schroeder was older than 60 at the time. Media reports in Germany discussed whether the Schroeders had received preferential treatment.
Despite the worsening ostracism, there are some in Germany, especially in Schroeder’s center-left Social Democratic Party, who harbor hopes that he might be able to use his influence with Putin to help establish a cease-fire or even peace.
But others are doubtful that Schroeder has sway.
“I think it’s an illusion to think that Schroeder has any influence at all over Putin now,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “He might have been a good chancellor at the time by modernizing Germany, putting the economy on a path for growth and keeping the country out of Bush’s Gulf War. But he turned himself into a ‘useful idiot’ for Putin and ruined his own reputation. It’s doubtful that there’s any role for Schroeder. He’s yesterday’s man.”"
https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2011-jun-08-la-fg-obama-germany-20110608-story.html;2011-06-08;Obama, Merkel pledge to cooperate on Libya, economy - Los Angeles Times;"For two allies passing through rocky times, the leaders of the United States and Germany on Tuesday put on a show of unity at the White House, demanding that Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi relinquish power and pledging to cooperate on issues as diverse as the war in Afghanistan and the global economy.
President Obama welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Washington and used the occasion to reiterate his determination to see Kadafi ousted. Obama said Kadafi’s four-decade-long grip on power was nearing an end and described his regime as “hunkered down” with his forces pushed back.
“You’re seeing defections, oftentimes of some very high-profile members of the Kadafi government, as well as the military,” Obama said. “It is just a matter of time before Kadafi goes.”
Obama’s assessment was backed by Merkel, whose government has balked at any involvement in the NATO-led military campaign to drive the Libyan leader out. Germany joined Russia and China in abstaining from a March 17 U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force to protect Libyan civilians from Kadafi’s troops, a move that drew the ire of the Obama administration and other allies.
But on Tuesday, Merkel stood alongside Obama and lauded the progress “we” have made against the Kadafi regime and said its end appeared imminent.
“It is our joint will that this NATO mission is successful,” Merkel said. “This is important for the people in Libya, but it’s also important for NATO.”
Obama pressed Merkel for a commitment to help in Libya after hostilities end and Kadafi is removed. The German leader agreed to offer job and vocational programs as well as assistance in building civil institutions and training security forces.
Some observers saw the overture of a postwar role for Germany as a face-saving way to get the allies in sync on Libya.

“That was an artful formulation,” said Heather Conley, a Europe specialist at the Center for International and Strategic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington.
After its controversial decision to abstain from the Security Council resolution on Libya, the German government agreed to send more military resources to Afghanistan, a move widely seen as an attempt to placate the Obama administration.
The scenes of public unity were sealed with the choreography of a state dinner and the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, by Obama to Merkel.
But the differences between the two countries extend beyond how to eject Kadafi. On the issue of the troubled global economy, Obama and Merkel have diverged over whether spending or spending cuts would be the best route back to prosperity. And Obama warned against allowing the debt crisis threatening countries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal to worsen. With Europe’s biggest economy and deepest pockets, Germany has insisted upon harsh austerity measures in those countries as the price of a bailout.
“I am confident that Germany’s leadership, along with other key actors in Europe, will help us arrive at a path for Greece to return to growth, for this debt to become more manageable,” Obama said.
Merkel said Europe was responsible for solving its own economic problems, but also noted that solutions in a globalized economy require working in concert.
“The world is full of problems that we need to address,” Merkel said. “That’s a reality and you cannot have enough partners that work together with you in a coordinated way, and this is why this cooperation is so extremely important for our common future.”

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-27/germany-post-world-war-ii-ukraine-russia;2022-02-27;Germany shakes off timidity to emphatically back Ukraine  - Los Angeles Times;"Shocked out of its post-World War II pacifist zeitgeist  by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Germany was transforming itself with breathtaking speed Sunday to be among the leaders in arming Ukraine with weaponry and boosting its own defense spending.While more than 100,000 — organizers estimated the crowd at 500,000 — Germans cheered speakers denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his armed forces at a peace rally in the heart of Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced stunning plans at the Reichstag less than a mile away to spend an additional 100 billion euros (about $111 billion) for a special fund to re-equip its own military — on top of the 47 billion euros already in this year’s budget.
Increasingly embarrassed by its hesitancy to strongly support Ukraine and break away from its main energy supplier, Russia, the nation with a deep aversion to war following the horrors it inflicted in World War II is now planning to end its historical ban on sending arms into conflict zones.
Scholz said Germany would send 1,000 Panzerfaust 3 antitank weapons and 500 Fliegerfaust 2 antiaircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Germany also said it would finally allow other European countries to immediately send their own supplies of high-tech German-made weapons to Ukraine to aid in defense efforts against Russia.
“The times have changed,” Scholz told a special session of parliament Sunday. “The world is no longer the same. We will have to invest a lot more in our country’s security — to protect our freedom and to protect our democracy.”
World & Nation
Russian troops bear down on Kyiv and continue their thrust into Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. Putin puts nuclear forces on alert.

With its close business ties to Russia — and dependence on Russia for more than half of its natural gas supplies — Germany had come under increasing criticism from its European Union and NATO partners for dragging its feet on sending arms to help Ukraine defend itself. It had also been reticent in agreeing to tough economic sanctions, such as barring Russian banks from the SWIFT system of international payments.
Scholz, who succeeded Chancellor Angela Merkel just two months ago, finally dropped the refusal to export arms  to Ukraine on Saturday — before that, Germany declined to send any supplies other than 5,000 helmets.
Scholz opened the floodgates further Sunday with the surprise announcement that Germany would immediately raise its defense spending to the 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) promised to NATO partners in 2014 from 1.4% currently — after declaring for the last eight years that was not possible.

American presidents past and present, as well as NATO partners, had long pleaded that Germany spend a far larger share of its GDP on defense. Instead, Germany’s underfunded Bundeswehr has been plagued by parts shortages that have grounded most of the fighter jets in its air force and many of its tanks.

“The German government just did a 180-degree turn right before our eyes,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University, in an interview. “It’s remarkable to see the speed of the sea change on defense spending and towards arms exports into conflict zones.”
The chief of the German army acknowledged  last week that the Bundeswehr was ill-equipped for a war in Europe that he, like millions of others in Germany, never thought was possible until Russia’s unprovoked strike on its neighbor. “The Bundeswehr is standing there more or less empty-handed,” Lt. Gen. Alfons Mais wrote in comments on social media.
“For the first time since the end of the Cold War, it’s dawning on everyone that the country has an army that probably wouldn’t be able to protect them,” Jaeger said. “It was long so much easier and popular for elected officials to resist spending on defense. That’s all changing fast right now.”

Julius van de Laar, a political analyst in Berlin, said Germany had been under massive pressure from the rest of the EU to take tougher steps against Russia, even though it would mean putting aside its deeply pacifist leanings and the ghosts of its Nazi past.
Germany’s knotty reasoning in thwarting the EU from banning Russia from the SWIFT international banking system last week triggered a strong reaction against Berlin this weekend.
“Germany has been pushed into taking these steps by a surprisingly united EU,” said Van de Laar. “If we’re honest, Germany has been a laggard for decades on defense. And everyone has been telling Germany to stop being dependent on Russian gas. It’s late in the game but at least Germany moved in the right direction.”
At the peace rally in Berlin, most of the speakers and participants expressed relief that Germany was finally jumping over its shadow and strongly contributing to Ukraine’s defense.
“We’re here to show solidarity for Ukraine and we hope we can have a positive effect on ending the war,” said Marc Ahner, a 46-year-old jazz singer holding a sign calling for Putin to be jailed for war crimes. “I don’t think Putin will be intimidated by us. But it’s still important that we’re all here standing up for Ukraine and hopefully he’ll see all that support.”
Ahner added that, like many Germans, he was torn apart by the question of whether Germany,  which was responsible for so much death and destruction during World War II, should be involved in sending weapons.
“It’s a horrible bind for us to be in,” he said. “I really don’t know what is worse — to be accused of not helping Ukraine by not sending weapons or to be sending weapons into a war zone. But it’s probably the lesser of two evils.”
Hartmut Kramer, a  pensioner in Berlin who was born in 1944, near the end of World War II, said he has been taking part in peace marches for decades and opposed the stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in West Germany during the Cold War. But he said Germany has no choice now.
“I’m always against weapons,” said Kramer, who as a 1-year-old in Upper Silesia, now part of Poland, was among those fleeing an invading Russian army. “I’ve always believed in the peace movement. But nothing justifies what Putin is doing. It’s with a heavy heart that I would say sometimes there’s no other choice but to send weapons.”"
https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-27/putins-unified-stronger-europe-ukraine-invasion;2022-02-27;Putin fears of unified Europe becoming self-fulfilling prophecy - Los Angeles Times;"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brazen and unprovoked assault on Ukraine is fast turning his fears of a more resolute Europe, and potentially expanded NATO alliance, into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
NATO has come together behind stiff economic sanctions against Moscow. Finland and Sweden, after decades of neutrality, have signaled a new interest in joining the alliance while more autocratic members of the defense pact have excoriated Moscow.
And in an effort to shore up Ukraine’s defenses, the European Union for the first time will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday.
In short order, Europe’s leading powers have shifted into a position of heightened defensiveness toward Russia.
“We have to realize that we are now faced with a new normal for our security,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday in an interview on CNN, noting the beefed-up NATO troops’ presence in its eastern countries and weapons deliveries to Ukraine. “This is just the beginning of the adaptation that we need to do as a response to a much more aggressive Russia.”
On Sunday in Berlin, Germany’s new Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a rousing speech to parliament declaring that the country would spend more than 2% of its GDP on defense — Putin having accomplished what former President Trump sought for four years, and President Obama before him. Scholz also announced a special 100-billion euro fund (about $111 billion) to upgrade the country’s army, a fundamental shift by Europe’s most powerful nation after a long stretch of limited military spending in the decade after the European debt crisis.
World & Nation
Shocked out of its postwar lethargy by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Germany was transforming itself by arming Ukraine with weaponry and boosting defense spending.

Describing Russia’s war on Ukraine as “a turning point in the history of our continent,” Scholz told lawmakers, “it is clear that we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country.”
Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at Washington’s Brookings Institution, called the speech “Germany’s Nixon to China moment,” a reference to then President Nixon’s pivot from anti-communist hawk to taking his historic trip to China.
Similarly, Scholz’s speech was all the more significant coming from a Social Democrat, one known for fiscal austerity who came of age at the end of the Cold War, a time when many believed democracies were ascendant and would remain so.

“Many Germans mistook the fall of the Berlin Wall as a validation of their method, and they have hung on to that belief well beyond the point that it started being proven out of date otherwise by events,” Stelzenmüller said. “This is the end of that illusion, and the beginning of a new era in German foreign policy, and that is really a historic moment.”
Since taking office in December, Scholz, who served as finance minister to former Chancellor Angela Merkel, had seemed reluctant to take a firm stance toward Putin, given how reliant Germany’s economy is on Russia. But war breaking out in Europe has in short order altered security calculations and stiffened its leaders’ spines.

Scholz’s speech came as the EU also announced it would bar Russian planes from EU airspace and expel Russian state-owned media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik from all 27 members of the European bloc.
The EU said its defense aid package could even include fighter jets and that member states are willing to provide them. “We’re not talking about just ammunition,” EU’s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said. “We are providing more important arms to go to a war.”
“Just like President Putin has unified Ukraine against him and against Russia, President Putin has also unified the NATO alliance,” former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who also served at NATO, told SiriusXM radio.

Part of what has helped toughen resolve among European leaders like Scholz, as well as France’s Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was their realization of how blatantly Putin lied about his intentions in Ukraine. He claimed, to their faces until the last minute — and even now as his troops have mounted an amphibious assault and are sweeping into the north of Ukraine — he has no intention of invading the smaller neighbor.
“They were doing direct head of state diplomacy, and Putin lied to them,” said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a risk assessment firm in New York.
“Putin has behaved in a staggering, outrageous fashion to rip up what the Europeans thought were kind of inviolable norms,” he said. The shift among European leaders “shows that this is not about Ukraine, it’s a change in the global order that we have slipped into a new Cold War with Russia.”
World & Nation
The Ukraine crisis poses a big challenge for NATO, but experts say the conflict is not likely to spark a broader war between Russia and United States.

Scholz announced last week that Germany was halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a priority for Putin, who’d sought greater control of Europe’s energy resources. Saturday Berlin announced it would be sending weapons to support Ukraine, another shift in posture after Scholz’s initial offering months ago of sending 5,000 helmets had been widely derided. At the same time, Europe, along with Canada and the U.S., announced an agreement to sanction Russia’s central bank and to bar select Russian banks from the SWIFT international communications network used by banks around the world, a move that came about only after Germany overcame its reluctance.
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is at heart an attempt to revisit the end of the Cold War, to redress the westward drift of former Soviet republics and to regain additional territory that’s been independent from Russia for 30 years. Although the conflict is just days old, the reality of Russian tanks and missiles in Ukraine has shocked Europe’s leaders into action, as has Putin’s sinister language stating that he is “de-Nazifying” Kyiv by attempting to oust its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish.
World & Nation
As Russia moves ahead with its invasion of Ukraine, eyes are on Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected in 2019 after finding fame as a comedian.

“In his mind, he is re-fighting World War II, which suggests that everything is possible,” Stelzenmüller said. “I think that may have played a role in focusing policymakers’ minds in Berlin. To hear a Russian leader talk about a peaceful sovereign country in that way was truly galvanizing.”
Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday that it was “very probable” that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union on Monday in sanctioning Russia and freezing Russian assets in the Alpine country.
The leaders of Finland, which has an 830-mile land border with Russia, and Sweden indicated when the fighting began in Ukraine that they were newly inclined to consider applying for membership in NATO, the 30-nation security alliance that, under Article V of its charter, treats an attack on any member nation as an attack on all.
World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

Moreover, their leaders have since brushed off the Russian foreign ministry’s warning that their NATO membership would trigger “serious military-political consequences.” Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Saturday that “we’ve heard this before.” And Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said Friday that Sweden “itself, and independently, decides on our security policy line.”
Along with nearly every other European nation, Sweden has also committed in recent days to sending weapons and defense materiel to Ukraine.
Even NATO member states that are hardly democratic nations, like Turkey and Hungary, have joined in the strong condemnation of Russia and efforts to fortify Ukraine’s defense. On Sunday, Turkey’s foreign minister officially recognized Russia’s attacks on Ukraine as a “state of war” and said Ankara was implementing an international treaty allowing it to limit warships’ passage through the strategic Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits.
President Biden, remarking on revived support for NATO in an interview Friday, marveled at how Putin was “producing the exact opposite effect that he intended.”

World & Nation
In basements in Kyiv, Ukraine, civilians mix Molotov cocktails and otherwise prepare to fend off Russia’s invasion.

Biden has worked hard to keep democratic powers together in their response to Putin. Aware that Europe is under graver danger from Russia given its geographic proximity, and its greater economic reliance on Moscow, he has waited for consensus before pushing specific sanctions measures and deferred to European leaders to announce the elements of the West’s response.

That approach stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, who cozied up to Putin and bullied European leaders, even threatening to withdraw the U.S. from NATO altogether in 2018 when he felt member countries weren’t taking seriously his demand that they contribute more to their defense. Trump went as far as to order home some 12,000 troops stationed in Germany, a move many national security officials saw as punitive. Biden scuttled the plan just weeks after taking office last year.
Although Putin’s actions are strengthening unity across NATO and the European Union, these can still be precarious alliances with chances for a breakdown or new internal conflict. Daniel Serwer, a scholar at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who specializes in conflict, said the longer term resolution will likely continue with a Europe riven by what he called a “plywood curtain” — not as strong as the Iron Curtain but with a clear pro-West and pro-Russia divide.
“Europe ‘whole and free’ will remain a Western mantra,” he said. “It will not however be a serious proposition so long as Putin or someone of his ilk governs in Moscow.”
Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state.
A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.”
There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court.
Several organizations in California, as well as international aid groups, are helping refugees, wounded soldiers and others in and around Ukraine. Here’s how you can contribute.

While attending a Moscow business forum, Merkel had raised concerns about the two-year sentences for “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” handed down to two band members after they staged a “punk prayer” against Putin in a Moscow cathedral.

“Having to go to a prison camp for two years for that — this would not have happened in Germany,” Merkel was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

Putin countered her criticism by saying she knew too little about the provocative band and its offenses. “Does she know that before one of them strung up the effigy of a Jew and said Moscow should be rid of such people?” he told reporters after the meeting, according to the Russian state news agency. “I do not think modern Germany should support anti-Semitism.”

Putin was apparently referring to a demonstration four years ago by the Voina radical art collective, of which jailed Pussy Riot band member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova was a member. Her attorney, Mark Feigin, told Bloomberg the claim was “madness,” saying the demonstration was a portrayal of how minorities were treated by the government.

The Friday meeting came one week after German lawmakers backed a bracing resolution condemning the crackdown on Russian dissidents and civil society groups since Putin resumed the presidency this spring. Russia has expanded the definition of treason, imposed tight restrictions on protests and taken other steps to clamp down on critics, triggering growing concern from its trading partner.

Dismayed, the Russian government recently refused to deal with Andreas Schockenhoff, the German special envoy on Russian issues who wrote the resolution.

“President Putin’s relationship with Chancellor Merkel has never been warm, but this time the atmosphere could be described as a political ice age,” RIA Novosti columnist Fyodor Lukyanov wrote ahead of the summit. Nonetheless, “Vladimir Putin believes that economic considerations will outweigh ideology, just as they did 60, 40 or 25 years ago.”


Despite the sparring, Putin and Merkel oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements on energy, transport, the economy and other issues.

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jan-14-fg-iran14-story.html;2006-01-14;Bush, Merkel United on Iran - Los Angeles Times;"President Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in their first meeting since her election, presented a united front Friday against an Iranian nuclear program that Bush called “a grave threat to the security of the world.”
Their joint White House news conference carried important political symbolism, indicating growing U.S.-European cooperation on the question of Iran’s nuclear intentions on a day that saw Tehran issue new threats in the face of international condemnation.
Bush praised Germany’s cooperation but insisted that it was not yet time to talk about sanctions against Iran, a step that could reopen divisions between Washington and Berlin. Of the three European countries involved in negotiations with Tehran, Germany has been the least enthusiastic about joining the United States in pressuring Iran.
“I’m not going to prejudge what the United Nations Security Council should do,” Bush said.
A day earlier, officials of Germany, France and Britain said their two-year negotiations with Iran had reached a dead end, and they called for the issue to be sent to the Security Council for possible action.
Iran angered the European group earlier this week by breaking the U.N. seals on uranium enrichment equipment and declaring that the country would resume nuclear research.
In a further step, Iran’s foreign minister warned Friday that if the issue did go to the Security Council, Iran would stop working with U.N. inspectors monitoring the country’s nuclear activities. Manuchehr Mottaki said that a referral would have “consequences” for the West and that, in keeping with Iranian law, Tehran would have to halt its voluntary cooperation with inspectors.
Experts spent the day assessing the effect of the latest developments. Iran has signed but not ratified an international agreement that allows snap U.N. inspections of Iranian facilities. If Iran halts such voluntary cooperation, it will not be violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but it will be doing only the minimum to satisfy the treaty’s provisions.

Iran has insisted it is merely asserting its legal right to develop a civilian nuclear energy program.
U.S. officials and Europeans suspect the country’s leaders want to one day acquire weapons.
Bush said the United States and other Western nations had “made it abundantly clear to the Iranians that the development of the know-how and/or a nuclear weapon was unacceptable, because Iran armed with a nuclear weapon poses a grave threat to the security of the world.”
When Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, that it would resume nuclear research and development at its facility at Natanz, the United Nations anticipated maintenance work. But in a private letter to the agency, Tehran said it intended to move toward building a centrifuge plant to enrich uranium, a step needed to produce either fuel for power plants or material for a nuclear warhead.
Like Bush, Merkel, who took office Nov. 22, avoided detailing specific steps the U.N. might take against Iran.
She said she viewed recent discussions on Iran as a “very successful chapter” in U.S.-German relations.
Ray Takeyh, a specialist on Iran at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the joint statement was significant because it showed that “the wobbliest of the three European countries, the one with the most Iranian investments, has turned on the Iranians.”
“So we see an American-European solidarity that the Iranians could not erode, though they’ve been trying to during 2 1/2 years of negotiations,” Takeyh said.
The threat to cut off voluntary inspections should not technically be read as a move by Tehran to abandon treaty obligations, Takeyh said.
But in the current political environment, in which many countries are frustrated with Iran, “any sort of retreat from the voluntary obligations they took on ... are likely to be seen as an egregious violation of their nonproliferation commitments,” he said.
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, said Iran’s threat to end voluntary inspections actually may be an encouraging sign.
“It means they still expect to negotiate,” he said. “If they wanted to rupture relations with the rest of the world, they would have threatened more than that. In 18 years of noncompliance, this is pretty minor.”
Iran freely agreed to the inspections to support its claim that its nuclear program was meant to produce peaceful energy, not weapons.
Iran appeared to have been the main subject of the lengthy private meeting between Bush and Merkel.
Merkel said later that Germans abhorred as “totally unacceptable” statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad questioning Israel’s right to exist and describing the Holocaust as a myth.
On another issue, Bush and Merkel did not conceal their differences over the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists at the U.S.-run prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which Merkel has said she would like to see closed.
Bush said he believed that differences over the base arise because of misperceptions. He said he too would like to see “a way forward” on the prison, and suggested that it could come through trials of the detainees by military tribunals. The constitutionality of the tribunal system proposed by Bush has been challenged in federal court.
Bush insisted, “Guantanamo is a necessary part of protecting the American people. So long as the war on terror goes on, we will need to hold people” who would harm Americans.
After his private talk with Merkel, Bush said, “She’s smart. She’s plenty capable. She’s got the kind of spirit to her that is appealing. She loves freedom.”
Bush had a strained relationship with former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, especially over the Iraq war, and the White House has been eager for better ties with the 51-year-old Merkel, who was born in what was East Germany.
Many analysts say they don’t expect many policy changes in U.S.-German relations, in part because cooperation between the countries is already good in many areas.
They say there may be a significant improvement in mood and tone between the president and the new chancellor, who are closer in ideology than were Bush and Schroeder.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-07/biden-german-chancellor-scholz-white-house-visit;2022-02-07;Germany's new chancellor has wobbled on Ukraine. Biden's giving him a do-over - Los Angeles Times;"President Biden will host the new chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, at the White House on Monday, where the two will discuss how to aid Ukraine — and punish Russian President Vladimir Putin — if Russia invades the neighboring former Soviet republic.
The high-stakes meeting for two key leaders of NATO, the transatlantic alliance, comes as Putin is testing that long-standing partnership, and amid rising questions about Germany’s reliability on international security matters now that former Chancellor Angela Merkel is no longer at the helm.
Despite differences and Scholz’s early tentativeness in confronting Russia, the two leaders are determined to present a united front — even as Biden intends to raise issues that have been controversial for the new German government, such as economic sanctions that might be imposed on Russia and German reliance on Russia for its energy needs, a senior Biden administration official said Sunday evening.
The official, who requested anonymity to brief reporters before the meeting, noted that Germany is the second-largest financial contributor to Ukraine, after the United States. The administration is “confident” that if Russia undertakes an invasion, Germany will stand united with other  North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in ordering tough sanctions and otherwise helping Ukraine, the official said.
Scholz, however, speaking to German television earlier Sunday before departing Berlin, reiterated his refusal to send lethal arms to Ukraine, which faces the prospect of an imminent invasion with Putin having surrounded its borders with more than 100,000 troops.
Germany’s shipment of 5,000 helmets as its main contribution to Ukraine’s defense sparked intense criticism from allies and the German public.
Germany’s ambassador to the U.S. sent a frantic memo back to Berlin last week advising Scholz that Washington questions its ally’s reliability and that many Republicans believe, she wrote, that the new chancellor is “in bed with Putin.”
Last week, the U.S. Pentagon announced it was deploying 3,000 troops to Europe to join the NATO forces scrambling into position in the region either to deter Putin from invading or to mount a response if and when he does.

Biden has opted not to criticize Scholz publicly before his first visit to the White House. The two have met previously on the sidelines of other summits when Scholz was a member of Merkel’s Cabinet.
Politics
Even without firing a shot or moving a single soldier into Ukraine, Putin is able to achieve many of the goals that an invasion of the neighboring country could also, presumably, achieve. In fact, Putin may not need to invade at all.

During what’s likely to be a heavily scripted appearance with Biden in the East Room for a news conference following their meetings, Scholz is expected to use his biggest opportunity to date to reassure allies by making clear, when it comes to the situation in Ukraine, all options remain on the table.
“The most important thing for Olaf Scholz to demonstrate in Washington is that he understands what is at stake strategically — not just the sovereignty of Ukraine but the future of a peaceful, democratic and free Europe and of the transatlantic alliance,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow and Germany expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
Initially, Scholz had seemed to waver on sanctioning the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, calling it a “private-sector project,” but eventually shifted his stance in January and said, aiming to quell widespread criticism, that “all options” were on the table.
The administration official who briefed reporters Sunday sought to downplay differences over the controversial pipeline that will transport Russian fuel to Germany. The U.S. has warned the project could make Germany overly reliant on Moscow for energy and strongly urged the pipeline not be built. It has been completed but is not yet operational. And if Russia invades, the U.S. believes gas will not flow in the foreseeable future, the official said.
“One way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward” if Russia invades, the official said.
World & Nation
President Biden is deploying about 2,000 troops from the U.S. to Poland and Germany this week and shifting 1,000 from Germany to Romania.

Scholz has also been slow to distance himself from pro-Russia voices in Germany, most notably Gerhard Schröder, the last former chancellor from Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, who is close to Putin. Schröder has criticized Ukraine for “saber-rattling,” despite Russia amassing more than 100,000 troops on its borders, and he has just joined the board of Gazprom, Russia’s largest energy conglomerate.
Only last week did Scholz separate himself from Schröder, saying during an interview that “there is only one chancellor, and that is me.”
The Biden administration, as it has worked to rally NATO allies to respond to Putin with one voice, has sought to find additional energy resources for Europe in the event that Putin, reacting to potential sanctions, halts Russian gas exports in an effort to inflict economic pain.
“We are preparing not just for our initial response, but for counter-responses,” Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security advisor, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”"
https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jun-06-fg-merkel6-story.html;2007-06-06;Climate control now measure of Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"With the leaders of the major industrialized nations arriving at her doorstep today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure at home and abroad to persuade President Bush to accept strict measures to limit global warming.
Merkel’s reputation as a skilled foreign policy strategist is being scrutinized as members of the Group of 8 meet for three days at the Baltic Sea resort of Heiligendamm. The chancellor has made climate control the centerpiece of her summit agenda, a risky move that affords her little political cover if, as is likely, Bush refuses to budge.
Merkel’s rise in German politics has been predicated less on photo ops and campaign speeches than on the tactical negotiations of party politics. Officials say she will need those skills to wrest more concessions from Bush on climate change, and to convince her public that Berlin’s efforts to improve relations with Washington have borne more that just rhetoric.
The challenge facing Merkel, a physicist who grew up in the former communist East Germany, is narrowing the gap between Bush’s proposal calling on industrialized nations to voluntarily limit climate-altering gases and her ambitious goal to set guidelines and timetables to reduce carbon emissions. Many European officials regard Bush’s plan, which was announced last week with no specific targets, as a preemptive strike to weaken Merkel’s position.
Critics suggest that the chancellor’s stature as an influential international voice is in jeopardy over her government’s inability to forge a global warming deal before she, Bush and the leaders of the other G-8 nations -- Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, Russia and France -- begin talks on subjects including the environment and aid to Africa.
The G-8 summit will “be the moment of [Merkel’s] greatest foreign policy defeat,” wrote the Financial Times Deutschland. “It is the federal government’s own fault that it has failed with its plan to get the G-8 to agree to more ambitious climate targets.... Merkel was too late in recognizing the real extent of her influence on the international stage.”
Other commentators place the blame on what they view as Washington’s lack of flexibility on environmental issues.
“The U.S. government has isolated itself to a large extent on the climate issue,” Torsten Riecke wrote in Handelsblatt. “Not even Bush’s favorite European, [British Prime Minister] Tony Blair, supports the U.S.'s obstructive stance. Bush’s move is an attempt to postpone the issue once more.”

Merkel’s aim is to advance the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations plan to cut greenhouse gases, which the U.S. has refused to sign. The chancellor is calling for global warming to rise no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050 and for nations to reduce their emissions by then to half of what they were in 1990. The plan has largely been embraced by Europe, but U.S. negotiators have said Washington opposes such measures.
Bush’s proposal urges the U.S. and other countries to start a campaign to limit greenhouse gases and set long-term goals for reductions that include technological innovations.
The Bush administration has long opposed mandatory emissions targets, fearing they would hurt industry and slow the economy.
Merkel has begun to muffle summit expectations. She won conditional support from Blair and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper but said Sunday that an agreement among all eight members was unlikely. She pledged not to significantly alter her proposal, especially the 3.6-degree ceiling.
“We will conduct highly constructive talks with all of our partners and nobody will be forced into a corner,” Merkel told Der Spiegel on Sunday. She added: “One thing is clear. We must agree on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, as part of the process led by the United Nations. There will certainly be other meetings and initiatives before then. They can even be helpful. What matters is that they all eventually merge into the U.N. process. This is nonnegotiable.”
German government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said Tuesday that “we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording” regarding the summit’s final statement on global warming.
The matter has agitated U.S.-German relations, which had been improving since Merkel came to power in 2005.
The Iraq war and the treatment of suspected Islamic militants in U.S. custody have kept Bush’s ratings low in opinion polls across Europe. But Merkel’s pragmatic style and affinity for the U.S. have led to greater cooperation with Washington, including Berlin sending more troops to Afghanistan.
German politicians expected the U.S. to respond in kind and move closer to Merkel’s emissions plan, so as not to embarrass the summit’s host.
But an editorial in the conservative Die Welt suggested that the showdown over climate control could still benefit the chancellor, even without a Bush compromise.
“It’s a paradox that this failure can lead to a double success,” the paper stated. “By defying her friend George, the most powerful man in the world, Merkel gets rid of her image as Bush’s lap dog. And with her determination on climate protection she proves that it doesn’t take a Green [Party politician] to fight for a green subject.... On the eve of the summit, Merkel has successfully found her role as a herald for a better world.”

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-08/explainer-russias-nord-stream-2-pipeline;2022-02-08;Explainer: What's Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe? - Los Angeles Times;"President Biden has threatened to block the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine.
The undersea pipeline is a conduit for Russian gas to flow directly to Europe via Germany and is complete but not yet operating. It has become a major target as Western governments try to deter a Russian attack on its neighbor.
In the past, it has been a source of tension between the U.S., which opposed the project, and Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said all options were on the table but avoided mentioning Nord Stream 2 specifically at a news conference with Biden in Washington.
If Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said Monday. Scholz stressed the need to keep some ambiguity about sanctions to press Russia to de-escalate.
Here are key things to understand about the pipeline:

A 764-mile-long natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, running from Russia to Germany’s Baltic coast.
It would double the capacity of an earlier Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters of gas a year and bypass Ukraine and Poland, which would lose transit fees. They also said the project would increase Russia’s leverage over Europe.
The pipeline has been filled with gas but is not operating yet pending approval by Germany’s utility regulators and the European Commission.
World & Nation
World leaders are trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope that could mean the difference between a Russian incursion and an uneasy peace in Ukraine.



State-owned producer Gazprom says it will meet Europe’s growing need for affordable natural gas and complement existing pipelines through Belarus and Ukraine.
European countries import most of their gas and get about 40% from Russia. Nord Stream 2 would offer an alternative to Ukraine’s aging system, lower costs by saving transit fees paid to Ukraine and Poland and avoid episodes such as brief 2006 and 2009 gas cutoffs over price and payment disputes between Russia and Ukraine.
Opposition from the U.S. and allies such as Poland and Ukraine to the project predates the Biden administration. They said it gives Russia the possibility of using gas as a geopolitical weapon.
Biden waived sanctions against the pipeline’s operator when it was almost complete in return for an agreement from Germany to take action against Russia if it used gas as a weapon or attacks Ukraine. But the U.S. still thinks Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea. Meanwhile, Scholz, who took the helm in Germany in December, backed the project as Angela Merkel’s finance minister, and his Social Democratic Party supported it.
Although he has avoided referring to Nord Stream 2 specifically, Scholz says that Russia would face “severe consequences” and that sanctions must be ready ahead of time.
The U.S. could impose heavy financial sanctions — penalizing anyone or any company that does business involving the pipeline, in effect scaring away banks and businesses and making it impossible for the pipeline to operate.

Biden hasn’t said if that’s the route he might pursue. Asked Monday how the U.S. would stop something that’s under German control, Biden only said, “I promise you, we’ll be able to do it.” Scholz added, “You can be sure that there won’t be any measures in which we have a differing approach. We will act together jointly.”
In Congress, Republicans and Democrats — in a rare bit of agreement — have long objected to Nord Stream for the leverage it gives Russia over other European countries. They have been split for months on whether to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 now or only if Russia invades. Bill backers have refused to say what compromise they might be working on.
In Germany, the approval process has been presented as strictly a legal decision, not a political one, raising questions about what mechanism could be used if there’s a Russian attack. In Europe, sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 were agreed upon at the European Union level.

Not immediately or directly. Since regulators won’t approve it for months, the pipeline cannot help meet heating and electricity needs this winter amid the continent’s gas shortage. Gazprom could, if it chose, send more gas through existing pipelines.
The winter crunch has continued to feed concerns about Russia and gas. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the shortage underscores the need for quick Nord Stream 2 approval. Russia held back from short-term gas sales — even though it fulfilled long-term contracts with European customers — and failed to fill its underground storage in Europe.
Some analysts say Russia had to fill its own winter reserves first, and Gazprom has stressed its role as a reliable long-term supplier. Whatever the motivation, Putin’s comments did little to relieve concerns that Russia is inclined to use gas for political leverage.
Politics
Perhaps his new enthusiasm for diplomacy last week meant Putin isn’t bent on war after all.


That’s oversimplifying. Although Europe needs Russian gas, Gazprom also relies on the European market for sales to support Russian government budgets. And the EU has been able to force Gazprom to comply with many of its anti-monopoly rules in recent years.
That interdependence is why many think Russia won’t cut off gas to Europe even if the conflict over Ukraine escalates, and Russian officials have underscored they have no intention to do that.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-16/harris-heads-to-major-security-conference-to-reassure-a-europe-still-on-edge;2022-02-17;Harris heads to major security conference to reassure Europe - Los Angeles Times;"Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Germany on Thursday to meet this weekend with Ukraine’s president and anxious European allies, who remain uncertain whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will pull back from the brink of a destabilizing war with Ukraine, Biden administration officials said.
Harris’ visit to the Munich Security Conference, where she will lead a delegation that includes Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, represents the latest high-level attempt by the White House to demonstrate unity with the leaders of Western nations and Ukraine seeking to avert what could spark the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II.
Harris plans to meet Saturday with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said a senior administration official previewing the trip on background for journalists. The official acknowledged, however, that the situation remained fluid given the possibility that Zelensky may opt not to leave Ukraine with Russia in position to attack.
Russian officials are not expected to attend the conference, an annual gathering of the world’s top national security officials, and participation by Ukrainian officials is uncertain.
The show of unity by the United States and its European partners is part of a strategy aimed at reminding Putin of the potential for economic and diplomatic isolation should he order an invasion.

World & Nation
The claimed pullback continues a drawdown of troops that Moscow says began a day earlier, but NATO says the withdrawal has not been verified.

“The unity issue — that is the core diplomatic objective, or one of the core diplomatic objectives, at this point,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution think tank. “If Putin is dissuaded from invading, it will almost certainly be because of this unified approach.”
The need for a cohesive response by U.S. allies is a point that Harris plans to underscore in a speech she plans to deliver at the conference on Saturday, the administration official said. She’ll also look to affirm the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, NATO and the broader democratic world order in meetings on the sidelines of the conference.
On Friday, the vice president is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, a trio of Baltic state leaders and a congressional delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). She’ll also meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday.
All of Harris’ meetings, the senior administration official said, will aim to “ensure that the transatlantic community, the NATO alliance ... speak with one voice that is strong and resolute.”
The last time the world leaders, diplomats and defense officials met at the Munich Security Conference, two years ago, conversations focused on the theme of “Westlessness” — a lack of cohesion and shared focus among the world’s democratic powers.
After last year’s conference was canceled due to the pandemic, attendees will return to Bavaria’s storied capital this weekend with the West as aligned as it has been in some time. That’s largely in response to Moscow’s threatening behavior regarding Ukraine.
“It’s very clear this has unified the West; it’s just not clear it’s going to last,” said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk assessment firm based in New York.
By drawing things out and potentially making concessions, he said, Putin could be looking to create daylight between allies about its endgame with Ukraine.
“The West hasn’t made very many mistakes,” said Bremmer, who will attend the conference. “He wants to give them more chances to make mistakes.”
Putin’s buildup of troops along Ukraine’s border was in part an effort to test the West’s seemingly fraying alliance, seeking to extort a guarantee from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that it would never admit Ukraine to the alliance, and the timing was no accident, experts say.
Putin took action during a turbulent time for NATO members — the U.S. executed a chaotic and controversial withdrawal from Afghanistan in August, French President Emmanuel Macron has been openly discussing “strategic independence” for his country, and longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down from office in December.
“That’s why he escalated this now,” Bremmer said. “But he’s misjudged all that.”

Putin signaled earlier this week that he could be recalibrating in the face of a remarkably unified West. NATO countries have aligned behind efforts to boost Ukraine’s defenses and deter Russia with the threat of severe economic sanctions and the dismantling of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. The pipeline, once operational, will increase Putin’s control of Europe’s energy resources.

In recent days, Putin has signaled that he is ready to resume negotiations and that he will be pulling back some of the more than 130,000 troops outside Ukraine.
In a speech Tuesday, Biden encouraged more talks and troop withdrawals, but cautioned that it was too soon to take Putin at his word, noting that an invasion remained “a very real possibility.”
On Wednesday, Blinken said in a television interview that “unfortunately there’s a difference between what Russia says and what it does, and what we’re seeing is no meaningful pullback.”
“On the contrary,” the secretary of State said, “we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border.”
Another senior administration official, briefing reporters Wednesday evening, said Russia had actually increased its troop presence by roughly 7,000 this week.
If troops do eventually move off the border, it “doesn’t mean Putin has given up on trying to pull Ukraine back into its orbit,” said Steven Pifer, a retired diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine during the Clinton administration. “There’s always going to be this possibility that the Russians can do this a year from now or longer [than that]. But it takes them a couple of months to ramp up forces, and they have learned now that they can’t do it in secret.”
If Putin opts against an invasion, he could still engage in cyberattacks against Ukraine and subtler actions that could be more difficult for the West to assess and respond to.
“A full-on invasion makes it simple for the allies,” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center. “But gray-zone warfare, which Putin is good at, leaves room for the kinds of fissures and cracks he wants to see in the NATO alliance.”
The Biden administration, badly bruised by its missteps in Afghanistan last summer, has taken a different approach to the situation in Eastern Europe. In Afghanistan, President Biden‘s unilateral decision to draw down troops confounded allies in the 20-year war who were not fully consulted; then he scoffed at security concerns about the government’s weakness as it was swiftly overtaken by the Taliban.

World & Nation
Some Ukrainians are starting to wonder whether their neophyte leader has the smarts and strength to lead them through a moment of peril.

In tackling the crisis in Ukraine, Biden has worked to communicate clearly and often with other NATO allies. And as Putin has mobilized resources in preparation for a possible invasion, Biden and his aides have repeatedly sounded the alarm, focusing attention on Russian movements, seeking to deny Putin the element of surprise, and reiterating warnings about the consequences for Putin should he invade.
“They have done an excellent job of working with the allies, and it’s paid off in that you have a pretty unified NATO position,” Pifer said. But, he continued, Putin’s characteristic unpredictability — and avowed desire to make Ukraine part of Russia — means “you can never really turn your back.”
The conference offers Harris, who has met over the last year with numerous heads of state, a highly prestigious forum to build relationships and boost her foreign policy bona fides. But the backdrop of potentially imminent conflict in Europe and her general lack of involvement in the administration’s strategy and messaging on Russia and Ukraine is less than ideal. The audience in Munich may be more interested in what Blinken has to say on the subject.
“Nobody’s pretending she’s calling any shots on this,” Bremmer said. “We’re in the middle of a real crisis. She’s not a principal.”
Asked earlier this week about Blinken’s attendance, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said only that Harris “is a vital and important representative for the United States and our values and our intentions at this point in the world.”"

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-feb-05-fg-merkel5-story.html;2007-02-05;Merkel rises, steady as she goes - Los Angeles Times;"She is at her most convincing beyond the camera’s flash, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel can work a room, turning pragmatism into an erudite, diplomatic charm that has made her Europe’s most commanding leader.
She is neither brash nor rash; as a student she deliberated 45 minutes before jumping off a diving board. But despite her quiet manner, Merkel is rising in stature as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac are set to leave office. She is not as telegenic as Blair, or as suave as Chirac, but her sober intellectual confidence is increasingly influential.
Berlin has improved ties with the Bush administration even though Merkel has refused to send troops to Iraq and has criticized the treatment of terrorism suspects in U.S. custody. Her government is attempting to revive Middle East peace talks, negotiate an end to the crisis over Iran’s uranium enrichment program, improve links with China and build a unified Europe less driven by the traditional German-French axis.
“She does not like grand visions. She’s a pragmatic politician,” said Gerd Langguth, who wrote a biography on Merkel in 2005. “The atmosphere of how Germany is talking to world leaders has changed. Blair is a political lame duck, so is Chirac. Italy and Spain are not very stable. So for the moment, the German chancellor is more important.”
Merkel is using this clout to urge the continent’s governments to be aggressive about reform and globalization, pushing especially for the loosening of regulations on business and the strengthening of transatlantic economic bonds to compete with India and other rising trading powers. She has cautioned Europe not to retract into a shell of protectionism.
The warning comes as the German economy is emerging from years of slow growth and high unemployment. Consumer confidence is up, and Germany, the world’s third-largest economy, is benefiting from cuts to labor protection and social programs -- safety net elements that had been championed by Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder. But Merkel, who has been in office 14 months, fears the momentum will slip if more reforms aren’t passed to keep Germany competitive in global markets.
The chancellor leads a contentious coalition government whose liberals and conservatives have produced no significant domestic reforms. Such deadlock perhaps makes it politically safer for Merkel to dabble in the world’s problems, such as meeting with rock star Bono at the recent World Economic Forum in Switzerland, than to try to calm angry pensioners or thousands of German doctors striking for higher salaries.
Merkel’s prominence on the international stage follows Schroeder’s insistence that the generation of Germany’s politicians that came of age after World War II should reassert the nation’s voice in world affairs. The two leaders’ styles, however, are different; the current chancellor prefers backroom deliberations to public schmoozing, and bar graphs to catchy one-liners.

“I think Mrs. Merkel is more academic, looking at dossiers and acting only after she understands a problem,” said Andreas Maurer, an analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “Schroeder was much more oriented to media exercises ... and acted much more on emotions.”
One of Merkel’s foreign policy goals is a European Union that gives a more influential role to the newer, weaker members of the alliance. Once dominated by Paris and Berlin, the EU, which has grown to 27 countries, these days represents a continent of looser borders and more diverse voices.
Germany holds the EU’s rotating presidency until July, and Merkel has been traveling to Western capitals, such as Brussels, and to former communist capitals, such as Prague, to find consensus on ratifying a European Constitution to fit everyone.
“The exclusivity of the Franco-German relationship is over,” Maurer said. “Merkel is much more inclusive of other countries.”
Berlin’s strategy also has shifted toward Washington. Schroeder was a fierce critic of the Iraq war and other U.S. policies, but Merkel, who has met President Bush six times since 2005, has appeared more sensitive to European-American relations. The change indicates that the continent’s ties to the United States, which were strong during the Cold War, are just as strategic in a new era of terrorism and globalization.
“The U.S. is still the European Union’s most important trade partner,” Merkel said in Switzerland. “We are also the most important investment partners for each other.”
Security concerns have led the chancellor to be active in the Middle East. Her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is a key negotiator, along with counterparts on the U.N. Security Council, in the effort to defuse tensions over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He also has been working with Washington, the United Nations, Russia and the EU to push for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
“We know that resolving this conflict or at least making progress would also have an effect on all the other regional conflict,” Merkel said last month after a meeting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Unlike Schroeder, who was a friend of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin -- a circumstance that many analysts say muted German criticism of Moscow’s war in Chechnya and human rights record -- Merkel is skeptical of Russia. Last year, Merkel, who is a physicist and the daughter of a Protestant minister, irritated the Kremlin when she met with rights groups and opposition figures during a visit to Moscow.
“Merkel is fluent in Russian and she was raised in the former communist” East Germany, Maurer said. “She is using her biography to speak to Europe about Russia.”
The chancellor refers to Russia as a strategic partner, but she is unlikely to speak of Putin as a “flawless democrat” the way Schroeder did.
She publicly rebuked Moscow several weeks ago when she questioned its reliability as an energy partner after a pipeline dispute between Russia and Belarus temporarily cut oil supplies to Germany.
Germany’s largest newspaper, Bild, credited Merkel with bringing “soberness” to Berlin’s relations with Moscow. “We depend on oil and gas from Russia, and Russia needs us as buyers.... Germany’s interests are in good hands with Merkel. She banks less on feeling than on clear reason,” Bild said.

The MSCI All-Country World Index retreated 0.2% at 5 p.m. in New York. The yield on Italy’s 10-year bonds climbed above 7.1%. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 15 governments rose two basis points to 381. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.2% and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures rose 0.3%.
U.S. markets were closed today for Thanksgiving. The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.3347.
Euro bonds are “not needed and not appropriate,” Merkel said at a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Strasbourg, France. More than $4 trillion has been erased from the value of equities worldwide this month as rising borrowing costs in the euro-area stoked concern the debt crisis will derail growth.
“The market sees a no’ and reacts to it,” said Martin Huefner, chief economist at Assenagon GmbH in Munich, which manages more than $4.7 billion of client assets. “We’re going to see a deterioration of equity markets in the coming months to the point where something will have to be done. The market would be euphoric to get euro bonds. Apparently the pressure is not big enough yet.”
The euro weakened 0.2% against the yen and was little changed versus the Swiss franc. The yen advanced against all but two of its 16 major counterparts.

The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond climbed 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.11%, while similar- maturity French debt yields rose three basis points to 3.72%.
Portugal’s bonds fell, with 10-year note yields climbing 90 basis points to 12.21% after Fitch Ratings cut the nation’s credit grade one step to BB+, the highest junk status.

Germany’s 10-year bond yield rose as much as 12 basis points to 2.26% before trading five basis points higher at 2.2%. Two-year note yields increased three basis points to 0.47%.
The Munich-based Ifo institute’s German business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.6 from 106.4 in October. Economists expected a decline to 105.2, according to the median of 40 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
The Stoxx 600 benchmark gauge closed at the lowest level since Oct. 4. Oil and health-care stocks led declines while basic-resources and automakers advanced.
Raiffeisen Bank International AG gained 5.9^ after eastern Europe’s third-biggest lender reported profit that topped analyst estimates. Dixons Retail Plc jumped the most since May, advancing 7.1% after the U.K.'s largest electronics retailer reported a smaller first-half loss than analysts had predicted.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.8% after S&P signaled it may be getting closer to lowering Japan’s sovereign credit rating. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s administration hasn’t made progress in tackling the public debt burden, S&P said.
Canadian stocks fell, with the benchmark index retreating 0.8%. Volume was 75% below its average in the past 180 days due to the U.S. market holiday.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.3% and Brazil’s Bovespa gauge advanced 0.6% while Russia’s Micex Index lost 0.8%. Banks led Turkey’s ISE National 100 Index down 2.9% after Merkel’s comments.

https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-xpm-2011-nov-29-la-fg-europe-euro-rescue-20111130-story.html;2011-11-29;In Europe debt crisis, markets and masses wait for Merkel to blink - Los Angeles Times;"In the white-knuckle game of chicken that the euro crisis has increasingly become, three players are staring one another down: the markets, the masses and Merkel.
As time runs out to save the shared currency and avert global economic pandemonium, the question of who will blink first is likely to become clear over the next few days while European leaders prepare for a crucial summit. All three players are refusing to budge, making it difficult to tell who will yield or whether their intransigence will result in mutually assured destruction.
On Tuesday, finance ministers from the 17 Eurozone countries agreed in Brussels on how to increase the firepower of their bailout fund and on releasing about $11 billion in emergency loans to Greece so that it can avoid bankruptcy. The meeting was a prelude to the leaders’ summit next week at which France and Germany are expected to press for rewriting the rule book in order to knit the Eurozone more tightly together, centralizing control over national budgets and finances to ensure that members of the club stick to the rules on debts and deficits.
With time running short and investors scrambling for the exits, European leaders — especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel — are under intense pressure to do more than push for stronger fire safety codes when the building is already in flames.
At the same time, angry citizens are thronging Europe’s streets to put politicians on notice of their intent to fight the harsh austerity measures that the markets and international finance officials have demanded. Governments or leaders of six European countries have fallen within the last year because of the debt crisis.
The markets, meanwhile, have turned up the heat dramatically in the last month, showing their disdain for officials’ latest crisis battle plan by rushing to unload sovereign debt and making it prohibitively expensive for governments, even those in the core of Europe, to borrow money.
At a bond auction Tuesday, Italy was forced to pay interest rates nearing 8%, about the same sky-high level that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts. Borrowing costs have also shot up for Spain, Belgium and even France.
Along with dissatisfaction, the markets have demonstrated fickleness. Investors know Italy is too big to rescue; pushing it into bankruptcy would trigger a worldwide financial calamity that would only boomerang on the investors themselves. Yet they continue to drive up Rome’s borrowing costs, even though the fundamentals of the Italian economy remain the same as they were a few months ago, when the interest rate on the country’s bonds was half what it was Tuesday.

And arguably, Italy is in a better position now to implement much-needed structural reforms under its new technocratic leader, Mario Monti, who replaced the man widely seen by the markets as an obstacle to an economic overhaul, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The same is true in Spain, where a party committed to fiscal rigor and reform just won a landslide election.
“There are one or two positive aspects that the markets aren’t looking at right now,” said Julian Callow, chief European economist for Barclays Capital.
Instead, investor panic, in many ways self-reinforcing, has reached such a pitch that even a bond auction for Germany, the economic lodestar of Europe, had dismal results last week, despite the fact that no rational actor believes Berlin is in any danger of turning into a deadbeat nation.
Callow said the markets’ reaction is due partly to their diminished confidence that Europe can get its act together in time to resolve the debt crisis.
And that, virtually everyone agrees, comes down to Merkel, Germany’s leader.
The markets have been frustrated by her flat-out refusal to consider measures they think would at least stanch the bleeding if not heal the wound. Foremost among these are allowing the European Central Bank to buy up the bonds of troubled nations and issuing “eurobonds,” collective debt backed by all 17 Eurozone nations.
Eurobonds were reportedly on the agenda for discussion at Tuesday’s meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, but no breakthrough was announced. Officials said only that Greece would receive the rescue loans it needed to prevent a messy default and that the Eurozone would increase the firepower of its bailout fund by insuring up to 30% of government debt.
The zone will also explore the possibility of contributing more money to the International Monetary Fund, which could then be repackaged as aid to troubled euro countries such as Spain and Italy that are having difficulty raising money in the commercial markets, said Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg.
An idea similar to eurobonds to ease the debt crisis is to create “elite” bonds backed by the zone’s most creditworthy countries, such as Germany and Austria, to help prop up wobbly ones, though with stringent conditions attached.
But Merkel has said several times in recent days that such ideas are non-starters. She insists instead that fiscally errant countries reform their ways and is concentrating her energy on changing Eurozone treaties to allow closer fiscal union and central oversight of member nations’ budgets, even though analysts warn that the currency binding them together might implode first.
“She can be quite stubborn,” said Gerd Langguth, a political scientist at the University of Bonn and author of a biography of Merkel, Germany’s first female leader. “She always makes decisions one step at a time and doesn’t necessarily take account of the big picture.”
Merkel has refused to be cowed by the fluctuations of the markets, perhaps because Germany is in far better economic shape than its neighbors and because she thinks a bitter dose of market medicine might do wayward nations some good.
“This is about the primacy of politics. This is about the limits of the markets,” she declared last year, a view that appears to inform her refusal to back down now.
But politicians themselves are limited by their voters, and Europe’s masses have complicated attempts to put a brake on the crisis as the euro skids to the edge of the precipice.
Resistance to the harsh austerity measures prescribed by Germany, the International Monetary Fund and European Union officials is rife across the continent. As the Eurozone tips back into a possible double-dip recession, public anger is bound to rise as countries as diverse as Finland and Malta are expected to adopt a German-style model of fiscal rectitude.
Last week, Portugal was brought to a standstill by a nationwide strike, in a country where such large-scale unrest is unusual. Huge protests erupted in Italy this month over government spending reductions. Trade unions in Belgium are expected to stage demonstrations against budget cuts Friday.
Discontent is evident even outside the Eurozone: Britain, which has its own currency, is bracing for a strike by up to 2 million government workers Wednesday. George Osborne, the finance minister, acknowledged Tuesday that Britain would have to keep cutting spending until 2017 to bring down its deficit and that more state jobs would be lost, but he insisted that the country could not back away from its austerity plans.
In Greece, the epicenter of the debt crisis, yet another general strike — the 20th in less than two years — is scheduled for Thursday. Public-sector workers, angry over plans for widespread layoffs, have been staging wildcat occupations of government buildings in Athens.
“We’re entering a period of severe social unrest,” said Vassilis Xenakis, a leading member of a union representing about 750,000 civil servants. “They must realize the pain permeating society. Austerity is ripping through the social fabric of the country.”

Obama will present Chancellor Angela Merkel with the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor for civilians, while First Lady Michelle Obama plans an event highlighting the importance of women in diplomacy. Merkel is the first female head of government to visit the Obama White House.
But in an interview with a German newspaper Monday, President Obama said he plans to bring up the popular movements threatening autocratic regimes in the Middle East, singling out Libya in particular. Germany is staying out of the NATO campaign against Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi.
“I look forward to discussing with the chancellor how we can enhance our work together to more effectively address the changes underway in the region, including in Libya,” Obama told Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel. “This is an historic moment of opportunity.”
The visit comes as the allies enter their third month of military action to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and pressure Kadafi to step down. Germany is pressing for a negotiated end to the fighting, and has sent more troops to Afghanistan in a show of support for the transatlantic alliance.
At the same time, the Obama and Merkel administrations have pursued different strategies in response to the global economic crisis, with Berlin choosing extreme austerity measures over Washington’s attempts to spur the economy through spending.
“We’re all working on finding the right balance between providing the support the economy needs for a strong recovery and taking the steps that are required to guarantee our long-term fiscal sustainability,” Obama said in the Tagesspiegel interview.
On Tuesday, the two leaders will hold a one-on-one meeting, as well as a joint news White House conference with the German and American press.

Merkel’s trip to Washington is not technically considered an official “state” visit, because she is the head of the German government rather than the head of state, a title that belongs to the German president. Nevertheless, the Obamas will receive her with all the pomp and circumstance of a state visit, greeting her with a review of American troops and an elaborate state dinner.
In addition, Merkel will join Michelle Obama in an event with local young women to talk about women in diplomacy. Brooke Anderson, chief of staff to the National Security staff, will join the two in meeting with girls from two local high schools and members of the Girl Scouts.
Obama and Merkel also dined together Monday night at an upscale Georgetown restaurant.

“An institution like Guantanamo can and should not exist in the longer term,” Merkel told the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, days before her first visit to the United States. “Different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners.”
Merkel has vowed to repair ties with the United States, severely strained over the U.S.-led Iraq invasion, which her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, strongly opposed.
But there was no sign she would hesitate to speak out on issues when there is disagreement. Asked about her comments at a news conference later in the day, she said, “That’s my opinion and my view, and I’ll say it elsewhere just as I have expressed it here.”
She said she would not demand the immediate closure of the detention center when she meets President Bush on Friday. “My talks with leaders of other countries don’t consist of my expressing demands, but of exchanging views,” she said.
There is widespread skepticism in Germany about the way the United States is conducting its campaign against terrorism, compounded by the recent scandal over the CIA’s alleged abduction and detention of German citizen Khaled Masri -- viewed by many to be a mistake.
She also commented on relations with Russia and the European Union. Merkel described relations with the United States as a “friendship,” but said the term “strategic partnership” would be more fitting to describe Germany’s ties with Moscow.
“I don’t think we share as many of the same values yet with Russia as we do with the United States,” she said. “But we have a huge interest in seeing Russia develop in a sensible way.”

Merkel, who will meet President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow days after her Washington trip, often criticized Schroeder for forging “exclusive” ties with Russia at the expense of relations with smaller European countries."
https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-07/biden-scholz-meeting-ukraine;2022-02-07;Biden vows to end gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"President Biden, alongside Germany’s new chancellor, pledged on Monday that their two nations are “united” in their efforts to deter Russia from invading Ukraine following their first formal meetings at the White House.
Strikingly, Biden promised he and other allies  “will bring an end” to the controversial Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany if Russia attacks its neighbor, a former Soviet republic.
“If Russia invades, there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said during a news conference after two hours of talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
But even as Scholz and Biden sought to convey a united front, the German leader would not explicitly back up Biden’s threat. He promised only there would be no daylight between Germany, which controls the pipeline, and its NATO partners.
“We will be united. We will act together,” said Scholz, whose commitment to deterring Russian aggression had been in recent weeks questioned by allies in light of his reluctance to send serious military aid to Ukraine and past comments suggesting that Nord Stream 2, as “a private-sector project,” might not be sanctionable.
“All the necessary steps will be taken by us together,” he said.
When a German reporter asked Scholz why he wouldn’t try to put to rest nagging questions about Germany’s reliability as a NATO ally by explicitly backing up Biden’s threat to halt Nord Stream 2, Biden stepped in to dispel any sense that the two leaders weren’t aligned.
“Germany’s completely reliable,” Biden said. “I have no doubt about Germany.”
The public show of unity continued Biden’s ongoing effort to bolster the NATO coalition in response to the aggression by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in preparation for a possible invasion. Biden and Scholz were clear in expressing their broad agreement on a two-track approach of diplomacy and deterrence.

Although both agreed a diplomatic resolution is their preferred outcome, Biden warned of “swift and severe consequences” if Russia attacks. “We’re in agreement that it cannot be business as usual if Russia invades,” he said.
His repetition of several statements affirming their agreement offered perhaps the clearest signal of the lingering unease among allies, and the importance of conveying to Putin above all others that NATO’s two strongest powers remained committed.
“The bottom line is this: Germany and the U.S. are close friends and reliable partners and we can count on one another,” Biden said. He stated that the two leaders are aligned on the importance of deterring Russian aggression and upholding “the long-standing democratic principles of the rules-based international order.”
Scholz, a former finance minister under Angela Merkel, brought little international security experience to the chancellorship when he succeeded her in December. On his first visit to Washington as chancellor, he also worked to allay concerns that Germany, a pillar of the transatlantic alliance in recent years, was suddenly a weak link.
Germany’s leadership was criticized last month by allies and Germans for sending only a shipment of 5,000 helmets as its main contribution to Ukraine’s defense.
Politics
President Biden will host Germany’s new leader Monday at the White House, an opportunity for the two pillars of the transatlantic alliance to reaffirm their strong commitment to NATO and Ukraine. For Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who seemed to waver in the face of pressure from Moscow and Beijing, it’s something of a do-over.

Germany’s ambassador to the United States sent a frantic memo back to Berlin last week advising Scholz that Washington was questioning its ally’s reliability and that many Republicans believe, she wrote, that the new chancellor is “in bed with Putin.”
“We’re in a very difficult situation,” Scholz told reporters, calling the Russian troop buildup “a serious threat to European security.... If there was a military aggression against Ukraine, this will entail severe consequences that we have worked on together.”
While eagerly conveying a shared commitment to the alliance and to Ukraine’s defense, Scholz and Biden worked during their Oval Office meeting to bridge real differences when it comes to Ukraine — specifically, Germany’s reluctance to contribute to the country’s military defense and the circumstances that would trigger economic sanctions.
Initially upon taking office, Scholz had seemed to waver on sanctioning the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, calling it a private project, but eventually shifted his stance in January and, aiming to quell widespread criticism, said that “all options” were on the table.
World & Nation
Fears are rising over what would happen to Europe’s energy supply if Russia were to invade Ukraine and then cut off its natural gas exports.

On Sunday evening, Scholz gave a lengthy interview to the Washington Post reiterating that stance and stating that NATO’s response to any Russian aggression would be “united and decisive” — a clear public relations push that offered another sign of his deliberateness in working to restore his credibility on this trip to Washington.
Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center, said Scholz’s unwillingness to explicitly verbalize Biden’s threat to scrap the pipeline project is hardly a sign of daylight between allies. “A little bit of strategic ambiguity is a smart play for him,” she said. “By putting the onus on the U.S. to say, ‘This won’t go forward,’ it takes pressure off him.”
Constanze Stelzenmuller, an expert on Germany at the Brookings Institution, agreed that Scholz’s  commitment to strong financial sanctions sends a stronger message than his careful dancing around the pipeline. “Those sanctions will be really costly for Germany,” she said.
Biden’s meeting with Scholz occurred just as French President Emmanuel Macron sat down for talks with Putin at the Kremlin in another diplomatic foray aimed at deterring Moscow from going forward with an invasion. U.S. intelligence officials have predicted that Russian forces will swiftly overtake Ukraine’s military in an assault that will almost certainly result in high civilian casualties.
Biden, during the news conference, said he thought “it would be wise [for American citizens in Ukraine] to leave the country.”
NATO allies have thus far been unable to convince Putin that invading Ukraine is not worth the pain of the resulting economic sanctions.
They have stated that those sanctions would be far more consequential than what allies imposed in 2014 after Putin’s annexation of Crimea.
Putin has continued to seek guarantees from NATO that it will never admit Ukraine into the long-standing alliance that, under Article V of its charter, considers an attack against one member nation an attack against all.
Ironically, the U.S. and other member states are deeply reluctant to admit Ukraine and thus guarantee its military defense. So far, they have also refused to say that to Putin, stating instead that it’s a decision all member nations could consider down the road and refusing to promise that Ukraine would never be admitted."

She added that a month of hard work would be needed to get a new government in place.
Germany’s persistently high jobless rate helped bring down outgoing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s center-left coalition in last month’s parliamentary elections.
Merkel told Der Spiegel in an interview that “unemployment must fall in this parliamentary term.”"
https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-07-fg-rice7-story.html;2005-12-07;Individual Rights Must Be Upheld, Merkel Says - Los Angeles Times;"As new questions arose in Europe over U.S. treatment of suspected militants, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday that those combating terrorism must “find a balance” that does not violate individual rights and international law.
The chancellor’s comments came as Rice began a European trip engulfed by criticism of the U.S. over reports that CIA planes used airports on the continent as stopovers while transporting prisoners to secret interrogation sites, some reportedly operated in Eastern Europe.
The matter has been particularly sensitive in Berlin, coming amid accusations that U.S. intelligence operatives mistakenly abducted a German national of Lebanese descent in December 2003 and held him for five months. Rice would not directly comment on the detention of Khaled Masri, but she said during a news conference with Merkel that “any policy will sometimes result in errors, and when it does we will do everything we can to rectify them.”
Masri filed a lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in northern Virginia against former CIA Director George J. Tenet. The suit, which also names the owners of the plane that allegedly transported Masri, charges that the 42-year-old car salesman was subjected to “torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.”
Standing together in the chancellery, Merkel and Rice sought to strengthen German-American relations that were damaged by former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s fervent opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Merkel stressed the transatlantic partnership and the cooperation of intelligence services. But facing pressure from leftists in her fragile coalition government, the new chancellor said international law must be respected in dealing with alleged terrorists.
“We have to fight the challenges of the 21st century,” said Merkel, referring to terrorism. “We, at the same time, have to see to it that we seek the right means ... that allow us to stay in line with the legal system and the laws in which we believe.”
Intelligence agencies need latitude to do their jobs, she said. But she added, “I think the essential is that we have to adhere to the rules in each case.”
Echoing statements she made Monday, Rice said the U.S. follows international law and “does not condone torture.” She added that any debate on the arrests and interrogations of terrorism suspects “must have a healthy respect for the challenges we face when we face an enemy that operates from within our societies and that is intent” on killing civilians.

Rice cited bombings in recent years in Madrid, London and Jordan, saying: “When you face that kind of threat you have an obligation to do everything you can and get to the perpetrators” before they act.
The comments by Merkel and Rice underscored the sensitivities between Europe and Washington. The continent is suspicious of the U.S. policy known as “extraordinary renditions,” in which suspects are abducted in one country and flown to another nation for interrogation. Some European lawmakers complain that Washington has violated international treaties and national sovereignties by allowing CIA planes, possibly carrying prisoners, to fly in Europe’s airspace and stop over at U.S. military bases on the continent.
“I consider it a scandal that the Americans are discrediting the Western system of values,” said Volker Beck, a Green Party member of Parliament. “I think we have to reach an agreement with our American friends” that Germany is not indirectly involved in torturing suspects by allowing U.S. planes to use its airspace. He suggested that if such assurances could not be given, Germany should forbid flyovers by CIA aircraft.
The German government reported this week that more than 430 such CIA flights had occurred over Germany or made stops at U.S. bases in the country, including Ramstein Air Base. The European Union is investigating whether flights occurred in other countries. Details on the flights are emerging amid other reports that Poland and Romania housed secret U.S. facilities for interrogations.
Warsaw and Bucharest have denied the allegations, which were first raised by Human Rights Watch. They add an intriguing dynamic to the transatlantic relationship and to the east-west divide within Europe. Former Soviet bloc nations -- such as Poland, which sent 1,500 troops to Iraq -- generally have been more pro-American than their western counterparts. This has caused a diplomatic split in Europe and marks a change in U.S. strategic interests as American military bases shift out of countries such as Germany and to Poland and Romania.
The Polish government has confirmed that a plane possibly chartered by the CIA landed in September 2003 at the former military airport at SzczytnoSzymany in northeastern Poland. The airport is near a training site for Polish intelligence officers. The plane landed with seven people onboard and took on five more passengers holding U.S. passports before departing less than an hour later.
Romania has been more circumspect about CIA flights and alleged detention centers. Unlike Poland, Romania is not yet a member of the European Union, and fears its chances for entry might be jeopardized if it were linked to CIA activities.
However, Romania is not shy about its admiration for Washington. Rice arrived in Bucharest on Tuesday evening for talks with President Traian Basescu and signed a deal allowing the U.S. military to use Romanian bases, Reuters news service reported. Basescu said one U.S. base would be located at the Mihail Kogalniceanu airfield near the Black Sea, which Human Rights Watch has said may have been used as a secret CIA jail.
The mood was more sober between Merkel and Rice in Berlin over the U.S. role in the Masri case. Parliament is investigating the alleged abduction and detention of Masri, who German authorities say was mistaken for an Al Qaeda lieutenant while traveling in Macedonia. German prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation.
Masri told The Times this year that he was flown from Macedonia to Afghanistan and held at a U.S.-run detention center and interrogated for months. He was released and dropped in the Albanian mountains without a passport or money, he said.
The case has also led to questions in Germany over how much the Schroeder government knew about CIA flights and Masri’s detention.
“I am asking the American government to admit its mistakes and to apologize for my treatment,” said Masri in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union. “I am hoping that an American court will say very clearly that what happened to me was illegal and cannot be done to others.”
After meeting with Rice, Merkel said she was grateful the Bush administration has “admitted this man had been erroneously taken.” She added, “I am happy that [Rice] has repeated here that when such mistakes happen, they must be corrected immediately.”
But as Rice left Berlin for Bucharest, a senior U.S. official traveling with the secretary told Reuters that Rice had not acknowledged mistakes in the Masri case. The official said of Merkel, “We are not quite sure what was in her head.”
The official added that Masri was released after the U.S. realized “that it no longer had evidence or intelligence to justify his continued detention.”

CDU candidate Andreas Laemmel won the contest for a Dresden seat with 37% of the vote. He defeated Marlies Volkmer of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s Social Democratic Party, who drew 32%.
Voters elsewhere in Germany voted for parliament Sept. 18, giving Merkel’s conservative alliance about 35% and Schroeder’s party 34%.
The Dresden election was postponed because of the death of a candidate.
Sunday’s result brings to 226 the number of seats held by Merkel’s party and its allied Christian Social Union in the 614-member lower house. Schroeder’s party has 222, with the remainder of the seats held by smaller parties.
Merkel’s conservatives have been exploring the possibility of forming an alliance with the Social Democrats, but talks have been stalled because both Merkel and Schroeder claim mandates to be chancellor."
https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-oct-11-fg-merkel11-story.html;2005-10-11;Merkel to Make German History as Chancellor - Los Angeles Times;"Germany will soon swear in its first female chancellor after two leading political parties agreed Monday to form a coalition government around Angela Merkel, a conservative physicist raised in the former communist east.
Following weeks of public bickering and quiet negotiating, the deal crystallized when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced he would step aside and allow his Social Democratic Party to share power with Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union.
The deal was orchestrated by leaders of both parties but must be approved by their wider memberships. The parties are expected to agree, but Merkel’s appointment will probably be delayed until next month.
Germany has been in political disarray since a Sept. 18 election gave neither party a clear majority. Schroeder initially refused to concede, but the pressures of a troubled economy and an agitated public forced him to accept compromise. Schroeder and Merkel spent recent nights negotiating Cabinet posts and finessing an agreement that hard-liners in their parties could accept.
“We have achieved something big,” Merkel said at a news conference after a morning negotiating session that assured her the chancellery. “We have set our aim to create a coalition that stands for new policies. We want to work together for the people of this country.”
When asked how she felt about the seemingly certain prospect of becoming chancellor, a tired-looking Merkel smiled and responded: “I’m doing well. I’m in a good mood, but I have a lot of work ahead of me.”
The presumed chancellor did not elaborate on foreign policy, but indicated she would strengthen relations with the U.S., which have been strained by German opposition to the Iraq war.
“That doesn’t mean we have to agree on every issue,” Merkel said, referring to Washington. “But there needs to be a good, trustful relationship.”

Merkel’s remarkable ascension through Germany’s male-dominated politics means Schroeder’s seven years in office are nearing an end. An affable leader with a fondness for cigars and crisp suits, Schroeder began reforming his nation’s vast welfare state but failed to reduce high unemployment and bolster the economy. He may be best remembered for challenging President Bush on Iraq and urging Germany to move beyond the stigma of its Nazi past to become a world player.
Schroeder had no immediate statement on his future, but it appeared he would not have a role in the new government.
“I have a different plan for my life,” he reportedly told a German newspaper.
Merkel, a skilled political pragmatist who prefers back-room maneuverings to campaign trail politics, lacks Schroeder’s flair and media savvy.
Her near-bungling of the election, including announcing a flat-tax proposal days before the vote, has raised questions about her ability to lead a country of 82 million. But her intellectual rigor helped her quickly regain her composure and quiet party dissenters. A recent poll suggests that more voters would pick her over Schroeder as chancellor in a coalition.
Merkel’s rise has been extraordinary. A married scientist with no children, she was not active in communist opposition groups in the former East Germany. Her political career began in earnest in 1990 after then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl singled her out for her discipline and organizational abilities. She became a skilled strategist, outflanking other CDU officials to lead the party in 2000.
“This new start and new coalition offer us new opportunities,” Merkel said Monday. “We are obligated to achieve success. We must succeed.”
The political deadlock in what was nicknamed the “chancellor war” emerged three weeks ago when Merkel, a reticent political tactician, squandered a 20-point lead in the polls to finish 1 percentage point ahead of the Social Democrats. It was an embarrassing setback for the conservative CDU. But that party, including some officials who had wanted to replace Merkel, ultimately rallied around the 51-year-old daughter of a Lutheran minister.
Schroeder’s charisma and adamant tone after the election gave Social Democrats leverage in negotiating Cabinet posts. Under the agreement, Merkel was forced into major concessions, giving the SPD eight ministries, including foreign, justice, and labor and social affairs. Her party will control the chancellery, six ministries and an additional Cabinet post.
Merkel said this equal division within the Cabinet meant it would not be possible “for one to overrule the others.”
The coalition is called “grand,” but it is expected to be fragile. The closeness of the election underscored German apprehension over social and economic reforms necessary to reduce 11.6% unemployment and rejuvenate Europe’s largest economy. Schroeder called for moderate reforms and cuts to the generous welfare state. Merkel has proposed harsher measures, but Schroeder’s rise in the polls before the election indicates the CDU may have to temper its plan.
“It will be a big art of governing for Merkel to again and again find majorities for her reform programs,” said Peter Loesche, a political analyst. “In grand coalitions, there is always opposition from within.”
The fear is that a coalition of center-leftists and conservatives will drift into gridlock as one side attempts to block the proposals of the other in redefining a social democracy Germans have trusted since the end of World War II. In recent years, German unions have been weakened and wages have fallen as the nation has struggled to remain competitive amid globalization.
The battle lines between the CDU and SPD became apparent hours after the coalition agreement. Franz Muentefering, leader of the Social Democrats, said the coalition was “the right decision for the country,” but he suggested that his party would oppose severe cuts to social and labor entitlements.
“There are certain taboos,” Muentefering said.

California attorney general to investigate Torrance police
California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said his office would investigate the Torrance Police Department after a scandal that revealed more than a dozen police officers had exchanged racist text messages for years, joked about using violence against suspects and mocked the idea that internal affairs might catch them.
The announcement came hours after The Times published an investigation revealing that more than a dozen Torrance police officers had exchanged racist and antisemitic texts and images recently uncovered as part of a criminal investigation into two former officers. (Bonta’s review had been in the works before The Times article was published.)
Fifteen officers are on administrative leave, according to a Torrance police spokesman. The officers identified by The Times were involved in at least seven serious or fatal uses of force against Black or Latino men since 2013.

Young Latinos are dying of COVID at an alarming rate
In California, younger Latinos are dying of COVID-19 at much higher rates than their white and Asian counterparts. Younger Black people also are dying at high rates, but the disparity is starkest for Latinos.

As more people get vaccinated, pandemic restrictions lift and the economy rebounds, the families of the young Latinos who died will feel the loss for decades to come — not just the grief but also the long-term financial hardships.
It will be harder for their children to get an education and achieve upward mobility, potentially widening the class divide in the coming decades.
In our sister newsletter the Latinx Files publishing later this morning, Fidel Martinez looks at this article and others in a package of stories by colleague Alejandra Reyes-Velarde on the enormous toll that the pandemic has taken on the community.
L.A. Unified employees lose their jobs over vaccine requirement
Nearly 500 Los Angeles school district employees have lost their jobs for failing to meet the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, officials announced. The number represents less than 1% of about 73,000 employees, a compliance rate the school system characterizes as a success.
The total of terminated employees is much smaller than feared. Seven of the dismissed employees held teaching credentials, although officials did not indicate whether they were classroom teachers. An unknown number of workers remain in limbo while their requests for exemptions continue to be evaluated.

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-nov-03-la-fg-obama-merkel4-2009nov04-story.html;2009-11-03;Obama and German Chancellor Merkel meet to discuss climate change, Afghanistan - Los Angeles Times;"German Chancellor Angela Merkel, fresh from being sworn in for her second term, met with President Obama at the White House this morning to discuss global warming and Afghanistan before she heads to Congress where she will be the first German leader to address a joint session.
“I am thrilled to have Chancellor Merkel here today,” Obama said this morning. “I want to congratulate her again for her victory in her recent election, the formation of a government.”
Merkel visit comes as American voters head to the polls to decide a handful of important off-year elections. Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in governors’ races in Virginia and New Jersey and in an upstate New York congressional district. Polls show that Democrats are trailing in two races and locked in a tight race in New Jersey.
“Chancellor Merkel has been an extraordinary leader on the issue of climate change,” Obama said this morning. “And the United States, Germany, and countries around the world, I think, are all beginning to recognize why it is so important that we work in common in order to stem the potential catastrophe that could result if we continue to see global warming continuing unabated.”
But Obama has had problems with the issue in Congress, which is focused on healthcare reform. A Senate committee today met to start discussion of a bill, sponsored by Democrats Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, but most Republicans boycotted the session. The bill would place a cap on greenhouse gas production in the U.S. and would create a market for companies to buy and sell pollution credits.
The cap-and-trade legislation is not expected until next year.
In her speech to Congress, Merkel said she would thank the American people for their help reunify East and West Germany after the Cold war ended.
“I wanted to use this opportunity today also to express our gratitude, my gratitude, to the American people for the support that the American people have given us throughout the process leading up to German reunification, and I think it’s something that I would like to later on say it very clearly also in my speech to both houses of Congress,” Merkel said this morning.
“And let me tell you that this is something that we, the Germans, shall never forget.”

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-sep-28-fg-germany-elections28-story.html;2009-09-28;German Chancellor Angela Merkel wins second term, initial election results show - Los Angeles Times;"Chancellor Angela Merkel won a decisive second term Sunday in elections that are likely to shunt Germany’s government to the right.
Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union took 33.8% of the vote in a contest that was almost unanimously criticized by commentators as dull and uninspiring.
As an added plus for Merkel, the small libertarian Free Democrats came in third with 14.6%, official results showed. That will allow her to rule in coalition with the pro-business party and pursue an agenda of lower taxes and labor reform.
Together, the two parties won 332 seats in the lower house of Parliament, compared with other parties’ combined 290.
The vote ends the awkward government of the last four years, which yoked the Christian Democrats, or CDU, with their archrivals, the left-of-center Social Democrats, in a “grand coalition.”
For the Social Democrats, Sunday was a humiliating defeat that saw the party plunge to its worst performance since World War II: 23%. The rout will almost certainly propel them out of coalition government for the first time in 11 years.
It was a “bitter day,” the Social Democrats’ leader, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, acknowledged to supporters after the polls closed and the results began streaming in. But he promised that the party would remain a political force pressing for fairer distribution of wealth and protection of workers.
“I promise you that we will be an opposition that will look very closely at what happens, how this new team will react,” said Steinmeier, who has been Germany’s foreign minister in the coalition government. “It has to prove that it knows what it’s doing.”

As a candidate, Steinmeier was seen as a bland bureaucrat unable to fire the public imagination. By contrast, although Merkel was lambasted by political watchers for running a soporific campaign almost devoid of substantive debate, she held on to her high personal-approval ratings to win reelection as Germany’s first female leader.
“We have achieved something great,” she told cheering party members in a victory speech Sunday evening. “We have managed to achieve our election aim of a stable majority in Germany for a new government.”
She said she would initiate talks with the Free Democrats about forming a center-right coalition. Such a pairing would enable Merkel, 55, to tackle the contentious issue of labor-market reform in Germany, where companies complain about stringent worker protections that they say drag down business and competitiveness.
With the Free Democrats in her corner, Merkel also is likely to try to halt the planned phase-out of nuclear power, another highly emotional issue in Germany, where the Green Party and many ordinary people oppose such plants.
And crucially for the U.S., a new center-right coalition will probably be steelier in its continued commitment of troops to the war in Afghanistan, a deeply unpopular undertaking in Germany.
President Obama called Merkel to congratulate her and said he “looks forward to continued close cooperation,” the Associated Press reported.
Following usual practice, the Free Democrats’ leader, Guido Westerwelle, as the junior coalition partner, will probably be named foreign minister. He would be the first openly gay person to hold the post.
“We are happy with this extraordinary result, but we know above all that this means we have responsibility now,” Westerwelle said to his cheering supporters. “We are ready to carry this responsibility. We want to co-govern Germany because we have to make sure that there is a tax system that is fairer.”
Though widely predicted by the opinion polls, Merkel’s reelection was not an unmitigated victory. Critics will ask why, despite her immense popularity, she was unable to lead the CDU to a larger share of the vote than in 2005, when the party drew 35%.
Political commentators ascribed some of that to the lackluster campaign, which offered just one debate between Merkel and Steinmeier. Most pundits judged that Steinmeier won that faceoff.
But the Christian Democrats’ inability to improve on their last outing at the polls, and the Social Democrats’ steep dive, also reflects the steady splintering of Germany’s political scene. The two big parties used to count on 80% of the vote between them, but in recent years, smaller groups such as the Greens, the Free Democrats and the Left Party have grown in influence.
Sunday’s election also was beset by increasing voter apathy and disillusionment, especially among residents in the east, in areas bypassed by the rising prosperity of the last few years.
Though high by American standards, at more than 70%, voter turnout was the lowest in Germany in more than 60 years, according to polling agency Gallup Europe.

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-03-fg-g20-tabloids3-story.html;2009-04-03;At G-20 summit, British tabloids take their shots at Sarkozy and Merkel - Los Angeles Times;"If there’s one thing that British tabloids disdain more than the French, it’s the Germans.
So when the leaders of France and Germany banded together this week to offer their kinder, gentler alternative to Anglo-American capitalism, lips smacked audibly here at the prospect of 2-for-1 night at the Euro-bash buffet.
They may have refrained from the open name-calling of years past, but the tabloids took aim nonetheless at French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“What a pair of sourpusses,” said the Daily Express in an editorial Thursday on the two leaders’ joint news conference outlining their expectations of the Group of 20 economic summit. Sarkozy and Merkel promised to “speak with one voice” at the meeting, and most of what they said together Wednesday threw cold water on President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s call for bigger fiscal stimulus packages.
“Seldom has such a sour performance been put on by visiting dignitaries,” the Express said. “Instead of uniting with other world leaders, they poured out their bile toward the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ economic model. They dream of making Paris, Frankfurt and Brussels the world’s predominant financial centers.”
Of course, pouring out bile is an activity that Britain’s notorious tabloid press is well acquainted with. None of them makes any pretense of unbiased reporting, but their combined readership is in the millions, outstripping that of the “respectable papers.”
For the Daily Mail, Sarkozy and Merkel’s joint appearance at a posh London hotel was “provocative” and represented “an extraordinary attempt to hijack” Thursday’s summit.
Never mind that the two lead the biggest economies of all the countries that use the euro for currency, or that their call for greater regulation of global finance is one that resonates with countless Europeans as well as others who find capitalism’s recent excesses abhorrent.

Sarkozy and Merkel, the Mail accused, were intent on feeding the “bureaucracy junkies” in Brussels, where the European Union has its headquarters. And Merkel, the paper declared, might “live to rue the day” she refused to fatten Germany’s fiscal stimulus package.
To be fair, besides nasty foreigners, the tabloids also enjoy dissing Brown, who is faring poorly in the polls. This time, they sniped at the low wattage of Brown’s star power next to Obama’s.
Readers of the Daily Star who managed to thumb past the photo of a well-endowed topless model on Page 3 were treated to a description of how Britain’s “crawling prime minister tried to capitalize on his counterpart’s popularity in the desperate hope that some of his gloss would rub off on him.”
An accompanying cartoon showed Brown unfurling an enormous tongue for Obama to walk on, with the American president declaring in surprise, “Normally they just roll out the red carpet!”

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-03-fg-merkel3-story.html;2005-12-03;Merkel to Steer Germany Back Toward U.S. - Los Angeles Times;"New German Chancellor Angela Merkel is moving quickly to improve relations with the United States that were damaged over the Iraq war and by Berlin’s increasingly independent and sometimes erratic voice in world affairs.
Merkel has been in office less than two weeks, but she has sent strong signals to Washington that she values transatlantic ties more than her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, did. She will not give President Bush what he wants most -- German troops in Iraq -- but Merkel is not inclined toward the Paris-Berlin-Moscow axis honed by Schroeder’s Social Democratic government.
“Let the battles of the past rest,” Merkel, a conservative, said of U.S.-German ties during her first speech to Parliament this week. “The battles are fought out. Our aim for the future is: With all our strength the new government will foster a close, truthful, open and trustful relationship within the transatlantic partnership.”
Raised in communist East Germany, Merkel appreciates the U.S. role in building democracy in this once-divided nation. But she is pragmatic and candid, quietly informing Washington that her government is agitated that CIA planes reportedly carrying terrorism suspects briefly stopped at U.S. bases in Germany. The matter is expected to be raised again Tuesday when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets Merkel in Berlin.
The chancellor’s demeanor and diplomatic nuance during a trip to Washington next month for talks with President Bush will be closely watched. Analysts say Merkel cannot appear too willing to appease. Such a perception could upset her fragile coalition government, if leftist Social Democrats accuse her of reversing Germany’s adamant stance of opposing U.S. policies on Iraq and the treatment of prisoners.
“Merkel understands Bush is in huge trouble,” said Jan-Friedrich Kallmorgen, an analyst with the German Council on Foreign Relations. “But she can’t be seen as conceding. She will not send soldiers to Iraq, but she may offer to continue German training of Iraq security forces here and in the United Arab Emirates. This will give the Americans at least some relief on the Iraq front.”
Eckart von Klaeden, foreign policy spokesman for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said: “In the short term there will not be a great substantive change in German policy toward the U.S. But the mood and the atmosphere will change, and those are just as important to foreign policy.”
Merkel’s most pressing concerns are reducing 11% unemployment and trimming costly social programs in Europe’s largest economy. Some analysts and opposition politicians have suggested that foreign policy concerns would be overshadowed by the chancellor’s domestic agenda and efforts to hold together an often acrimonious coalition of leftists and conservatives.

But over the last week Merkel has appeared confident jetting around the continent, traveling to Paris, London and Warsaw and meeting with NATO and European leaders in Brussels. She faced her first international crisis by refusing to give in to the demands of militants who kidnapped a German archeologist in Iraq on Monday.
“For a long time the Germans believed that nothing would happen to them if they did not deploy troops to Iraq. The kidnapping of Susanne Osthoff proves the contrary,” the newspaper Die Welt wrote. “The new government is being put to the test. Even [the terrorist] knows that a change of government has taken place in Berlin.”
A physicist known for her political pragmatism, Merkel responded swiftly to the kidnapping but did not allow it to overshadow her global views.
Her intent is to play an influential role in relations between Washington and a post-Cold War European Union that is integrating and expanding eastward. Merkel stressed these themes in her speech to Parliament, choosing to cite the U.S. and new EU member Poland without mentioning German-French relations. Such a scenario would strengthen America’s interests, especially in former Soviet bloc nations that have been more supportive of U.S. policy than have Western European capitals.
“The Americans are hoping for a return to traditional German foreign policy in which Berlin acts as a link between the U.S. and Europe,” an editorial in Handelsblatt newspaper said. “The question arises, however, of what foreign political weight Bush can credibly bring to bear. His poll ratings are low, his reform projects on ice, and it looks like he will be forced to make a retreat from Iraq. Because he is so weakened, he needs partners like Merkel. That is a chance for Germany to gain more attention in Washington.”
A similar transatlantic role was played by Merkel’s onetime mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who presided over German unification in 1990. In such a role, Merkel will have to confront Moscow’s anti-democratic sentiments and its concerns about a growing EU. Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin had an openly warm relationship that many German politicians complained prevented the then-chancellor from criticizing Moscow’s policies, including human rights abuses in Chechnya.
“There will be a personal relationship between Merkel and Putin, but it will be on a more subdued level,” Kallmorgen said. “She speaks Russian and she clearly understands the strategic importance of Russia to Europe. It’s key on energy and business matters. But I would assume she will be tougher on rule of law and democracy issues than Schroeder was.”
Candor also will be directed toward the Bush administration. In comments after his meeting with Rice this week, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Parliament that Germany’s relations with the United States should be characterized this way: “We want to be good partners and, if necessary, critical and constructive partners.”"
