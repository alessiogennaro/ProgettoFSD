When Vladimir Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian state, he is speaking the familiar language of empire. For five hundred years, European conquerors called the societies that they encountered “tribes,” treating them as incapable of governing themselves. As we see in the ruins of Ukrainian cities, and in the Russian practice of mass killing, rape, and deportation, the claim that a nation does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.Empire’s story divides subjects from objects. As the philosopher Frantz Fanon argued, colonizers see themselves as actors with purpose, and the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn when returning to the Presidency a decade ago. In 2012, he described Russia as a “state-civilization,” which by its nature absorbed smaller cultures such as Ukraine’s. The next year, he claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were joined in “spiritual unity.” In a long essay on “historical unity,” published last July, he argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single country, bound by a shared origin. His vision is of a broken world that must be restored through violence. Russia becomes itself only by annihilating Ukraine.
As the objects of this rhetoric, and of the war of destruction that it sanctions, Ukrainians grasp all of this. Ukraine does have a history, of course, and Ukrainians do constitute a nation. But empire enforces objectification on the periphery and amnesia at the center. Thus modern Russian imperialism includes memory laws that forbid serious discussion of the Soviet past. It is illegal for Russians to apply the word “war” to the invasion of Ukraine. It is also illegal to say that Stalin began the Second World War as Hitler’s ally, and used much the same justification to attack Poland as Putin is using to attack Ukraine. When the invasion began, in February, Russian publishers were ordered to purge mentions of Ukraine from textbooks.
Faced with the Kremlin’s official mixture of fantasy and taboo, the temptation is to prove the opposite: that it is Ukraine rather than Russia that is eternal, that it is Ukrainians, not Russians, who are always right, and so on. Yet Ukrainian history gives us something more interesting than a mere counter-narrative to empire. We can find Ukrainian national feeling at a very early date. In contemporary Ukraine, though, the nation is not so much anti-colonial, a rejection of a particular imperial power, as post-colonial, the creation of something new.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
The city of Kyiv did not exist in ancient times, but it is very old—about half a millennium older than Moscow. It was probably founded in the sixth or seventh century, north of any territory seen by Greeks or controlled by Romans. Islam was advancing, and Christianity was becoming European. The Western Roman Empire had fallen, leaving a form of Christianity subordinate to a pope. The Eastern (Byzantine) Empire remained, directing what we now call the Orthodox Church. As Rome and Constantinople competed for converts, peoples east of Kyiv converted to Islam. Kyivans spoke a Slavic language that had no writing system, and practiced a paganism without idols or temples.
Putin’s vision of “unity” relates to a baptism that took place in this setting. In the ninth century, a group of Vikings known as the Rus arrived in Kyiv. Seeking a southbound route for their slave trade, they found the Dnipro River, which runs through the city. Their chieftains then fought over a patchwork of territories in what is now Ukraine, Belarus, and the northeast of Russia—with Kyiv always as the prize. In the late tenth century, a Viking named Valdemar took the city, with the help of a Scandinavian army. He initially governed as a pagan. But, around 987, when the Byzantines faced an internal revolt, he sensed an opportunity. He came to the emperor’s aid, and received his sister’s hand in marriage. In the process, Valdemar converted to Christianity.
Putin claims that this messy sequence of events reveals the will of God to bind Russia and Ukraine forever. The will of God is easy to misunderstand; in any case, modern nations did not exist at the time, and the words “Russia” and “Ukraine” had no meaning. Valdemar was typical of the pagan Eastern European rulers of his day, considering multiple monotheistic options before choosing the one that made the most strategic sense. The word “Rus” no longer meant Viking slavers but a Christian polity. Its ruling family now intermarried with others, and the local people were treated as subjects to be taxed rather than as bodies to be sold.
Yet no rule defined who would take power after a Kyivan ruler’s death. Valdemar took a Byzantine princess as his wife, but he had a half a dozen others, not to mention a harem of hundreds of women. When he died in 1015, he had imprisoned one of his sons, Sviatopolk, and was making war upon another, Yaroslav. Sviatopolk was freed after his father’s death, and killed three of his brothers, but he was defeated on the battlefield by Yaroslav. Other sons entered the fray, and Yaroslav didn’t rule alone until 1036. The succession had taken twenty-one years. At least ten other sons of Valdemar had died in the meantime.
These events do not reveal a timeless empire, as Putin claims. But they do suggest the importance of a succession principle, a theme very important in Ukrainian-Russian relations today. The Ukrainian transliteration of “Valdemar” is “Volodymyr,” the name of Ukraine’s President. In Ukraine, power is transferred through democratic elections: when Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 Presidential election, the sitting President accepted defeat. The Russian transliteration of the same name is “Vladimir.” Russia is brittle: it has no succession principle, and it’s unclear what will happen when Vladimir Putin dies or is forced from power. The pressure of mortality confirms the imperial thinking. An aging tyrant, obsessed by his legacy, seizes upon a lofty illusion that seems to confer immortality: the “unity” of Russia and Ukraine.

In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
This was a crucial change. After 1569, Kyiv was no longer a source of law but an object of it—the archetypal colonial situation. It was colonization that set off Ukraine from the former territories of Rus, and its manner generated qualities still visible today: suspicion of the central state, organization in crisis, and the notion of freedom as self-expression, despite a powerful neighbor.
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, all the forces of Europe’s globalization seemed to bear down on Ukraine. Polish colonization resembled and in some measure enabled the European colonization of the wider world. Polish nobles introduced land-management practices—along with land managers, most of whom were Jewish—that allowed the establishment of profitable plantations. Local Ukrainian warlords rushed to imitate the system, and adopted elements of Polish culture, including Western Christianity and the Polish language. In an age of discovery, enserfed peasants labored for a world market.
Ukraine’s colonization coincided with the Renaissance, and with a spectacular flowering of Polish culture. Like other Renaissance thinkers, Polish scholars in Ukraine resuscitated ancient knowledge, and sometimes overturned it. It was a Pole, Copernicus, who undid the legacy of Ptolemy’s “Almagest” and confirmed that the Earth orbits the sun. It was another Pole, Maciej of Miechów, who corrected Ptolemy’s “Geography,” clearing Ukrainian maps of gold and ambrosia. As in ancient times, however, the tilling of the black earth enabled tremendous wealth, raising the question of why those who labored and those who profited experienced such different fates.
The Renaissance considered questions of identity through language. Across Europe, there was a debate as to whether Latin, now revived, was sufficient for the culture, or whether vernacular spoken languages should be elevated for the task. In the early fourteenth century, Dante answered this question in favor of Italian; English, French, Spanish, and Polish writers created other literary languages by codifying local vernaculars. In Ukraine, literary Polish emerged victorious over the Ukrainian vernacular, becoming the language of the commercial and intellectual élite. In a way, this was typical: Polish was a modern language, like English or Italian. But it was not the local language in Ukraine. Ukraine’s answer to the language question was deeply colonial, whereas in the rest of Europe it could be seen as broadly democratic.
The Reformation brought a similar result: local élites converted to Protestantism and then to Roman Catholicism, alienating them further from an Orthodox population. The convergence of colonization, the Renaissance, and the Reformation was specific to Ukraine. By the sixteen-forties, the few large landholders generally spoke Polish and were Catholic, and those who worked for them spoke Ukrainian and were Orthodox. Globalization had generated differences and inequalities that pushed the people to rebellion.
Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
The rebellion began in 1648, when an influential Cossack, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, saw his lands seized and his son attacked by a Polish noble. Finding himself beyond the protection of the law, Khmelnytsky turned his fellow-Cossacks toward revolt against the Polish-speaking, Roman Catholic magnates who dominated Ukraine. The accumulated cultural, religious, and economic grievances of the people quickly transformed the revolt into something very much like an anti-colonial uprising, with violence directed not only against the private armies of the magnates but against Poles and Jews generally. The magnates carried out reprisals against peasants and Cossacks, impaling them on stakes. The Polish-Lithuanian cavalry fought what had been their own Cossack infantry. Each side knew the other very well.
In 1651, the Cossacks, realizing that they needed help, turned to an Eastern power, Muscovy, about which they knew little. When Kyivan Rus had collapsed, most of its lands had been absorbed by Lithuania, but some of its northeastern territories remained under the dominion of a Mongol successor state. There, in a new city called Moscow, leaders known as tsars had begun an extraordinary period of territorial expansion, extending their realm into northern Asia. In 1648, the year that the Cossack uprising began, a Muscovite explorer reached the Pacific Ocean.
The war in Ukraine allowed Muscovy to turn its attention to Europe. In 1654, the Cossacks signed an agreement with representatives of the tsar. The Muscovite armies invaded Poland-Lithuania from the east; soon after, Sweden invaded from the north, setting off the crisis that Polish history remembers as “the Deluge.” Peace was eventually made between Poland-Lithuania and Muscovy, in 1667, and Ukraine was divided more or less down the middle, along the Dnipro. After a thousand years of existence, Kyiv was politically connected to Moscow for the first time.
The Cossacks were something like an early national movement. The problem was that their struggle against one colonial power enabled another. In 1721, Muscovy was renamed the Russian Empire, in reference to old Rus. Poland-Lithuania never really recovered from the Deluge, and was partitioned out of existence between 1772 and 1795. Russia thereby claimed the rest of Ukraine—everything but a western district known as Galicia, which went to the Habsburgs. Around the same time, in 1775, the Cossacks lost their status. They did not gain the political rights they had wanted, nor did the peasants who supported them gain control of the black earth. Polish landowners remained in Ukraine, even as state power became Russian.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The nineteenth century was the age of national revivals. When the Ukrainian movement began in imperial Russian Kharkov—today Kharkiv, and largely in ruins—the focus was on the Cossack legacy. The next move was to locate history in the people, as an account of continuous culture. At first, such efforts did not seem threatening to imperial rule. But, after the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, in 1856, and the insult of the Polish uprising of 1863 and 1864, Ukrainian culture was declared not to exist. It was often deemed an invention of Polish élites—an idea that Putin endorsed in his essay on “historical unity.” Leading Ukrainian thinkers emigrated to Galicia, where they could speak freely.
The First World War brought the principle of self-determination, which promised a release from imperial rule. In practice, it was often used to rescue old empires, or to build new ones. A Ukrainian National Republic was established in 1917, as the Russian Empire collapsed into revolution. In 1918, in return for a promise of foodstuffs, the country was recognized by Austria and Germany. Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination, but his victorious entente ignored Ukraine, recognizing Polish claims instead. Vladimir Lenin invoked the principle as well, though he meant only that the exploitation of national questions could advance class revolution. Ukraine soon found itself at the center of the Russian civil war, in which the Red Army, led by the Bolsheviks, and the White Army, fighting for the defunct empire, both denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty. In this dreadful conflict, which followed four years of war, millions of people died, among them tens of thousands of Jews.
Though the Red Army ultimately prevailed, Bolshevik leaders knew that the Ukrainian question had to be addressed. Putin claims that the Bolsheviks created Ukraine, but the truth is close to the opposite. The Bolsheviks destroyed the Ukrainian National Republic. Aware that Ukrainian identity was real and widespread, they designed their new state to account for it. It was largely thanks to Ukraine that the Soviet Union took the form it did, as a federation of units with national names.
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
Stalin spoke of an internal colonization, in which peasants would be exploited so that the Soviet economy could imitate—and then overtake—capitalism. His policy of collective agriculture, in which land was seized from farmers, was particularly unwelcome in Ukraine, where the revolution had finally got rid of the (still largely Polish) landholders. Yet the black earth of Ukraine was central to Stalin’s plans, and he moved to subdue it. In 1932 and 1933, he enforced a series of policies that led to around four million people dying of hunger or related disease. Soviet propaganda blamed the Ukrainians, claiming that they were killing themselves to discredit Soviet rule—a tactic echoed, today, by Putin. Europeans who tried to organize famine relief were dismissed as Nazis.
The actual Nazis saw Stalin’s famine as a sign that Ukrainian agriculture could be exploited for another imperial project: their own. Hitler wanted Soviet power overthrown, Soviet cities depopulated, and the whole western part of the country colonized. His vision of Ukrainians was intensely colonial: he imagined that he could deport and starve them by the millions, and exploit the labor of whoever remained. It was Hitler’s desire for Ukrainian land that brought millions of Jews under German control. In this sense, colonial logic about Ukraine was a necessary condition for the Holocaust.
Between 1933 and 1945, Soviet and Nazi colonialism made Ukraine the most dangerous place in the world. More civilians were killed in Ukraine, in acts of atrocity, than anywhere else. That reckoning doesn’t even include soldiers: more Ukrainians died fighting the Germans, in the Second World War, than French, American, and British troops combined.
The major conflict of the war in Europe was the German-Soviet struggle for Ukraine, which took place between 1941 and 1945. But, when the war began, in 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany were de-facto allies, and jointly invaded Poland. At the time, what is now western Ukraine was southeastern Poland. A small group of Ukrainian nationalists there joined the Germans, understanding that they would seek to destroy the U.S.S.R. When it became clear that the Germans would fail, the nationalists left their service, ethnically cleansed Poles in 1943 and 1944, and then resisted the Soviets. In Putin’s texts, they figure as timeless villains, responsible for Ukrainian difference generally. The irony, of course, is that they emerged thanks to Stalin’s much grander collaboration with Hitler. They were crushed by Soviet power, in a brutal counter-insurgency, and today Ukraine’s far right polls at one to two per cent. Meanwhile, the Poles, whose ancestors were the chief victims of Ukrainian nationalism, have admitted nearly three million Ukrainian refugees, reminding us that there are other ways to handle history than stories of eternal victimhood.
After the war, western Ukraine was added to Soviet Ukraine, and the republic was placed under suspicion precisely because it had been under German occupation. New restrictions on Ukrainian culture were justified by a manufactured allocation of guilt. This circular logic—we punish you, therefore you must be guilty—informs Kremlin propaganda today. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has argued that Russia had to invade Ukraine because Ukraine might have started a war. Putin, who has said the same, is clearly drawing on Stalin’s rhetoric. We are to understand that the Soviet victory in the Second World War left Russians forever pure and Ukrainians eternally guilty. At the funerals of Russian soldiers, grieving parents are told that their sons were fighting Nazis.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.
Ukrainian national rhetoric is less coherent than Putin’s imperialism, and, therefore, more credible, and more human. Independence arrived in 1991, when the U.S.S.R was dissolved. Since then, the country’s politics have been marked by corruption and inequality, but also by a democratic spirit that has grown in tandem with national self-awareness. In 2004, an attempt to rig an election was defeated by a mass movement. In 2014, millions of Ukrainians protested a President who retreated from the E.U. The protesters were massacred, the President fled, and Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time. Again and again, Ukrainians have elected Presidents who seek reconciliation with Russia; again and again, this has failed. Zelensky is an extreme case: he ran on a platform of peace, only to be greeted with an invasion.
Ukraine is a post-colonial country, one that does not define itself against exploitation so much as accept, and sometimes even celebrate, the complications of emerging from it. Its people are bilingual, and its soldiers speak the language of the invader as well as their own. The war is fought in a decentralized way, dependent on the solidarity of local communities. These communities are diverse, but together they defend the notion of Ukraine as a political nation. There is something heartening in this. The model of the nation as a mini-empire, replicating inequalities on a smaller scale, and aiming for a homogeneity that is confused with identity, has worn itself out. If we are going to have democratic states in the twenty-first century, they will have to accept some of the complexity that is taken for granted in Ukraine.
The contrast between an aging empire and a new kind of nation is captured by Zelensky, whose simple presence makes Kremlin ideology seem senseless. Born in 1978, he is a child of the U.S.S.R., and speaks Russian with his family. A Jew, he reminds us that democracy can be multicultural. He does not so much answer Russian imperialism as exist alongside it, as though hailing from some wiser dimension. He does not need to mirror Putin; he just needs to show up. Every day, he affirms his nation by what he says and what he does.
Ukrainians assert their nation’s existence through simple acts of solidarity. They are not resisting Russia because of some absence or some difference, because they are not Russians or opposed to Russians. What is to be resisted is elemental: the threat of national extinction represented by Russian colonialism, a war of destruction expressly designed to resolve “the Ukrainian question.” Ukrainians know that there is not a question to be answered, only a life to be lived and, if need be, to be risked. They resist because they know who they are. In one of his very first videos after the invasion, when Russian propaganda claimed that he had fled Kyiv, Zelensky pointed the camera at himself and said, “The President is here.” That is it. Ukraine is here.When Vladimir Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian state, he is speaking the familiar language of empire. For five hundred years, European conquerors called the societies that they encountered “tribes,” treating them as incapable of governing themselves. As we see in the ruins of Ukrainian cities, and in the Russian practice of mass killing, rape, and deportation, the claim that a nation does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it.
Empire’s story divides subjects from objects. As the philosopher Frantz Fanon argued, colonizers see themselves as actors with purpose, and the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn when returning to the Presidency a decade ago. In 2012, he described Russia as a “state-civilization,” which by its nature absorbed smaller cultures such as Ukraine’s. The next year, he claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were joined in “spiritual unity.” In a long essay on “historical unity,” published last July, he argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single country, bound by a shared origin. His vision is of a broken world that must be restored through violence. Russia becomes itself only by annihilating Ukraine.
As the objects of this rhetoric, and of the war of destruction that it sanctions, Ukrainians grasp all of this. Ukraine does have a history, of course, and Ukrainians do constitute a nation. But empire enforces objectification on the periphery and amnesia at the center. Thus modern Russian imperialism includes memory laws that forbid serious discussion of the Soviet past. It is illegal for Russians to apply the word “war” to the invasion of Ukraine. It is also illegal to say that Stalin began the Second World War as Hitler’s ally, and used much the same justification to attack Poland as Putin is using to attack Ukraine. When the invasion began, in February, Russian publishers were ordered to purge mentions of Ukraine from textbooks.
Faced with the Kremlin’s official mixture of fantasy and taboo, the temptation is to prove the opposite: that it is Ukraine rather than Russia that is eternal, that it is Ukrainians, not Russians, who are always right, and so on. Yet Ukrainian history gives us something more interesting than a mere counter-narrative to empire. We can find Ukrainian national feeling at a very early date. In contemporary Ukraine, though, the nation is not so much anti-colonial, a rejection of a particular imperial power, as post-colonial, the creation of something new.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
The city of Kyiv did not exist in ancient times, but it is very old—about half a millennium older than Moscow. It was probably founded in the sixth or seventh century, north of any territory seen by Greeks or controlled by Romans. Islam was advancing, and Christianity was becoming European. The Western Roman Empire had fallen, leaving a form of Christianity subordinate to a pope. The Eastern (Byzantine) Empire remained, directing what we now call the Orthodox Church. As Rome and Constantinople competed for converts, peoples east of Kyiv converted to Islam. Kyivans spoke a Slavic language that had no writing system, and practiced a paganism without idols or temples.
Putin’s vision of “unity” relates to a baptism that took place in this setting. In the ninth century, a group of Vikings known as the Rus arrived in Kyiv. Seeking a southbound route for their slave trade, they found the Dnipro River, which runs through the city. Their chieftains then fought over a patchwork of territories in what is now Ukraine, Belarus, and the northeast of Russia—with Kyiv always as the prize. In the late tenth century, a Viking named Valdemar took the city, with the help of a Scandinavian army. He initially governed as a pagan. But, around 987, when the Byzantines faced an internal revolt, he sensed an opportunity. He came to the emperor’s aid, and received his sister’s hand in marriage. In the process, Valdemar converted to Christianity.
Putin claims that this messy sequence of events reveals the will of God to bind Russia and Ukraine forever. The will of God is easy to misunderstand; in any case, modern nations did not exist at the time, and the words “Russia” and “Ukraine” had no meaning. Valdemar was typical of the pagan Eastern European rulers of his day, considering multiple monotheistic options before choosing the one that made the most strategic sense. The word “Rus” no longer meant Viking slavers but a Christian polity. Its ruling family now intermarried with others, and the local people were treated as subjects to be taxed rather than as bodies to be sold.
Yet no rule defined who would take power after a Kyivan ruler’s death. Valdemar took a Byzantine princess as his wife, but he had a half a dozen others, not to mention a harem of hundreds of women. When he died in 1015, he had imprisoned one of his sons, Sviatopolk, and was making war upon another, Yaroslav. Sviatopolk was freed after his father’s death, and killed three of his brothers, but he was defeated on the battlefield by Yaroslav. Other sons entered the fray, and Yaroslav didn’t rule alone until 1036. The succession had taken twenty-one years. At least ten other sons of Valdemar had died in the meantime.
These events do not reveal a timeless empire, as Putin claims. But they do suggest the importance of a succession principle, a theme very important in Ukrainian-Russian relations today. The Ukrainian transliteration of “Valdemar” is “Volodymyr,” the name of Ukraine’s President. In Ukraine, power is transferred through democratic elections: when Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 Presidential election, the sitting President accepted defeat. The Russian transliteration of the same name is “Vladimir.” Russia is brittle: it has no succession principle, and it’s unclear what will happen when Vladimir Putin dies or is forced from power.

In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
This was a crucial change. After 1569, Kyiv was no longer a source of law but an object of it—the archetypal colonial situation. It was colonization that set off Ukraine from the former territories of Rus, and its manner generated qualities still visible today: suspicion of the central state, organization in crisis, and the notion of freedom as self-expression, despite a powerful neighbor.

In Ukraine, literary Polish emerged victorious over the Ukrainian vernacular, becoming the language of the commercial and intellectual élite. In a way, this was typical: Polish was a modern language, like English or Italian. But it was not the local language in Ukraine. Ukraine’s answer to the language question was deeply colonial, whereas in the rest of Europe it could be seen as broadly democratic.
The Reformation brought a similar result: local élites converted to Protestantism and then to Roman Catholicism, alienating them further from an Orthodox population. The convergence of colonization, the Renaissance, and the Reformation was specific to Ukraine. By the sixteen-forties, the few large landholders generally spoke Polish and were Catholic, and those who worked for them spoke Ukrainian and were Orthodox. Globalization had generated differences and inequalities that pushed the people to rebellion.
Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
The rebellion began in 1648, when an influential Cossack, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, saw his lands seized and his son attacked by a Polish noble. Finding himself beyond the protection of the law, Khmelnytsky turned his fellow-Cossacks toward revolt against the Polish-speaking, Roman Catholic magnates who dominated Ukraine. The accumulated cultural, religious, and economic grievances of the people quickly transformed the revolt into something very much like an anti-colonial uprising, with violence directed not only against the private armies of the magnates but against Poles and Jews generally. The magnates carried out reprisals against peasants and Cossacks, impaling them on stakes. The Polish-Lithuanian cavalry fought what had been their own Cossack infantry. Each side knew the other very well.
In 1651, the Cossacks, realizing that they needed help, turned to an Eastern power, Muscovy, about which they knew little. When Kyivan Rus had collapsed, most of its lands had been absorbed by Lithuania, but some of its northeastern territories remained under the dominion of a Mongol successor state. There, in a new city called Moscow, leaders known as tsars had begun an extraordinary period of territorial expansion, extending their realm into northern Asia. In 1648, the year that the Cossack uprising began, a Muscovite explorer reached the Pacific Ocean.
The war in Ukraine allowed Muscovy to turn its attention to Europe. In 1654, the Cossacks signed an agreement with representatives of the tsar. The Muscovite armies invaded Poland-Lithuania from the east; soon after, Sweden invaded from the north, setting off the crisis that Polish history remembers as “the Deluge.” Peace was eventually made between Poland-Lithuania and Muscovy, in 1667, and Ukraine was divided more or less down the middle, along the Dnipro. After a thousand years of existence, Kyiv was politically connected to Moscow for the first time.
The Cossacks were something like an early national movement. The problem was that their struggle against one colonial power enabled another. In 1721, Muscovy was renamed the Russian Empire, in reference to old Rus. Poland-Lithuania never really recovered from the Deluge, and was partitioned out of existence between 1772 and 1795. Russia thereby claimed the rest of Ukraine—everything but a western district known as Galicia, which went to the Habsburgs. Around the same time, in 1775, the Cossacks lost their status. They did not gain the political rights they had wanted, nor did the peasants who supported them gain control of the black earth. Polish landowners remained in Ukraine, even as state power became Russian.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The nineteenth century was the age of national revivals. When the Ukrainian movement began in imperial Russian Kharkov—today Kharkiv, and largely in ruins—the focus was on the Cossack legacy. The next move was to locate history in the people, as an account of continuous culture. At first, such efforts did not seem threatening to imperial rule. But, after the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, in 1856, and the insult of the Polish uprising of 1863 and 1864, Ukrainian culture was declared not to exist. It was often deemed an invention of Polish élites—an idea that Putin endorsed in his essay on “historical unity.” Leading Ukrainian thinkers emigrated to Galicia, where they could speak freely.
The First World War brought the principle of self-determination, which promised a release from imperial rule. In practice, it was often used to rescue old empires, or to build new ones. A Ukrainian National Republic was established in 1917, as the Russian Empire collapsed into revolution. In 1918, in return for a promise of foodstuffs, the country was recognized by Austria and Germany. Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination, but his victorious entente ignored Ukraine, recognizing Polish claims instead. Vladimir Lenin invoked the principle as well, though he meant only that the exploitation of national questions could advance class revolution. Ukraine soon found itself at the center of the Russian civil war, in which the Red Army, led by the Bolsheviks, and the White Army, fighting for the defunct empire, both denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty. In this dreadful conflict, which followed four years of war, millions of people died, among them tens of thousands of Jews.
Though the Red Army ultimately prevailed, Bolshevik leaders knew that the Ukrainian question had to be addressed. Putin claims that the Bolsheviks created Ukraine, but the truth is close to the opposite. The Bolsheviks destroyed the Ukrainian National Republic. Aware that Ukrainian identity was real and widespread, they designed their new state to account for it. It was largely thanks to Ukraine that the Soviet Union took the form it did, as a federation of units with national names.
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
Stalin spoke of an internal colonization, in which peasants would be exploited so that the Soviet economy could imitate—and then overtake—capitalism. His policy of collective agriculture, in which land was seized from farmers, was particularly unwelcome in Ukraine, where the revolution had finally got rid of the (still largely Polish) landholders. Yet the black earth of Ukraine was central to Stalin’s plans, and he moved to subdue it. In 1932 and 1933, he enforced a series of policies that led to around four million people dying of hunger or related disease. Soviet propaganda blamed the Ukrainians, claiming that they were killing themselves to discredit Soviet rule—a tactic echoed, today, by Putin. Europeans who tried to organize famine relief were dismissed as Nazis.
The actual Nazis saw Stalin’s famine as a sign that Ukrainian agriculture could be exploited for another imperial project: their own. Hitler wanted Soviet power overthrown, Soviet cities depopulated, and the whole western part of the country colonized. His vision of Ukrainians was intensely colonial: he imagined that he could deport and starve them by the millions, and exploit the labor of whoever remained. It was Hitler’s desire for Ukrainian land that brought millions of Jews under German control. In this sense, colonial logic about Ukraine was a necessary condition for the Holocaust.
Between 1933 and 1945, Soviet and Nazi colonialism made Ukraine the most dangerous place in the world. More civilians were killed in Ukraine, in acts of atrocity, than anywhere else. That reckoning doesn’t even include soldiers: more Ukrainians died fighting the Germans, in the Second World War, than French, American, and British troops combined.
The major conflict of the war in Europe was the German-Soviet struggle for Ukraine, which took place between 1941 and 1945. But, when the war began, in 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany were de-facto allies, and jointly invaded Poland. At the time, what is now western Ukraine was southeastern Poland. A small group of Ukrainian nationalists there joined the Germans, understanding that they would seek to destroy the U.S.S.R. When it became clear that the Germans would fail, the nationalists left their service, ethnically cleansed Poles in 1943 and 1944, and then resisted the Soviets. In Putin’s texts, they figure as timeless villains, responsible for Ukrainian difference generally. The irony, of course, is that they emerged thanks to Stalin’s much grander collaboration with Hitler. They were crushed by Soviet power, in a brutal counter-insurgency, and today Ukraine’s far right polls at one to two per cent. Meanwhile, the Poles, whose ancestors were the chief victims of Ukrainian nationalism, have admitted nearly three million Ukrainian refugees, reminding us that there are other ways to handle history than stories of eternal victimhood.
After the war, western Ukraine was added to Soviet Ukraine, and the republic was placed under suspicion precisely because it had been under German occupation. New restrictions on Ukrainian culture were justified by a manufactured allocation of guilt. This circular logic—we punish you, therefore you must be guilty—informs Kremlin propaganda today. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has argued that Russia had to invade Ukraine because Ukraine might have started a war. Putin, who has said the same, is clearly drawing on Stalin’s rhetoric. We are to understand that the Soviet victory in the Second World War left Russians forever pure and Ukrainians eternally guilty. At the funerals of Russian soldiers, grieving parents are told that their sons were fighting Nazis.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.
Ukrainian national rhetoric is less coherent than Putin’s imperialism, and, therefore, more credible, and more human. Independence arrived in 1991, when the U.S.S.R was dissolved. Since then, the country’s politics have been marked by corruption and inequality, but also by a democratic spirit that has grown in tandem with national self-awareness. In 2004, an attempt to rig an election was defeated by a mass movement. In 2014, millions of Ukrainians protested a President who retreated from the E.U. The protesters were massacred, the President fled, and Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time. Again and again, Ukrainians have elected Presidents who seek reconciliation with Russia; again and again, this has failed. Zelensky is an extreme case: he ran on a platform of peace, only to be greeted with an invasion.
Ukraine is a post-colonial country, one that does not define itself against exploitation so much as accept, and sometimes even celebrate, the complications of emerging from it. Its people are bilingual, and its soldiers speak the language of the invader as well as their own. The war is fought in a decentralized way, dependent on the solidarity of local communities. These communities are diverse, but together they defend the notion of Ukraine as a political nation. There is something heartening in this. The model of the nation as a mini-empire, replicating inequalities on a smaller scale, and aiming for a homogeneity that is confused with identity, has worn itself out. If we are going to have democratic states in the twenty-first century, they will have to accept some of the complexity that is taken for granted in Ukraine.
The contrast between an aging empire and a new kind of nation is captured by Zelensky, whose simple presence makes Kremlin ideology seem senseless. Born in 1978, he is a child of the U.S.S.R., and speaks Russian with his family. A Jew, he reminds us that democracy can be multicultural. He does not so much answer Russian imperialism as exist alongside it, as though hailing from some wiser dimension. He does not need to mirror Putin; he just needs to show up. Every day, he affirms his nation by what he says and what he does.
Ukrainians assert their nation’s existence through simple acts of solidarity. They are not resisting Russia because of some absence or some difference, because they are not Russians or opposed to Russians. What is to be resisted is elemental: the threat of national extinction represented by Russian colonialism, a war of destruction expressly designed to resolve “the Ukrainian question.” Ukrainians know that there is not a question to be answered, only a life to be lived and, if need be, to be risked. They resist because they know who they are. In one of his very first videos after the invasion, when Russian propaganda claimed that he had fled Kyiv, Zelensky pointed the camera at himself and said, “The President is here.” That is it. Ukraine is here."

Over the weekend, a story came out of Brussels that many may have missed. The twenty-seven member states of the European Union reached an agreement on a new law requiring big online platforms, including social-media companies, to police hate speech and disinformation more effectively. Under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, European governments now have the power to ask Web platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove any content that promotes terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse, or commercial scams. The platforms will also be obliged to prevent the “manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security.”“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.
Ironically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.
Evidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.

In a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets  and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could  clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.
But none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?
Based on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”
Based on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month.  If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.
Musk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting  misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.
In a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.
Regulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”
Musk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.Over the weekend, a story came out of Brussels that many may have missed.

https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/werner-herzog-has-never-liked-introspection;2022-04-26;Werner Herzog Has Never Liked Introspection;"A conversation with the filmmaker about the place of literature, the toll of war, and the conviction that his writing will outlast his movies.
When I first corresponded with the filmmaker Werner Herzog, in January, 2021, he told me that lockdown reminded him of Boccaccio’s Decameron. As he put it: “Go into isolation in the countryside and let the storytelling begin.” During quarantine, he finished two films: a documentary called “The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft,” about a pair of French volcanologists; and another, “Theater of Thought,” about neurotechnology and artificial intelligence. Both are forthcoming.He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue.When I first corresponded with the filmmaker Werner Herzog, in January, 2021, he told me that lockdown reminded him of Boccaccio’s Decameron. As he put it: “Go into isolation in the countryside and let the storytelling begin.” During quarantine, he finished two films: a documentary called “The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft,” about a pair of French volcanologists; and another, “Theater of Thought,” about neurotechnology and artificial intelligence. Both are forthcoming.
He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue."

A new program lets civilians step up to help.
On the morning of August 15th, Halima, a twenty-two-year-old engineering student at the Afghan National Defense University, was sitting in her dorm room and studying for a final exam when she heard some girls screaming in the hallway. Taliban fighters had just arrived in Kabul, after the withdrawal of American troops, and were taking over the city. Halima, who is quiet, with delicate features, had grown up in a rural village in southern Afghanistan, where her father taught science at a girls’ school. Like many other young women who joined the Afghan military, she was Hazara, an ethnic and religious minority that has long been persecuted in Afghanistan, including by the Taliban.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option. Terrie Shannon, a seventy-eight-year-old retired education professor, agreed to lead the circle. “I said yes partly in defiance of the people in this county who supported Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants,” she told me. None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
The women weren’t allowed to work until their paperwork was sorted out, so they spent their days padding around the retreat center in slippers crocheted by the sisters. The women began calling Shannon “Grandmother.” One afternoon, Halima invited her over to speak with her mother on FaceTime, and both older women started to cry. “I swore a sacred promise to her that I would take care of her daughter,” Shannon told me. The young women were polite and quick to smile, but any mention of life at home made them grow grim. They worried about the women they had left behind. “We want so badly for them to find a way out, too,” Akbari said. They wanted to send the pocket money they received from the Sponsor Circle—fifteen dollars a week—home to their relatives, some of whom were near starvation owing to an ongoing famine. But the volunteers worried that too much financial support would muddy the scope of their commitment to the women. Frantz, who had adopted a son from Guatemala and had experience with the complexity of distant entanglements, said, “We could set up a dependency we really can’t sustain.” In the end, though, the volunteers helped Haidari wire money home to her father, who was sick.
Frustrations mounted. For Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari, life as a high-ranking student or professional was over. “We really don’t fit in here yet, and we don’t know the language,” Akbari said. The women had been given donated computers that were nearly useless. They needed to apply for public assistance, but the system was byzantine. They had entered the country on “humanitarian parole,” which, unlike refugee status, did not guarantee that, among other things, they could stay indefinitely, and meant that they still needed to apply for asylum. But many private immigration lawyers were overwhelmed and increasingly expensive. “They are charging exorbitant rates to the most vulnerable people,” Frantz said.
Still, the women found fun where they could. They went clothes shopping, and, after months of washing their hair with dish soap in the safe houses, they each chose their own shampoo. They went to a potluck dinner at the only mosque in northeastern Minnesota. They baked bread and sang songs with the sisters. They played volleyball in the driveway and tried out snowshoeing. One weekend, members of the Sponsor Circle offered to take the four women on a church snow-tubing trip. The night before, however, when a volunteer read them the waivers that they’d need to sign, the women decided not to go. Why, after risking their lives to escape Afghanistan, would they volunteer to do something that might break their legs? “We thought it must be something very dangerous,” Khalili told me.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”
One of the most critical factors in the successful integration of immigrants is their ability to find a community, and Sponsor Circles help to create local bonds. “It’s proven to make a difference in whether or not refugees succeed,” David Miliband, the president and C.E.O. of the International Rescue Committee, told me. Maniatis, from the Open Society Foundations, told me that he hopes that involving Americans directly in resettlement efforts will help to combat anti-immigrant sentiment: “This is infrastructure that engages a community in social issues and places people at the center of the solution.” Following the success of the Sponsor Circle program, the Biden Administration has decided to launch a larger sponsorship program, which will be implemented later this year. The Administration recently committed to welcoming a hundred thousand refugees from Ukraine, and some of them will be resettled through the new sponsorship program. “The Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans has shown that everyday Americans and community groups across the country are willing and able to step up in extraordinary ways,” a State Department spokesperson told me. “The experience to date demonstrates the powerful and impactful role that Americans from all walks of life can play as they seek to welcome Afghans and now Ukrainians arriving in their communities.”
But Sponsor Circles also face challenges. The program requires that volunteers raise at least two thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars per newcomer, and pledge to help out for a minimum of three months. “It’s nowhere near enough,” Embry Howell, a health-policy expert and a member of a Sponsor Circle in the D.C. area, told me. Sponsor Circles also lack the experience of government agencies, including knowledge about how to access social workers and how to navigate the labyrinthine systems that govern Social Security and other benefits. Howell told me that one woman she works with experiences severe anxiety when using the elevator in their building—which makes it difficult for her to leave the house. “She doesn’t speak English, all of her family is in Afghanistan, and mental health is really the missing piece.”
In Duluth, Halima and the others soon found work in the kitchen of an assisted-living and health-care center associated with the Benedictine sisters. The jobs paid only thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents an hour, but they came with a signing bonus of five hundred dollars. “As soon as I get that, I’m sending the money home,” Halima told me. Within three weeks, the Sponsor Circle had found them a place to live, at a house that was formerly a rental property, and sent over a team of volunteer builders to renovate it. The night before they moved in, the Sponsor Circle held a last pizza party at the retreat center. (Some of the volunteers were surprised to find that the women, cosmopolitan Kabulis, had had pizza many times before.) The room was warm and cozy. Shannon had sewn the girls cloth bags as presents, and drew numbers to determine a fair order in which each could pick a bag. “We’re just thrilled that you chose Duluth,” Shannon said. Halima replied, “We are really happy that you are friendly people.”
It was eight degrees below zero the next morning, as the women packed the last of their duffels and drove several miles to their new home. All four set to work making their beds, unpacking newly acquired knickknacks, including Christmas ornaments, pieces of costumes, and a sparkly magic wand that Halima had collected at a church rummage sale. Akbari hung the Christmas ornaments from a light pull in her room. Halima unpacked her sketches. Flipping through them, she stopped at the faces of women she’d left behind in the safe house. “They’ve moved now,” she told me. “We text with them on Facebook, and every time they text with us asking our sponsors to help them.” She pulled out one painting she’d done at Fort Dix, a portrait of her father, and propped it on her bedside table, behind her magic wand.On the morning of August 15th, Halima, a twenty-two-year-old engineering student at the Afghan National Defense University, was sitting in her dorm room and studying for a final exam when she heard some girls screaming in the hallway. Taliban fighters had just arrived in Kabul, after the withdrawal of American troops, and were taking over the city. Halima, who is quiet, with delicate features, had grown up in a rural village in southern Afghanistan, where her father taught science at a girls’ school. Like many other young women who joined the Afghan military, she was Hazara, an ethnic and religious minority that has long been persecuted in Afghanistan, including by the Taliban.
Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option.

None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.

In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, in 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, pronounced that “the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared.” Moscow and Washington had veered “from confrontation to interaction and, in some important cases, partnership,” he said. The Soviet Union’s collapse—which birthed fifteen new states, including Ukraine—transformed the world. In the new Europe, Gorbachev added, every country believed that it had become “fully sovereign and independent.” Historians imagined that the end of the Cold War would lead to the demise of the nuclear age, amid new diplomacy and arms-control treaties. The ingrained fears—that kilotons of destructive energy and toxic radiation could decimate a city and incinerate tens of thousands of human beings—began to dissipate. Beyond policy wonks, the word “nuclear” largely dropped from the public lexicon.Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has jolted the world back into an uncomfortable consciousness of the nuclear threat. In the past month, official warnings have emerged at a striking pace. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former ambassador to Russia, warned on April 14th. The U.S. assessment of when and why Moscow might use such weaponry has changed, Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, conceded in testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee. A prolonged war in Ukraine will sap Russia’s manpower and matériel, while sanctions will throw the nation into an economic depression and undermine its ability to produce more precision-guided munitions and conventional arms, he said. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.” Putin’s aggression is “reviving fears” of a more “militaristic Russia.”In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, in 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, pronounced that “the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared.” Moscow and Washington had veered “from confrontation to interaction and, in some important cases, partnership,” he said.

In New Orleans last week to give a speech, I planned to otherwise amuse myself with food and music. It was only while trying to get a weather forecast on my phone that I discovered the Crescent City (for reasons having to do with the location of a factory that made landing craft that proved critical for the D Day invasion) is also home to the National World War II Museum, which TripAdvisor ranked as the city’s best place to visit. Indeed, it’s listed as the seventh-best tourist attraction in the United States, and, since I had been to the rest of the top ten (well, not the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which, for reasons having to do with Universal Studios, is in Orlando, Florida), I figured why not. And a tribute to the museum curator’s art it is: moving, informative, and (even as it celebrates the heroism of that era) sensitive to the ways that America has changed in the postwar decades. Right now, as Earth Day dawns on a planet where the temperature in the Antarctic just rose seventy degrees above normal, and where, two days ago, Vladimir Putin tested his new intercontinental ballistic missile, that history seems particularly poignant.In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars.In New Orleans last week to give a speech, I planned to otherwise amuse myself with food and music.

Right now, as Earth Day dawns on a planet where the temperature in the Antarctic just rose seventy degrees above normal, and where, two days ago, Vladimir Putin tested his new intercontinental ballistic missile, that history seems particularly poignant.
In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars."

In the early spring of 2017, before France’s previous Presidential election, I took a taxi from my apartment in Paris to Saint-Cloud, a wealthy suburb to the west of the city. I remember the feeling of dread as the car crossed the Seine, the quaint church set into a hillside overlooking the urban sprawl below. I was a twenty-eight-year-old reporter, and Jewish, about to visit the home of Jean-Marie Le Pen, one of the country’s most notorious Holocaust deniers and far-right agitators.Jean-Marie’s daughter, Marine, was running in the French Presidential election for the second time that year, and I was there to profile him for the Washington Post. On April 24th, she will again face off against Emmanuel Macron, in the final round of the vote. The two sparred in a lengthy debate on April 20th, during which Macron hammered Marine for her admiration of Vladimir Putin and reliance on a Russian bank, and she attacked him for ignoring the plight of ordinary citizens. The far right has not been this close to power in France since 1944. Marine has styled herself as a candidate of almost grandmotherly compassion, focussing on the rising cost of living and posing for photos with her cats. Although she is likely to lose, she has already won the battle for legitimacy: polls project her winning forty-four per cent of the vote, which would be her highest share in any of her three Presidential campaigns. She is increasingly popular with working-class and lower-middle-class voters, who say that she has listened to their economic concerns while Macron, preoccupied by the war in Ukraine, has barely bothered to campaign.In the early spring of 2017, before France’s previous Presidential election, I took a taxi from my apartment in Paris to Saint-Cloud, a wealthy suburb to the west of the city.

This week, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, announced the onset of what he called a new phase in his country’s war on Ukraine, which appears to consist of a focus on Ukraine’s east and a more gradual speed of attack than that of the failed strikes of late February and early March. Lavrov cast this tactical shift as a natural outgrowth of Russia’s so-called special military operation, but it has only highlighted the country’s previous miscalculations. To better understand what went wrong with the Russian approach, I called Joel Rayburn, a retired Army colonel and former U.S. special envoy for Syria, who is now a fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington, D.C. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what Rayburn learned about the Russian military from his involvement in Syria policy, the biggest mistakes the Russians have made in Ukraine, and whether the failures stem from poor decision-making or corruption.Do you have an overarching theory for why the Russian military has seemingly underperformed in Ukraine?This week, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, announced the onset of what he called a new phase in his country’s war on Ukraine, which appears to consist of a focus on Ukraine’s east and a more gradual speed of attack than that of the failed strikes of late February and early March.

In the eight weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, the war there has been interpreted in terms that are familiar from previous wars—terms that often seem to be in contradiction with one another. It is a proxy war, and it is a fight for national self-determination. It is a reprise of the Cold War, and a reset of Yalta. It is an inevitable consequence of NATO expansion, and an unprovoked act of aggression by an autocrat bent on reclaiming a “greater” Russian unity that he thinks was taken by Western forces of globalization and political integration. All those ways of seeing the war are apt, but another familiar interpretation is pertinent, too. This is the view of Ukraine as a religious hot spot, where competing claims to a holy city, Kyiv, can be traced back hundreds of years, and where religious commitments and rivalries are deeply enmeshed in the society.Since March 6th, when Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow and primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave an incendiary homily likening Russia’s invasion to a culture war against the West, plenty of questions have been asked about his role and his motives. Is he a tool of Vladimir Putin or Putin’s spiritual adviser? Is his vision of “Russky Mir” (“Russian World”) the basis for Putin’s war or just a rhetorical glaze applied to it? How can a religious leader with any integrity support so brutal a war, and might another leader—Pope Francis, with whom Kirill entered into dialogue in 2016—persuade him to withdraw his support and urge Putin to stand down?In the eight weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, the war there has been interpreted in terms that are familiar from previous wars—terms that often seem to be in contradiction with one another.

Twenty-nine hours into the citywide search for the man who shot ten people on an express train in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, the N.Y.P.D. Crime Stoppers hotline received a tip, called in from a McDonald’s in the East Village. The tipster was the suspect himself, Frank Robert James, who then ambled off. Photos of James, who is sixty-two, had been circulating widely. They showed a heavyset Black man with a shaved or bald head, and dark circles beneath his eyes. At around 1:40 p.m. on Wednesday, N.Y.P.D. patrol officers from the Ninth Precinct found James at the corner of St. Mark’s Place and First Avenue, and put him in handcuffs. At a quickly assembled press conference, Mayor Eric Adams beamed in from Gracie Mansion, where he is in COVID-19 isolation, and said, “My fellow New Yorkers, we got him.”A voluminous history of YouTube videos, dating back years, had surfaced in relation to the case. A man fitting James’s description, calling himself the Prophet of Truth and the Prophet of Doom, appeared in many dozens of videotaped monologues that he posted online. His diatribes involved 9/11 conspiracies, the war in Ukraine, “the matrix,” and dark forces that he believed would use atomic weapons to “streamline, reshape, resize” the world: “The United States will be ruined, just like Egypt, Greece, and all the rest of that shit.” He declared that humankind should be “wiped the fuck out.” In early March, he posted a thirty-one-minute video titled “AND NOW I AM BECOME DEATH,” a quote attributed to Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who expressed regret for his role in creating the atomic bomb.Twenty-nine hours into the citywide search for the man who shot ten people on an express train in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, the N.Y.P.D.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Vladimir Putin downplayed the impact of the economic sanctions that the United States and European countries have imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine. While acknowledging that these measures—which include restrictions on Russian banks, the freezing of much of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves, and bans on imports of some Russian goods—have “achieved certain results,” Putin confidently insisted that the Russian economy “will adapt to the new environment.” As an example, he pointed out that Russia’s central bank has been able to cut interest rates in recent days. “That blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,” he declared.To be sure, there was bluster in Putin’s statements. The sanctions have certainly hit Russia’s economy: last weekend, the World Bank estimated that Russian G.D.P. would decline by about eleven per cent this year, noting that the country was already in “a deep recession.” But most of the sanctions still don’t apply to oil and gas, Russia’s primary exports, which are critical to the country’s trade balance and financial stability. Indeed, with the price of oil and gas having risen sharply since the war began, Russia is now earning more money on every barrel of oil and cubic foot of gas that it sells. These revenues, which often get paid in dollars and euros, are offsetting the decline in other Russian exports, providing the Kremlin with new foreign-exchange reserves, and helping to restore a degree of confidence in its banking system, which was tottering after the initial wave of sanctions.At a press conference on Tuesday, Vladimir Putin downplayed the impact of the economic sanctions that the United States and European countries have imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

Macron captured nearly twenty-eight per cent of the vote; Le Pen managed to win twenty-three per cent. They were followed by the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who won a surprising twenty-two per cent, and the television personality and writer Éric Zemmour, who ran to Le Pen’s right and briefly rose in the polls before finishing at seven per cent. Perhaps the most shocking results were the drubbings given to the mainstream center-right and center-left parties, which won 4.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent of the vote, respectively. The race was marked by increasingly dire rhetoric about crime, Islam, and immigration. Multiple candidates or their advisers warned of a “great replacement,” referring to a racist conspiracy theory that France is being strategically overrun by nonwhite immigrants.

His opponent was Jorden van Foreest, the twenty-sixth best player in the world and an adviser to the world’s best, Magnus Carlsen. “Jorden’s being, like, uber, uber solid,” Nakamura said a few moves in, scrunching his face. “It’s kind of annoying.” He traded his knight for a bishop, exchanged knight for knight, and launched his queen into van Foreest’s position. “A draw is just not good enough,” he said. “I can’t do it, though.” Then he had an idea. “I’m gonna try to win this. It probably doesn’t work, but I’m gonna try.” With twenty seconds left, Nakamura unleashed an all-out attack, sacrificing his queen and sending forth two rooks and a bishop, coercing van Foreest’s king into a dismal retreat. “Yeah, I’m winning,” Nakamura said, with a wry smile on his face. “Chess is a tough game. . . .

It might have been particularly audible in the New York Harbor, around the Statue of Liberty, that great gift of one republic to another, and where the smaller, original model of republican virtue was displayed just this past year.The good news was that, in the first round of the French Presidential election, on Sunday, while Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremist, anti-republican National Rally, once again advanced to the forthcoming second round, it was with a minimal increase to her tally from five years ago, and significantly if narrowly behind that of the incumbent President, the liberal republican Emmanuel Macron. Nothing is settled, but, though a Le Pen victory in the second round, on April 24th, is not out of the question, it seems at the moment improbable. Adding the votes that went to center and left candidates in this round to Macron’s tally, and adding the votes that went to the even more extreme-right candidates to Le Pen’s, it seems unlikely—not out of the question, but unlikely—that she will be able to cross the fifty-per-cent threshold. Macron should have a small but decisive edge, especially because the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who could never bring himself to actually support Macron, repeatedly asked his voters during his concession speech never to vote for Le Pen. Certainly, not all of his followers will go to Macron, but abhorrence of the extreme right is still a stronger motive for the French left than is abhorrence of the liberal center, strong though that motive is, as well. Non-French pundits see Mélenchon as a “kingmaker,” but this misreads French tradition, by which candidates are expected to declare their second-round allegiance immediately after the first round, and minimal bargaining for support goes on after that.A long sigh of at least partial relief was audible to anyone with an ear open to the wind blowing across the ocean from France last night.

On a recent afternoon, a nondescript S.U.V. parked in front of my hotel in Kyiv. Three men wearing Ukrainian military uniforms sat inside it. They motioned for me and Volodymyr Solohub, a local journalist and colleague, to get in the back seat. Moments later, we were speeding through Kyiv’s abandoned streets, exempted from a thirty-six-hour curfew imposed by the mayor in anticipation of increased Russian shelling. The boom of outgoing and incoming artillery fire bounced off the huge concrete Soviet-era apartment buildings around us, making it impossible to tell where it was coming from or where the strikes might land.Ivan Mishchenko, a forty-year-old father of three with a few gray hairs in his beard, drove the car. A suit hanger dangled from the back of his seat. Stoic and calm, he seemed like a fatherly figure to the two younger men in the car. Mishchenko is one of some two hundred Ukrainian Supreme Court judges, the rough equivalent of a federal judge in the United States. For the last month, he has served in a unit of civilian soldiers who use small, store-bought drones to try and locate Russian military positions. A fellow-member of the unit—the twenty-four-year-old anti-corruption activist Roman Ratushnyi—rode in the front passenger seat. The two men met in Mishchenko’s courtroom, when Ratushnyi was trying to stop developers from replacing a vast public park in Kyiv with high-rise apartment buildings. The third soldier in the car—a tall, bald, smiling twenty-eight-year-old—gave his name as “The Sergeant,” and told me that he was the only one who had been in the country’s military before the war.On a recent afternoon, a nondescript S.U.V. parked in front of my hotel in Kyiv.

The Ukrainian port city of Odesa sits atop a labyrinth of catacombs—technically, limestone quarries—which constitute perhaps the world’s largest network of urban tunnels, extending ten stories deep and tracing some fifteen hundred miles beneath the streets. Ever since the nineteenth century, as stonecutters mined the passages to build the city, locals have regarded these voids as a realm of mystery and peril. They have been a setting for both banditry—traffickers smuggled stolen goods through the quarries; fugitives dodged pursuers in the darkness—and heroism. During the Second World War, when the city was placed under siege by the Nazis, Soviet rebels used the tunnels as a secret headquarters. These days, a mysterious crack may open in the sidewalk, and Odesans will experience a sudden awareness of the hollows beneath their feet. But very few ever venture beneath the surface.Roman Mauser, a thirty-one-year-old electrical engineer from Odesa, began exploring the catacombs as a teen-ager, climbing down metal hatches in the street and spending hours wandering the passageways by headlamp.

Alongside a team of fellow-explorers, he opened a tour business where he guided people through the catacombs. On YouTube, he launched a channel on which he documented his expeditions.

For a month, Russian soldiers had taken up residence in the town’s Soviet-era house of culture, laying mattresses on the floors and positioning anti-aircraft missiles outside. During that time, they used the boiler room in the basement of an outbuilding to hold as many as twenty-two prisoners. Within the boiler room, there was a deeper chamber, a stone-walled crawl space the size of a refrigerator turned on its side.

By then, Novyi Bykiv had been occupied for several weeks. As Didyk and his grandfather passed a Russian checkpoint, soldiers told them that they had twenty minutes to return, and they had better hurry up.

There comes a point in most Administrations when an American President confronts his surprising powerlessness. Joe Biden, it seems, has reached that point. Just this week, Biden acknowledged that there was not much he could do, in the short term, to lower the skyrocketing prices of gasoline and food. “We can’t take immediate action that I’m aware of yet,” Biden said. After horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde and Tulsa, he emphasized a similar point: unless Congress passes new laws, he’s all too limited in what he can do on his own about the wave of gun massacres, no matter that the vast majority of Americans clamor for more gun-control measures. “I can’t dictate this stuff,” Biden told reporters, the other day. “I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t change a background check. I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.There comes a point in most Administrations when an American President confronts his surprising powerlessness.

I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
There is no doubt that Biden’s had a brutal second spring in office. The sense of metastasizing crisis threatens to overwhelm any other story about his leadership. Much of the problem, though, is out of his control. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the worst war in Europe in a generation, now looks to grind on for months or years, and trigger global food and energy crises. The Supreme Court, with its 6–3 conservative majority, is about to toss out the five-decade-old right to abortion. There’s the highest inflation in four decades, and fears of a recession to come. Then, of course, there’s the pandemic. As the author Chris Whipple joked to NBC the other day, “What’s next? Locusts?”
Biden’s running commentary in recent days about the limits of what he can do to combat these plagues could be seen as a bit of let-me-level-with-you candor. “Here’s the deal” has long been one of his favorite lines. But this frankness comes at a time when reviews of his approach to the Presidency have been increasingly withering. CNN used the phrase “reactive crouch” this week. NBC headlined its version “Inside a Biden White House Adrift.” In liberal Massachusetts, the Boston Globe recently found support for the President under fifty per cent—and Boston.com highlighted its coverage of the poll results with a comment from a voter: “He’s done next to nothing.” Biden admitting his inability to fix intractable problems might be honest, but it’s also a political problem in and of itself for a President whose leadership has increasingly come into question.
The accepted story of the modern American Presidency has been one of inexorably expanding executive power—an “imperial Presidency,” as the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., styled it— acquiring and exercising more and more authority at the expense of the other branches of government. Yet there is a countervailing narrative, too, especially in this era of political polarization, obstruction, and congressional gridlock, when passing laws requires a level of political consensus that does not exist in a system where actors are increasingly incentivized not to make deals but to brag about their refusal to compromise. On leaving the White House, in 2016, Barack Obama told the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that, despite the “unique” power vested in the Presidency, he had come to realize it also came with a “whole host of institutional constraints” that held him back from both doing and saying what he wanted.
Donald Trump, of course, had a different approach. Rather than lament the limitations of the office, he regularly asserted vast powers that he did not possess. Who could forget his claim that Article II of the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want as President”? He often falsely invoked his “total” authority when faced with obstacles, famously doing so during the initial stages of the pandemic, and then quickly backed away when confronted with the facts of what such an assertion in practice would mean. Some of his executive-power grabs were breathtaking—in 2018, the family-separation policy that resulted in thousands of children being forcibly taken from their parents at the border, until an outcry forced him to stop; in 2019, the defiance of Congress to raid the Pentagon’s budget in order to pay for his border wall, even though Congress had explicitly refused to appropriate the funds he had requested for it. Most often, Trump used bluster to obscure his own failure to deliver on grandiose promises that were never really within his power to accomplish.
Biden may have overcorrected. Which is why, I suspect, the President ended the week delivering an unusual prime-time address to the nation, from the White House’s Cross Hall, with flickering rows of candles behind him in honor of the victims of mass shootings. In his speech, Biden struck a very different note from his hey-what’s-a-President-to-do laments of earlier in the week. He talked of going to mourn with the families of the victims in Buffalo and Uvalde. He shared their message to him and to Washington: “Do something, just do something, for God’s sake.”
Rather than merely bemoaning the influence of the all-powerful gun lobby again, he offered a long list of specific legislation to be passed. He called for an assault-weapons ban and, if that is too politically difficult for Congress, pushed to raise the age at which a person can legally purchase such a weapon, from eighteen to twenty-one. He demanded new “red flag” laws that would allow family members or school officials to ask a judge to temporarily block an unstable person from possessing or buying firearms. He also advocated for a ban on high-capacity magazines, the passage of safe-storage requirements, and the repeal of gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.
Of course, it was still true at the end of his speech, just as it was at the beginning, that Joe Biden can’t dictate this stuff. He wasn’t wrong about that. Yet another crucial moment in his Presidency may once again come down to the decisions of one or two senators in closed-door talks in which Biden is not a participant. Congressional reporters quickly pointed out that many of the gun-control measures Biden proposed, such as renewing the assault-weapons ban and forbidding high-capacity magazines, aren’t even being discussed by a bipartisan group of ten senators who have renewed gun-control talks in the wake of Uvalde. But “Do Something” is a much better message for an American President than “I Can’t Make it Happen.” Especially when there’s a midterm election coming up in a few months.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.
Which means that Biden has a few weeks, at best, to somehow revive an approval rating that currently stands in Trumpian territory: an average of 40.8 per cent approval, 54 per cent disapproval, according to the political Web site FiveThirtyEight. It’s one reason, among many bad indicators for Democrats, that forecasters right now predict Republicans will take over the House this fall, and very likely the Senate as well. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report projects Democratic losses of twenty to thirty-five seats in the House, where Republicans need just a handful of wins to gain control.
And what will happen in June? The Supreme Court will likely decide to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats in the House will try and fail to pass Biden’s assault-weapons ban. There will be more fighting in Ukraine, and the very real possibility that, despite the influx of American weapons, Russia will continue to make territorial gains in the country’s east and inflict heavy casualties. Inflation shows little sign of receding; gas prices may reach record highs. This week, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, warned of an economic “hurricane” that could push oil from its current price of a hundred and nineteen dollars a barrel—which currently seems nightmarishly high—all the way up to a hundred and fifty dollars per barrel, or even a hundred and seventy-five. According to the American Automobile Association, gas prices at the pump, reportedly the metric that is obsessing Biden’s White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, are currently averaging $4.76 per gallon nationally—up from $3.04 a year ago. COVID-19 has not disappeared either, and new variants suggest the possibility of additional spikes this fall.
Not all of these events will necessarily boost Republicans. Some may even benefit Biden. Polls suggest that the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft abortion ruling caused a surge in support for abortion rights. A Gallup poll found support for abortion rights at its highest level since 1995; a Wall Street Journal survey found that fifty-seven per cent of Americans back a woman’s right to a legal abortion for any reason, the highest level since the question was first asked by the publication’s pollster, in 1977. If Roe is indeed thrown out, Democrats are hoping to generate a wave of anger-fuelled support this fall, especially among independent-leaning female voters, who were key to the Party’s success in retaking the House in the 2018 midterms and holding it in 2020.
June will also mark the opening of public hearings by the select committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, prime-time proceedings that Jamie Raskin, one of the panel’s Democratic members, has promised will “blow the roof off the House.” Evidence of Trump’s plot to illegally overturn the 2020 election results—and Republicans’ complicity beforehand and refusal to disavow it afterward—will, at a minimum, reinforce Biden’s message to Democratic voters that they must turn out to avoid handing more power to the “ultra MAGA” and “extreme” forces now controlling the G.O.P. (However, many Republicans, it should be noted, have already started appropriating Biden’s insult as a compliment. “I am ultra MAGA and I am proud of it,” Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, recently said.)
And, besides, reminding voters of Trump’s perfidy is not the same thing as resurrecting Biden’s political standing. If the President wants his supporters to turn out this fall, he needs to convince them, once again, of his leadership. Biden’s speech on Thursday night was not aimed at Republicans. It almost certainly will not miraculously produce an end to the congressional impasse over guns, which long pre-dates his Presidency. Yet, somehow, it still seemed important that he delivered the address. “Enough. Enough. Enough,” Biden said, on Thursday. He might not succeed. He probably won’t.

Just this week, Biden acknowledged that there was not much he could do, in the short term, to lower the skyrocketing prices of gasoline and food. “We can’t take immediate action that I’m aware of yet,” Biden said. After horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde and Tulsa, he emphasized a similar point: unless Congress passes new laws, he’s all too limited in what he can do on his own about the wave of gun massacres, no matter that the vast majority of Americans clamor for more gun-control measures. “I can’t dictate this stuff,” Biden told reporters, the other day. “I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t change a background check. I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
There is no doubt that Biden’s had a brutal second spring in office. The sense of metastasizing crisis threatens to overwhelm any other story about his leadership. Much of the problem, though, is out of his control. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the worst war in Europe in a generation, now looks to grind on for months or years, and trigger global food and energy crises. The Supreme Court, with its 6–3 conservative majority, is about to toss out the five-decade-old right to abortion. There’s the highest inflation in four decades, and fears of a recession to come. Then, of course, there’s the pandemic. As the author Chris Whipple joked to NBC the other day, “What’s next? Locusts?”
Biden’s running commentary in recent days about the limits of what he can do to combat these plagues could be seen as a bit of let-me-level-with-you candor. “Here’s the deal” has long been one of his favorite lines. But this frankness comes at a time when reviews of his approach to the Presidency have been increasingly withering. CNN used the phrase “reactive crouch” this week. NBC headlined its version “Inside a Biden White House Adrift.” In liberal Massachusetts, the Boston Globe recently found support for the President under fifty per cent—and Boston.com highlighted its coverage of the poll results with a comment from a voter: “He’s done next to nothing.” Biden admitting his inability to fix intractable problems might be honest, but it’s also a political problem in and of itself for a President whose leadership has increasingly come into question.
The accepted story of the modern American Presidency has been one of inexorably expanding executive power—an “imperial Presidency,” as the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., styled it— acquiring and exercising more and more authority at the expense of the other branches of government. Yet there is a countervailing narrative, too, especially in this era of political polarization, obstruction, and congressional gridlock, when passing laws requires a level of political consensus that does not exist in a system where actors are increasingly incentivized not to make deals but to brag about their refusal to compromise. On leaving the White House, in 2016, Barack Obama told the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that, despite the “unique” power vested in the Presidency, he had come to realize it also came with a “whole host of institutional constraints” that held him back from both doing and saying what he wanted.
Donald Trump, of course, had a different approach. Rather than lament the limitations of the office, he regularly asserted vast powers that he did not possess. Who could forget his claim that Article II of the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want as President”? He often falsely invoked his “total” authority when faced with obstacles, famously doing so during the initial stages of the pandemic, and then quickly backed away when confronted with the facts of what such an assertion in practice would mean. Some of his executive-power grabs were breathtaking—in 2018, the family-separation policy that resulted in thousands of children being forcibly taken from their parents at the border, until an outcry forced him to stop; in 2019, the defiance of Congress to raid the Pentagon’s budget in order to pay for his border wall, even though Congress had explicitly refused to appropriate the funds he had requested for it. Most often, Trump used bluster to obscure his own failure to deliver on grandiose promises that were never really within his power to accomplish.
Biden may have overcorrected. Which is why, I suspect, the President ended the week delivering an unusual prime-time address to the nation, from the White House’s Cross Hall, with flickering rows of candles behind him in honor of the victims of mass shootings. In his speech, Biden struck a very different note from his hey-what’s-a-President-to-do laments of earlier in the week. He talked of going to mourn with the families of the victims in Buffalo and Uvalde. He shared their message to him and to Washington: “Do something, just do something, for God’s sake.”
Rather than merely bemoaning the influence of the all-powerful gun lobby again, he offered a long list of specific legislation to be passed. He called for an assault-weapons ban and, if that is too politically difficult for Congress, pushed to raise the age at which a person can legally purchase such a weapon, from eighteen to twenty-one. He demanded new “red flag” laws that would allow family members or school officials to ask a judge to temporarily block an unstable person from possessing or buying firearms. He also advocated for a ban on high-capacity magazines, the passage of safe-storage requirements, and the repeal of gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.
Of course, it was still true at the end of his speech, just as it was at the beginning, that Joe Biden can’t dictate this stuff. He wasn’t wrong about that. Yet another crucial moment in his Presidency may once again come down to the decisions of one or two senators in closed-door talks in which Biden is not a participant. Congressional reporters quickly pointed out that many of the gun-control measures Biden proposed, such as renewing the assault-weapons ban and forbidding high-capacity magazines, aren’t even being discussed by a bipartisan group of ten senators who have renewed gun-control talks in the wake of Uvalde. But “Do Something” is a much better message for an American President than “I Can’t Make it Happen.” Especially when there’s a midterm election coming up in a few months.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.
Which means that Biden has a few weeks, at best, to somehow revive an approval rating that currently stands in Trumpian territory: an average of 40.8 per cent approval, 54 per cent disapproval, according to the political Web site FiveThirtyEight. It’s one reason, among many bad indicators for Democrats, that forecasters right now predict Republicans will take over the House this fall, and very likely the Senate as well. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report projects Democratic losses of twenty to thirty-five seats in the House, where Republicans need just a handful of wins to gain control.
And what will happen in June? The Supreme Court will likely decide to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats in the House will try and fail to pass Biden’s assault-weapons ban. There will be more fighting in Ukraine, and the very real possibility that, despite the influx of American weapons, Russia will continue to make territorial gains in the country’s east and inflict heavy casualties. Inflation shows little sign of receding; gas prices may reach record highs. This week, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, warned of an economic “hurricane” that could push oil from its current price of a hundred and nineteen dollars a barrel—which currently seems nightmarishly high—all the way up to a hundred and fifty dollars per barrel, or even a hundred and seventy-five. According to the American Automobile Association, gas prices at the pump, reportedly the metric that is obsessing Biden’s White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, are currently averaging $4.76 per gallon nationally—up from $3.04 a year ago. COVID-19 has not disappeared either, and new variants suggest the possibility of additional spikes this fall.
Not all of these events will necessarily boost Republicans. Some may even benefit Biden. Polls suggest that the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft abortion ruling caused a surge in support for abortion rights. A Gallup poll found support for abortion rights at its highest level since 1995; a Wall Street Journal survey found that fifty-seven per cent of Americans back a woman’s right to a legal abortion for any reason, the highest level since the question was first asked by the publication’s pollster, in 1977. If Roe is indeed thrown out, Democrats are hoping to generate a wave of anger-fuelled support this fall, especially among independent-leaning female voters, who were key to the Party’s success in retaking the House in the 2018 midterms and holding it in 2020.
June will also mark the opening of public hearings by the select committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, prime-time proceedings that Jamie Raskin, one of the panel’s Democratic members, has promised will “blow the roof off the House.” Evidence of Trump’s plot to illegally overturn the 2020 election results—and Republicans’ complicity beforehand and refusal to disavow it afterward—will, at a minimum, reinforce Biden’s message to Democratic voters that they must turn out to avoid handing more power to the “ultra MAGA” and “extreme” forces now controlling the G.O.P. (However, many Republicans, it should be noted, have already started appropriating Biden’s insult as a compliment. “I am ultra MAGA and I am proud of it,” Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, recently said.)
And, besides, reminding voters of Trump’s perfidy is not the same thing as resurrecting Biden’s political standing. If the President wants his supporters to turn out this fall, he needs to convince them, once again, of his leadership. Biden’s speech on Thursday night was not aimed at Republicans. It almost certainly will not miraculously produce an end to the congressional impasse over guns, which long pre-dates his Presidency. Yet, somehow, it still seemed important that he delivered the address. “Enough. Enough. Enough,” Biden said, on Thursday. He might not succeed. He probably won’t. But at least, it seems, he has decided that he’s not giving up either."

In the past two weeks, Joe Biden has attended a summit in Asia; flown to Texas to grieve with family members of the victims of the Uvalde gun massacre; met with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, to discuss the inflation challenge; and announced a new weapons package for Ukraine. The President can’t be accused of slacking, but he and his party badly need a domestic political win. Just conceivably, there could be one in the offing—a new spending deal on Capitol Hill—but, as ever, much depends on Joe Manchin, a.k.a. Senator Roadblock.On Tuesday, Manchin attended a meeting with the A.A.R.P. in West Virginia, then took to Twitter and called on his congressional colleagues to stand up for seniors and reduce the cost of prescription drugs. “By allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month, and allowing the importation of drugs from Canada, we can lower prescription drug prices in America,” Manchin wrote. “We must take action & keep the promises we’ve made to our seniors.”
Not surprisingly, Manchin’s tweet sparked the fury of fellow-Democrats, particularly progressive ones. “You literally killed the bill to do this,” Representative Ilhan Omar, a member of the Squad, quote-tweeted. Warren Gunnels, a staff director for Bernie Sanders, also weighed in, writing, “What a phony. THE reason we failed to keep our promises to seniors is because @Sen_JoeManchin sabotaged the Build Back Better Act & refuses to end the filibuster.”
The point that Omar and Gunnels made was incontrovertible. Last November, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, announced that his Democratic colleagues, including Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona, had agreed to include a prescription-drug package in the Build Back Better bill, which also featured tax hikes on the rich, tax credits for green energy, paid leave, and a range of other social programs. Under the prescription-drug plan, Medicare would have used its heft to negotiate lower prices for eligible medicines, price increases would have been limited for other drugs, and there would have been an annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients. Thanks to Manchin, the Senate never got to vote on Build Back Better. With the Democratic caucus needing all of its fifty votes to pass a bill through the reconciliation process, he went on Fox News days before Christmas and declared, “I can’t get there.”
It’s no wonder that so many Democrats remain angry at Manchin, but they are also aware that he still has a vote, which could make prescription-drug reform and other Democratic priorities a reality. Last week, Manchin met with Schumer about the possibility of forging a new reconciliation bill focussed on three elements: prescription-drug reform, green-energy incentives, and a reversal of the feed-the-rich Trump-G.O.P. tax cuts.
While such a package would fall well short of the grand Democratic ambitions of 2021, each of its elements would represent a significant policy achievement—and together they would give Democratic candidates something substantial to highlight in the midterms. Americans currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the world, and millions of them struggle to afford their medications—insulin here costs roughly six times as much as it does in Canada and about nine times as much as it does in Britain. The need for green-energy incentives barely needs repeating. They are essential if the United States is to get anywhere near Biden’s goal of halving the country’s carbon emissions from their 2005 levels by 2030. And, at a time of historic inequality, the Trump-G.O.P. tax cuts for the rich were an abomination. Reversing the ones for corporations and the wealthy would make the tax system more equitable, and the taxes recovered could help finance the rest of the package.
Schumer and Manchin haven’t revealed many details of their conversations, and, after what happened last year, there is healthy skepticism that legislation could actually be enacted. But there’s still a glimmer of hope. “It’s not dead but it’s also not a certainty; we are trying,” one Democratic source on Capitol Hill told me.
One reason for skepticism is a tight timetable. When Congress returns from the Memorial Day break next week, it will have just six weeks of full sessions before the summer recess. If a new tax-and-spending bill is to materialize, its outlines would probably have to be agreed on this month; this is a big ask. To gain Manchin’s support, other Democrats would almost certainly be forced to accept a deficit-neutral, or even deficit-reducing, package. At a time of low interest rates, the economic arguments for financing long-term climate investments in this way are weak, but Manchin seems to be insisting on it.
For his part, the senator from West Virginia would have to agree not to sabotage the clean-energy part of the new bill, something he is certainly capable of doing. A longtime defender of the fossil-fuel industries, Manchin has set a goal of energy independence, which—it appears—means providing more financial incentives to the oil, gas, and coal industries. Many progressive Democrats adamantly oppose making such concessions, and for good reason. This looks like a recipe for another deadlock, but, as Bernie Sanders recently commented to Politico, the devil is in the details.
What role can Biden play in all this? Wary of repeating last year’s failure, he has so far confined himself to calling on Congress to pass prescription-drug reform and other priorities. That may be a smart move, but, if the talks between Schumer and Manchin become serious, Biden could play a vital role by marketing the new bill to the public—and, perhaps, to wary Democratic lawmakers. The prescription-drug element should be the easiest sell. With inflation eating into family budgets, it would help reduce the cost of living. And, by reducing Medicare outlays, it would also save taxpayers a lot of money: about three hundred billion dollars over ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
If all else fails, the Democrats could perhaps advance a stand-alone prescription-drug-reform bill before the elections, and try to pass it through reconciliation. In politics, as in other walks of life, something beats nothing, and prescription-drug reform would certainly be something. For now, though, the focus should be on trying to salvage something broader and avoiding a repeat of last year. As distasteful as dealing with Manchin might seem, it’s unavoidable. Last week, the senator told Axios that his preliminary talks with Schumer were “respectful” and “encouraging to a certain extent.” What did that mean? Will he play the spoiler again? Quite probably, but the next six or eight weeks will provide the answer.In the past two weeks, Joe Biden has attended a summit in Asia; flown to Texas to grieve with family members of the victims of the Uvalde gun massacre; met with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, to discuss the inflation challenge; and announced a new weapons package for Ukraine.

This created a “cognitive dissonance,” he says, that prevented Ukraine from recognizing the extent of Russian aggression. Having watched as diplomacy failed, Kyslytsya still has to separate his work from the personal toll of Russia’s invasion on his family and friends. “I try not to engage emotionally because if I engage emotionally too much, I am not operational,” he says. “And if I am not operational . . .

Over-all sales generated by the private sector increased at a healthy annual rate of 3.7 per cent, which augurs well for the rest of the year.That is an accurate description of the strong first-quarter G.D.P. figures, released by the Commerce Department on Thursday morning: personal consumption increased at an annualized rate of 2.7 per cent, and nonresidential private fixed investment in equipment rose at a rate of 15.3 per cent. But this isn’t the version that was the focus of news headlines and Republican talking points.

“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.
Ironically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.
Evidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.

In a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets  and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could  clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.
But none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?
Based on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”
Based on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month.  If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.
Musk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting  misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.
In a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.
Regulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”
Musk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is."
https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/werner-herzog-has-never-liked-introspection;2022-04-26;Werner Herzog Has Never Liked Introspection;"A conversation with the filmmaker about the place of literature, the toll of war, and the conviction that his writing will outlast his movies.
He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue."

A new program lets civilians step up to help.
Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option. Terrie Shannon, a seventy-eight-year-old retired education professor, agreed to lead the circle. “I said yes partly in defiance of the people in this county who supported Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants,” she told me. None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
The women weren’t allowed to work until their paperwork was sorted out, so they spent their days padding around the retreat center in slippers crocheted by the sisters. The women began calling Shannon “Grandmother.” One afternoon, Halima invited her over to speak with her mother on FaceTime, and both older women started to cry. “I swore a sacred promise to her that I would take care of her daughter,” Shannon told me. The young women were polite and quick to smile, but any mention of life at home made them grow grim. They worried about the women they had left behind. “We want so badly for them to find a way out, too,” Akbari said. They wanted to send the pocket money they received from the Sponsor Circle—fifteen dollars a week—home to their relatives, some of whom were near starvation owing to an ongoing famine. But the volunteers worried that too much financial support would muddy the scope of their commitment to the women. Frantz, who had adopted a son from Guatemala and had experience with the complexity of distant entanglements, said, “We could set up a dependency we really can’t sustain.” In the end, though, the volunteers helped Haidari wire money home to her father, who was sick.
Frustrations mounted. For Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari, life as a high-ranking student or professional was over. “We really don’t fit in here yet, and we don’t know the language,” Akbari said. The women had been given donated computers that were nearly useless. They needed to apply for public assistance, but the system was byzantine. They had entered the country on “humanitarian parole,” which, unlike refugee status, did not guarantee that, among other things, they could stay indefinitely, and meant that they still needed to apply for asylum. But many private immigration lawyers were overwhelmed and increasingly expensive. “They are charging exorbitant rates to the most vulnerable people,” Frantz said.
Still, the women found fun where they could. They went clothes shopping, and, after months of washing their hair with dish soap in the safe houses, they each chose their own shampoo. They went to a potluck dinner at the only mosque in northeastern Minnesota. They baked bread and sang songs with the sisters. They played volleyball in the driveway and tried out snowshoeing. One weekend, members of the Sponsor Circle offered to take the four women on a church snow-tubing trip. The night before, however, when a volunteer read them the waivers that they’d need to sign, the women decided not to go. Why, after risking their lives to escape Afghanistan, would they volunteer to do something that might break their legs? “We thought it must be something very dangerous,” Khalili told me.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”
One of the most critical factors in the successful integration of immigrants is their ability to find a community, and Sponsor Circles help to create local bonds. “It’s proven to make a difference in whether or not refugees succeed,” David Miliband, the president and C.E.O. of the International Rescue Committee, told me. Maniatis, from the Open Society Foundations, told me that he hopes that involving Americans directly in resettlement efforts will help to combat anti-immigrant sentiment: “This is infrastructure that engages a community in social issues and places people at the center of the solution.” Following the success of the Sponsor Circle program, the Biden Administration has decided to launch a larger sponsorship program, which will be implemented later this year. The Administration recently committed to welcoming a hundred thousand refugees from Ukraine, and some of them will be resettled through the new sponsorship program. “The Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans has shown that everyday Americans and community groups across the country are willing and able to step up in extraordinary ways,” a State Department spokesperson told me. “The experience to date demonstrates the powerful and impactful role that Americans from all walks of life can play as they seek to welcome Afghans and now Ukrainians arriving in their communities.”
But Sponsor Circles also face challenges. The program requires that volunteers raise at least two thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars per newcomer, and pledge to help out for a minimum of three months. “It’s nowhere near enough,” Embry Howell, a health-policy expert and a member of a Sponsor Circle in the D.C. area, told me. Sponsor Circles also lack the experience of government agencies, including knowledge about how to access social workers and how to navigate the labyrinthine systems that govern Social Security and other benefits. Howell told me that one woman she works with experiences severe anxiety when using the elevator in their building—which makes it difficult for her to leave the house. “She doesn’t speak English, all of her family is in Afghanistan, and mental health is really the missing piece.”
In Duluth, Halima and the others soon found work in the kitchen of an assisted-living and health-care center associated with the Benedictine sisters. The jobs paid only thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents an hour, but they came with a signing bonus of five hundred dollars. “As soon as I get that, I’m sending the money home,” Halima told me. Within three weeks, the Sponsor Circle had found them a place to live, at a house that was formerly a rental property, and sent over a team of volunteer builders to renovate it. The night before they moved in, the Sponsor Circle held a last pizza party at the retreat center. (Some of the volunteers were surprised to find that the women, cosmopolitan Kabulis, had had pizza many times before.) The room was warm and cozy. Shannon had sewn the girls cloth bags as presents, and drew numbers to determine a fair order in which each could pick a bag. “We’re just thrilled that you chose Duluth,” Shannon said. Halima replied, “We are really happy that you are friendly people.”
It was eight degrees below zero the next morning, as the women packed the last of their duffels and drove several miles to their new home. All four set to work making their beds, unpacking newly acquired knickknacks, including Christmas ornaments, pieces of costumes, and a sparkly magic wand that Halima had collected at a church rummage sale. Akbari hung the Christmas ornaments from a light pull in her room. Halima unpacked her sketches. Flipping through them, she stopped at the faces of women she’d left behind in the safe house. “They’ve moved now,” she told me. “We text with them on Facebook, and every time they text with us asking our sponsors to help them.” She pulled out one painting she’d done at Fort Dix, a portrait of her father, and propped it on her bedside table, behind her magic wand."
https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-nuclear-reality;2022-04-23;The New Nuclear Reality;"Russia’s war in Ukraine has reawakened fears about the bomb—and endangered the principle of deterrence.
Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has jolted the world back into an uncomfortable consciousness of the nuclear threat. In the past month, official warnings have emerged at a striking pace. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former ambassador to Russia, warned on April 14th. The U.S. assessment of when and why Moscow might use such weaponry has changed, Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, conceded in testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee. A prolonged war in Ukraine will sap Russia’s manpower and matériel, while sanctions will throw the nation into an economic depression and undermine its ability to produce more precision-guided munitions and conventional arms, he said. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.” Putin’s aggression is “reviving fears” of a more “militaristic Russia.”
The Kremlin’s successful test, on April 20th, of a missile capable of flying at hypersonic speeds and carrying up to ten nuclear warheads anywhere in the world—and of outsmarting defense systems—contributed to the ominous optics. “This truly unique weapon will force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice,” Putin boasted on state television. Last month, Washington cancelled its own test of an intercontinental missile to “manage escalation,” the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, testified.
Russia has not yet repositioned its nuclear forces, Burns said, despite sabre-rattling about a heightened state of readiness. Nor is its new missile ready for deployment. But Putin’s reckless war now has a “distinct nuclear dimension”—with lessons that extend far beyond Ukraine and that will endure after the war is over, the Arms Control Association in Washington, D.C., concluded this month. Putin’s invasion “underscores the reality that nuclear weapons don’t prevent major wars,” Daryl Kimball, the organization’s executive director, told me. “U.S. and NATO nuclear weapons have proven to be useless in preventing Russian aggression against Ukraine.” The war has imperilled a long-standing premise of deterrence—having a bomb to avoid being bombed. Kimball reflected, “When nuclear deterrence fails, it fails catastrophically.”
[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]
The war in Ukraine underscores an even bigger problem. The infrastructure of global security—like the bridges, railways, and power grids that make up our physical infrastructure—is decaying. The challenge ahead is to devise a new or more stable security architecture—with treaties, verification tools, oversight, and enforcement—to replace the eroding models established after the last major war in Europe ended, seventy-seven years ago.
Putin’s invasion has also exposed changes to the global balance of nuclear power. Shortly before his retirement last month, I sat down with Kenneth (Frank) McKenzie, Jr., a four-star general who once wore a key around his neck that unlocked sensitive material necessary for the President to respond to a nuclear crisis. In what feels like a throwback to the Cold War and his early days as a young marine officer, he said, the U.S. is again focussed on nuclear threats from Moscow.  Only the capabilities have reversed. During the Cold War, between 1945 and 1989, Washington advanced its nuclear arsenal to counter Moscow’s growing might in conventional arms. In 1954, it tested a weapon a thousand times more powerful than Little Boy, the devastating bomb dropped on Hiroshima. America even produced nuclear land mines. After the Soviets got the bomb, the U.S. still had an eight-to-one advantage in nuclear capabilities during the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962. By the Cold War’s end, the U.S. had developed a “capability and capacity edge, really, over the rest of the world that appeared insurmountable,” McKenzie said.
After the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Pentagon “took a holiday” from studying high-end warfare, the general told me. “We looked away,” he said. The U.S. was drawn into a war in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, in 2001, and then opted to invade Iraq, in 2003. McKenzie was deployed in both wars. The U.S. focussed on conventional conflicts and insurgencies, while  Russia, under Putin, built up its nuclear arsenal. Today, U.S. and Russian capabilities have “completely inverted,” McKenzie said. The U.S. has superiority in conventional arms, while Moscow has more nuclear weapons—and more options to deliver them.
The type of nuclear weapons most at issue has also changed. There’s more than one. The U.S. dropped two strategic nuclear bombs on Japan. Strategic weapons are long-range—they travel some three thousand miles—and produce high-yield explosions. They can destroy vast swaths of land and any human within range. Russia currently has just over six thousand strategic warheads; the U.S. has fifty-five hundred. Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, the two countries negotiated several treaties to limit strategic weapons, though all but one have since been scrapped. The New START treaty is the only surviving bilateral pact; it was extended for five years shortly after Biden’s Inauguration, but it seems more tenuous now.
The other type of nuclear weapons are tactical, or nonstrategic, which the U.S. is more worried about today. They are shorter-range—they travel up to three hundred miles—and often have lower-yield warheads. (Some, though, carry more kilotons than the Hiroshima bomb.) They are designed to take out tank or troop formations on a battlefield—not wipe out a city. In the history of nuclear weapons, there has never been a treaty—bilateral or international—that limits developing or deploying tactical nukes anywhere. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union produced thousands each, with Moscow controlling up to twenty-five thousand. Afterward, the U.S. dismantled most of its tactical arsenal and withdrew most of those weapons from Europe. Russia kept more of its stockpile. There is now a vast disparity in tactical arsenals. Last month, the Congressional Research Service reported that Russia has up to two thousand tactical nukes, while the U.S. has around two hundred.
Today, Russia also has many more delivery systems for tactical nuclear weapons—submarine torpedoes, ballistic missiles on land or sea, artillery shells, and aircraft—while the U.S. has only gravity bombs that can be dropped from warplanes. “They have more diverse capabilities than we do,” McKenzie concluded. More than a hundred U.S. tactical nukes are again situated in Europe, at bases in five NATO countries: Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey. Most of Russia’s are on its western front, near the borders of NATO members.
Four scenarios may lead Russia to use a nuclear weapon, according to Kimball of the Arms Control Association. To coerce Kyiv or its NATO allies to back down, Putin could carry out a “demonstration” bombing in the atmosphere above the Arctic Ocean or the Baltic Sea—not for killing, but “to remind everyone that Russia has nuclear weapons.” Russia could also use tactical weapons to change the military balance on the ground with Ukraine. If the war expands, and NATO gets drawn into the fight, Russia could further escalate the conflict with the use of short-range nuclear weapons. “Both U.S. and Russian policy leave open the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to an extreme non-nuclear threat,” Kimball said. Finally, if Putin believes that the Russian state (or leadership) is at risk, he might use a tactical nuclear weapon to “save Russia from a major military defeat.” Russia has lost some twenty-five per cent of its combat power in the last two months,  a Pentagon official estimated this week. Moscow’s military doctrine reserves the right to use nuclear weapons “in response to the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction” against Russia or its allies, and also in response to aggression via conventional weapons “when the very existence of the state is threatened.” In military jargon, the country’s policy is “to escalate to de-escalate,” Richard Burt, the lead negotiator on the original START accord, which was signed by Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush in 1991, told me. “The idea is to so shock the adversary that a nuclear weapon has been used, to demonstrate your resolve that you’re willing to use a nuclear weapon, that you paralyze your adversary.”
The new nuclear reality poses another challenge: how to limit nuclear weapons beyond Russia and the United States. Nine nations now have nuclear capabilities. Putin’s war undermines the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the cornerstone of international arms control since 1968. It is the only binding commitment—now signed by almost two hundred states—that seeks to disarm those nations which have the bomb and to prevent others from getting it. The treaty is based on the U.N. Charter, which stipulates that all nations must refrain “from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
Since the nineteen-sixties, experts have debated whether Washington and Moscow would use a limited number of tactical nuclear weapons on a conventional battlefield—for example, to destroy a military position or gain a chunk of territory. “The answer is no,” Kimball said. “There is nothing like a limited nuclear war.” At the end of his military career, McKenzie, who spent more than four decades preparing for wars of all kinds, reflected on the nuclear stakes. “We should be rattled right now,” he said. “I am rattled. I’m concerned about where we are.” Three decades after Gorbachev’s speech, the respite now seems illusory."

In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars."

Jean-Marie’s daughter, Marine, was running in the French Presidential election for the second time that year, and I was there to profile him for the Washington Post. On April 24th, she will again face off against Emmanuel Macron, in the final round of the vote. The two sparred in a lengthy debate on April 20th, during which Macron hammered Marine for her admiration of Vladimir Putin and reliance on a Russian bank, and she attacked him for ignoring the plight of ordinary citizens. The far right has not been this close to power in France since 1944. Marine has styled herself as a candidate of almost grandmotherly compassion, focussing on the rising cost of living and posing for photos with her cats.

Since March 6th, when Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow and primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave an incendiary homily likening Russia’s invasion to a culture war against the West, plenty of questions have been asked about his role and his motives. Is he a tool of Vladimir Putin or Putin’s spiritual adviser? Is his vision of “Russky Mir” (“Russian World”) the basis for Putin’s war or just a rhetorical glaze applied to it? How can a religious leader with any integrity support so brutal a war, and might another leader—Pope Francis, with whom Kirill entered into dialogue in 2016—persuade him to withdraw his support and urge Putin to stand down?"

In the middle of March, bulldozers dug trenches in an unused field at the edge of the Yalovshchina cemetery, in the city of Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine. By that point, Chernihiv had been under effective blockade for more than two weeks, with most buildings left without electricity, heat, or water. Roads and bridges leading out of town had either been bombed or were now the site of active battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces. All the while, the Russian military pummelled Chernihiv with bombing raids and missile fire, turning a locked-in city into an urban death trap. As many as fifty people were killed each day, struck down while in line for food or huddling in their apartments.
Where to bury them? The city’s main cemetery, on the northern outskirts of town, was under constant bombardment. Supply routes were blocked, and no factories or workshops were open, which meant it wasn’t possible to produce enough caskets to keep up with the bodies piling up at the morgue. Finally a solution was reached: during episodic lulls in bombardment, city workers would pick up a dozen or so bodies at a time, put them in caskets cobbled together from spare wood, and lower them into the ground beneath a muddy field at the Yalovshchina cemetery."

To be sure, there was bluster in Putin’s statements. The sanctions have certainly hit Russia’s economy: last weekend, the World Bank estimated that Russian G.D.P. would decline by about eleven per cent this year, noting that the country was already in “a deep recession.” But most of the sanctions still don’t apply to oil and gas, Russia’s primary exports, which are critical to the country’s trade balance and financial stability. Indeed, with the price of oil and gas having risen sharply since the war began, Russia is now earning more money on every barrel of oil and cubic foot of gas that it sells. These revenues, which often get paid in dollars and euros, are offsetting the decline in other Russian exports, providing the Kremlin with new foreign-exchange reserves, and helping to restore a degree of confidence in its banking system, which was tottering after the initial wave of sanctions."

The good news was that, in the first round of the French Presidential election, on Sunday, while Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremist, anti-republican National Rally, once again advanced to the forthcoming second round, it was with a minimal increase to her tally from five years ago, and significantly if narrowly behind that of the incumbent President, the liberal republican Emmanuel Macron. Nothing is settled, but, though a Le Pen victory in the second round, on April 24th, is not out of the question, it seems at the moment improbable. Adding the votes that went to center and left candidates in this round to Macron’s tally, and adding the votes that went to the even more extreme-right candidates to Le Pen’s, it seems unlikely—not out of the question, but unlikely—that she will be able to cross the fifty-per-cent threshold. Macron should have a small but decisive edge, especially because the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who could never bring himself to actually support Macron, repeatedly asked his voters during his concession speech never to vote for Le Pen. Certainly, not all of his followers will go to Macron, but abhorrence of the extreme right is still a stronger motive for the French left than is abhorrence of the liberal center, strong though that motive is, as well. Non-French pundits see Mélenchon as a “kingmaker,” but this misreads French tradition, by which candidates are expected to declare their second-round allegiance immediately after the first round, and minimal bargaining for support goes on after that."

Prigozhin is in the spotlight again this month as Putin, facing humiliating military setbacks in Ukraine, looks for ways to regroup on the battlefield. U.S. and British officials say that Russia is now scrambling to mobilize mercenaries from the notoriously opaque Wagner Group, which is reportedly financed by Prigozhin. NATO recently estimated that up to fifteen thousand Russians have been killed in just the first four weeks of the war—about the same as the Soviet Union lost during its decade-long invasion of Afghanistan. Russia is expected to redirect more than a thousand mercenaries in the Wagner Group, including senior leaders, from wars on other continents to Ukraine, the British Ministry of Defense said, last week.  Because of the “largely stalled invasion,” it added, “Russia has highly likely been forced to reprioritise Wagner personnel for Ukraine at the expense of operations in Africa and Syria.”"

So far, the most widely noted area of overlap between the Ukrainian tragedy and global warming has had to do with energy. The fact that Russia’s war machine is funded by fossil fuel, and that Putin uses control of gas supplies to intimidate Western Europe, has begun to shake up energy policy: Germany has moved up its target date for a conversion to clean energy, for instance. And, if the Biden Administration has caved to Big Oil’s insistence on increasing the supply of hydrocarbons, at least that stance is being more urgently and broadly questioned. Last week, in the Times, Thomas Friedman insisted that, instead of doubling down on fossil fuels, we should “double the pace of our transition” off them, because “nothing would threaten Putin more than that,” and because the temperature in the Antarctic last month was seventy degrees above normal. “Our civilization simply cannot afford this anymore,” he wrote, a point underlined by today’s release of a dire and comprehensive report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."

This year, the Grammys were held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, a pandemic-related shift from their usual home in Los Angeles. The new location made an already overdone extravaganza feel several measures more lurid (“No one wants to go to that gross ass town,” an anonymous flack told Page Six earlier this week). There can’t be many music fans left who truly believe that the Grammys are a relevant marker of our cultural hungers or tell a story about the best art produced in a given year, though relevance itself feels like an awkward metric in an era in which the very idea of a consolidated mainstream—that there is a global “music” and we can gather to judge it qualitatively—is increasingly absurd. Despite the self-branding as “Music’s Biggest Night,” the Grammys rarely speak in a coherent or edifying way to present trends in music; at this point in the show’s history, there’s not even a significant sales bump for the big winners. (The economist Will Page recently told the Times that Taylor Swift’s 2021 Album of the Year win, for “folklore,” netted her only an additional fifty-thousand dollars in royalties.)

The economic sphere is where Ukraine’s allies, in Washington and Brussels and Tokyo and London and Berlin, have most readily confronted the Kremlin—freezing assets, applying sanctions, working to insure that few are willing to sell what Moscow wants to buy. But, however likely these measures are to choke the Russian economy in the medium term, it’s been hard to see any real effect on the war machine. “When people are saying the sanctions are working, in our view it’s really ridiculous,” Ustenko said. “Even today—the capital, they bombed all night.

The leaders of the Gulf states have been increasingly chagrined by the lack of a U.S. response to the various attacks that Iran’s Houthi proxies in Yemen have made on the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia during the past few months—including, most recently, a strike on a Saudi Aramco facility, on March 25th. Indeed, Saudi Arabia and Jordan were not represented in person at the summit, although their interests were. (“The Saudis were the real enablers of the meeting,” Cymerman said.) According to Axios, Blinken asked Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, at a pre-summit meeting on Sunday, what alternative Israel proposed to a new deal—other than a U.S.-led, preëmptive strike, which Israel continues to prepare for but, particularly given the situation in Ukraine, the Biden Administration would not want to entertain. Bennett reportedly said that he believed Iran might be deterred from enriching uranium to weapons grade if it knew that the U.S. and European countries would intensify sanctions to the extreme levels they have placed on Russia. Since Israel has not joined in those sanctions, one can only wonder how Blinken received the suggestion."

“I don’t think we can say that, on the whole, people in Russia love this war—that they like the idea of going off in search of conquest,” Alexey Bessudnov, a professor of sociology at the University of Exeter, told me. “But I think it would be equally false to say it’s all the Kremlin, that they are simply inventing these figures, that they don’t reflect reality.” People are supporting something, Bessudnov said, but “we should remember what people have in mind when they say they support what is happening in Ukraine.” He pointed out that the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center used phrasing in its survey—“Do you support the decision made for Russia to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine?”—that mimicked Putin’s own. “First, this decision has already been taken, which is a kind of hint right there,” Bessudnov said. “And, second, it’s a ‘special operation,’ not an invasion or war.”"

The polling data confirm the political threat that rising inflation  presents to the White House and, by extension, to Democrats hoping to maintain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections. In the Associated Press/NORC poll, about seven in ten respondents said that the economy is in bad shape, which simply isn’t true if you go by G.D.P. growth (6.9 per cent at an annualized rate in the last quarter of 2021) or the unemployment rate (3.8 per cent in February). Rising prices—particularly the prices of some highly visible items in the family budget—are now at the root of people’s economic concerns. Sixty-eight per cent of respondents to the Associated Press/NORC poll said that they are “Extremely concerned/Very concerned” about high gas prices impacting their family finances, and fifty-nine per cent gave the same response for groceries. As the cost of gasoline has risen by about forty per cent in the past twelve months, and the cost of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs has risen by thirteen per cent, these concerns are comprehensible."

Newsletters began as handwritten correspondences in ancient Rome, transmitting the news of the day from person to person. Later, they became one of the first forms of printed media, and eventually evolved into newspapers. In recent years, they’ve taken on a new form—as digital missives that arrive in our in-boxes. It was the newsletter’s original incarnation—the letter—that inspired us as we began to reimagine the Daily."

In Moscow, there had also been a sense that the Russian government benefitted from the presence of foreign journalists. Michael Slackman, the assistant managing editor for the Times’ international coverage and a former Moscow correspondent for Newsday, pointed out that the paper had remained in the country throughout the reign of Stalin and the entirety of the Cold War. “Typically there is an understanding that having independent journalists on the ground, if nothing else, is a degree of legitimacy internationally,” Slackman told me. “It allows people to understand your story and your side and your culture and your way of thinking.”"

“The Ukraine” was one of these stories writers love: it came into my mind as one whole piece. It was November, 2017. I was travelling back from a distant village in the mountains, and travelling meant changing buses and marshrutkas, the minibuses used for public transportation. Maybe it was the foggy November weather and the sleep deprivation. The dreamlike, surreal surroundings made me listen to bits of conversations, take in every sensory aspect, and I felt this aching, acute love for everyone and everything around, all the obvious imperfections included."

Desperate to keep the broadcast short, the producers shunted eight categories of awards to the hour before the broadcast—and yet the ceremony ran three hours and forty minutes. Grasping for a larger viewership after last year’s precipitous decline, the producers added two fan-centered segments that stopped the proceedings in their tracks. Trying to gin up enthusiasm for movies themselves, the show looked back nostalgically at James Bond, “The Godfather” movies, “White Men Can’t Jump,” “Pulp Fiction,” even “Juno,” as if to undermine whatever enthusiasm viewers may have for today’s films and to make the luminaries in the hall look like overshadowed latecomers."

What modern Russian economists have done is assemble an immense stockpile of foreign currency and gold: six hundred and thirty billion dollars, thirteen per cent of it in renminbi, twenty-two per cent of it in gold, and much of the balance in the major currencies of the economic West—euros, dollars, yen, pounds. The Russian currency stockpile eventually grew so vast that some Western financial analysts described it as “Fortress Russia”—if Russia were to be isolated in the event of a war, and the value of the ruble were to degrade, the foreign currencies could be used to stabilize the Russian economy and prevent a crisis. In the medium term, at least, these reserves seemed to provide an economic buffer for Putin. Even if Europe were to cut off all imports of Russian energy, depriving Moscow of its main source of revenue, one analyst at the Atlantic Council told the Times, the reserves would allow Moscow to fill the gap for “several years.”"

I travelled with Albright during her four years as Secretary of State. She was a devout diplomat and frenetic traveller well into her sixties. In 1997, we zigzagged across ten countries on three continents in twelve days, including a meeting, at an ungodly hour, at U.N. offices in Geneva, between stops in London, Islamabad, Delhi, Riyadh, Vancouver, and other cities I barely remember. She outlasted us all. Although barely five feet tall, Albright had no qualms about taking on dictators. She confronted Saddam Hussein over his reported arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and made the first trip by a senior U.S. official to North Korea to negotiate with Kim Jong Il on ballistic missiles. She succeeded in neither quest, but she was always willing to try."

Such scenes were fairly routine in classical music through most of the twentieth century, as one country or another took its turn in the role of arch-villain on the international stage. Today, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created a cultural panic of a kind that has not been seen in generations. Several performers with strong ties to Vladimir Putin—Valery Gergiev, Anna Netrebko, Denis Matsuev—have seen their careers in Europe and America evaporate. In a few isolated cases, classic Russian works have been pulled from programs. At the beginning of March, the Polish National Opera called off a staging of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov” that had been scheduled for the spring. A few days later, Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” and his Second Symphony were dropped from a concert by the Cardiff Philharmonic—a decision that elicited worldwide mockery on social media."

The video—which spread widely, racking up at least sixteen million views—was not the product of local YouTubers or activists on Telegram. It was a piece of journalism by Russian freelancers working for Nastoyashcheye Vremya, or Current Time, a twenty-four-hour Russian-language television and digital channel that has broadcast from Prague since 2017—and which is funded by the U.S. Congress. Part of a system that traces its roots to the Cold War, Current Time is a product of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in coöperation with the Voice of America, two pillars of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a branch of the American government that has grown over the decades to encompass five news networks and a technology incubator. (Though it is tempting to assume that these are propaganda outlets—and the Trump Administration attempted to make them precisely that—anyone who has tuned in recently knows that their news programs often cover negative features of American life. Their purpose is more fundamental; as the agency puts it, they seek to provide “unbiased news and information in countries where the press is restricted.”)"

Cowan and Greene have similar positions on many issues, including abortion and gun rights, but Cowan does not believe that the 2020 election was stolen, and, though he voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he had come to see the former President as a threat to democracy after the insurrection at the Capitol. He knew those convictions put him out of step with many voters in the district. Still, he maintained that most local elected officials were fed up with “Empty G”—a play on the congresswoman’s initials that he was fond of—and told me that Party strategists he’d spoken to in D.C. wished they could replace her. He hoped, too, that redistricting might make the district more moderate and set the stage for a more competitive rematch."

The scene is notable for its nearly wordless choreography, and for the tenderness with which it depicts a spontaneous late-night bonding activity between mother and child. It’s also, by my lights, one of the great onscreen food scenes in recent memory. As the camera lingers on the mint bits falling into the bowl or the syrup glugging out of the jar, Sam’s eyes linger on her child. She seems equally awed that Frankie knows how to take care of her and mournful that Frankie is growing up and needs her less."

But it’s not clear why, or whether that pattern will hold.
There are many theories floating around as to why the Russians didn’t go all-out and take down Ukraine’s cellular networks, electric grid, municipal water supplies, and other crucial utilities, either in the run-up to war or in its first days. It may be that the Kremlin, high on its own propaganda, believed that the Russian army would conquer Ukraine in record time and install a puppet government that would need to have those services intact. When that didn’t happen and the Russians began bombing cities, it made cyber weapons that could turn off the lights, say, largely beside the point: a bomb dropped on a power plant is a definitive way to destroy it, with little chance that it will come back online. “If you’re already at a stage in a conflict where you’re willing to drop bombs, you’re going to drop bombs,” Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who is a former Air Force intelligence analyst, told me. In other words, bombs are blunter, more peremptory instruments."

I visited Kharkiv less than a month before Russian missiles started striking it. Most of the people I met there—and all of the men whom I met there—told me that they, and the city, were ready for war. They thought they knew what war was. A Russian-orchestrated attempt to take over the city had failed in 2014, but, just to the east of Kharkiv, an occupation regime was established, and a shooting war went on for eight years. A giant blue-and-yellow tent in Freedom Square, with a banner that said “Everything for victory,” stood as a stubborn reminder that the war wasn’t over. Then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Within a few weeks, Kharkiv was unrecognizable."

The campaign could have severe repercussions for the Russian people.
Khandelwal remembers the last phone call he had with several talented young workers in Myanmar who had helped administer his surveys. “Things were going great,” he told me. “They had a sense that the next year would be brighter than the previous year. That keeps you investing in your own future.” Many of them were in their twenties and had come of age during an evolving democratic government; they were filled with hopes and aspirations. “The day after the coup, you could hear that something they had been envisioning, a brighter future, was just gone,” Khandelwal said. “It was very sad, and there was nothing you could do.”"

The area, which is several hours south of Lviv, has become a shelter for displaced people, Bogdan Bolkhovetsky, Davydov’s colleague, told me. Bolkhovetsky, Kraina FM’s station general manager, said that he and Davydov had arrived in the village “by pure chance.” The west of the country is full of refugees, and there are few places for families to stay as they make their way toward the borders of Europe. “We found this place because it was the only place vacant,” Bolkhovetsky said. They arrived in the evening on February 27th; just days later they were setting up the station in a sloped-ceilinged, wood-panelled space that barely fit their two desks. They acquired laptops and a mixer from the supply of aid making its way from the rest of Europe to Ukraine. “We called our friends in Austria and they were so quick,” Bolkhovetsky said. “Guys we’ve never met just sent us the equipment, and a friend of ours brought this equipment in. I mean, they brought us these German laptops and the mixing console and we’ve never seen these people before.”"

What unites these two crises is combustion. Burning fossil fuel has driven the temperature of the planet ever higher, melting most of the sea ice in the summer Arctic, bending the jet stream, and slowing the Gulf Stream. And selling fossil fuel has given Putin both the money to equip an army (oil and gas account for sixty per cent of Russia’s export earnings) and the power to intimidate Europe by threatening to turn off its supply. Fossil fuel has been the dominant factor on the planet for centuries, and so far nothing has been able to profoundly alter that. After Putin invaded, the American Petroleum Institute insisted that our best way out of the predicament was to pump more oil. The climate talks in Glasgow last fall, which John Kerry, the U.S. envoy, had called the “last best hope” for the Earth, provided mostly vague promises about going “net-zero by 2050”; it was a festival of obscurantism, euphemism, and greenwashing, which the young climate activist Greta Thunberg summed up as “blah, blah, blah.” Even people trying to pay attention can’t really keep track of what should be the most compelling battle in human history."

For months, critics—most prominent among them, the Harvard professor and sometime aspirant for Powell’s job, Larry Summers—have been slamming the Fed for not responding quickly enough to rising prices. The thrust of this criticism is that, by waiting too long, the Fed is more likely to have to raise interest rates to a degree that could well cause the economy to nosedive. “The next recession probably has ‘mistaken monetary policy’ written all over it,” Summers said, earlier this month. Still, Powell appeared unruffled by Lawrence’s question.“We have the tools that we need, and we are going to use them,” he responded calmly. Answering another question, he conceded that, with the benefit of hindsight, “it would have been appropriate to move earlier.” But he also emphasized that the Fed’s main policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, is committed to bringing down inflation. “As I looked around that table at today’s meeting, I saw a committee that is acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability,” Powell said."

But Biden has refused Ukraine’s two biggest requests.
In a concise eighteen minutes, Zelensky outlined an ambitious wish list of actions both to help Ukraine and punish Russia. He once again called for the West to create a no-fly zone—to “close the skies” and to limit the ability of Russian warplanes to strike Ukraine’s cities. If a no-fly zone was “too much to ask,” Zelensky appealed for more advanced missile-defense systems and aircraft. “I call on you to do more!” he said. Despite growing pressure from Congress, President Joe Biden has resisted Zelensky’s request for the no-fly zone, and for the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly. Washington fears that any direct U.S. intervention could spark a wider conflict. “That’s called World War Three,” Biden said last week. Zelensky also asked the U.S. to sanction every Russian politician and widen the economic dragnet. “I am asking that Russians do not receive a single penny they can use to destroy Ukraine,” he said. He encouraged individual lawmakers to mobilize aid and support for Ukraine from companies in their districts."

When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th, launching a vicious war that has already killed thousands of Ukrainians and driven nearly three million from the country, Peckmezian’s portraits became documents of a past suddenly lost, of youth ruptured by violence and grief. Speaking recently by phone, Varvara, a young woman whom Peckmezian met in Kyiv, was in tears from the beginning of the call to the end. Sergey, who appears as a beautiful boy in Peckmezian’s portrait from Kyiv, was now sitting in the dark because of the city’s curfew—light in the window might attract bombers. Of the eleven young people I was able to reach last week, some had escaped to the relative safety of western Ukraine. Others had made it out of the country, and several remained in Kyiv or its outskirts. Those from the eastern Ukrainian territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, which were seized by Russia-backed separatists in 2014, are experiencing their second displacement in less than a decade.

Chelsea is Abramovich’s best-known asset, ahead of his super yachts, Kensington mansion, and twenty-nine-per-cent stake in Evraz, a mining-and-steel company that the British government believes may have supplied the Russian military and whose board members included, until recently, a former private secretary to Prince Charles. (Evraz says it has sold steel only to Russia’s “infrastructure and construction sectors.”) At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea’s stadium, in West London, the merchandise store closed and went offline. The club’s credit cards were suspended. Ticket sales ceased. The government granted a special license for Chelsea to play out its schedule for the rest of the season, so as not to wreck competitions for other teams, but capped its spending on travelling to and hosting matches to twenty thousand pounds and nine hundred thousand pounds per game, respectively."

That call would seem to vindicate what is almost universally framed as Bennett’s “mediation efforts.” They began in earnest a week before, on March 5th, when Bennett travelled to Moscow at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, with whom the Israeli government, backed by two-thirds of Israeli citizens, continues to maintain normal, if cooled, relations. Zelensky had apparently urged Bennett to attend the meeting, which, Bennett’s office said, had the “blessing and encouragement of all parties”—a seeming reference to the Biden Administration. It lasted three hours—Bennett, an Orthodox Jew, flew on the Sabbath to attend, a violation except when “saving lives.” When the meeting was over, he flew to Germany for talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and reportedly spoke with Zelensky by phone early the next morning—their third conversation in twenty-four hours. “The moment there is even a small opening, and we have the access to all sides and the capability, I see it as a moral duty to make every attempt,” Bennett told the Israeli Cabinet when he was back in Jerusalem."

But the longer the war goes on, the bigger the economic costs are likely to be.
This change in tone reflects several factors. The war looks likely to drag out; the United States and its allies have responded to Putin’s aggression with unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia; and the price of oil has gone up to about a hundred and ten dollars per barrel, with the distinct possibility of further increases in the months ahead. According to the American Automobile Association, the price of gas has risen to a national average of $4.33 per gallon, and exceeded seven dollars in parts of California. Higher energy costs act like a tax on the economy, depressing the level of demand for other goods and services. They also contribute to an over-all increase in consumer-price inflation, which is already at its highest rate in forty years: 7.9 per cent in February. The surge in gasoline prices that we’ve seen since the start of the conflict in Ukraine could well lift the March inflation rate to more than eight per cent."

Genocide, the word and the idea, is colloquially understood to describe an effort to exterminate members of a definable identity group through targeted killings. Because the best-known cases involve staggering death tolls—the extirpation of Native Americans and Indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada, of Armenians under the Ottomans, of European Jews in the Holocaust, of Rwandan Tutsis at the hands of Hutu Power in 1994—genocide is often assumed to mean mass slaughter, and to have drastic demographic consequences. But, in international law, genocide has nothing explicitly to do with the enormity of criminal acts. Rather, according to the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, it is defined by the enormity of criminal intent:"

But history does not always revise—J.F.K.’s conduct in the Cuban missile crisis appears, if anything, even better in retrospect than it did at the time, and at the time it seemed impressive. Far from simply staring down the Russians, as we thought then, he also showed them a way out, by secretly promising to remove American missiles from Turkey. And Winston Churchill’s speeches in 1940, whatever grimmer verdicts may be rendered about his imperialist conduct before the war and his sadly incoherent presence after, are still the clarion calls of liberty that they were for so many at the time. Those who criticize Churchill now are free to do so because he protected freedom against some of the most lethal enemies it has known."

In the world of religious diplomacy, the encounter was seen as a breakthrough. It showed Francis reaching out to the Russian Orthodox leader, as he had already reached out to the Eastern Orthodox leader, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, and suggested a fraternal evenhandedness in their dealings. It echoed the 1998 visit to Cuba of Pope John Paul II, whose meeting there with Fidel Castro was seen as the moment when that nation and the free world engaged with each other directly for the first time since the Revolution. And it brought to mind the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev pulled back from the brink of nuclear war after an intervention from Pope John XXIII, who stepped in and acted as peacemaker, sending the two leaders a message urging caution, and then reading it aloud on Vatican Radio."

Some have argued that NATO expansion in the post-Soviet era is to blame for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying that it has provoked Vladimir Putin to defend his sphere of influence.

Jane Campion, one of cinema’s true auteurs, talks with David Remnick about her new film, “The Power of the Dog”—which is set in the West but is not exactly a Western. And a staff writer who recently profiled the Brazilian musical giant Caetano Veloso picks some key tracks that illuminate Veloso’s extraordinary career.

Stephen Kotkin is one of our most profound and prodigious scholars of Russian history. His masterwork is a biography of Joseph Stalin. So far he has published two volumes—“Paradoxes of Power, 1878-1928,” which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and “Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941.” A third volume will take the story through the Second World War; Stalin’s death, in 1953; and the totalitarian legacy that shaped the remainder of the Soviet experience. Taking advantage of long-forbidden archives in Moscow and beyond, Kotkin has written a biography of Stalin that surpasses those by Isaac Deutscher, Robert Conquest, Robert C. Tucker, and countless others.
Kotkin has a distinguished reputation in academic circles. He is a professor of history at Princeton University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. He has myriad sources in various realms of contemporary Russia: government, business, culture. Both principled and pragmatic, he is also more plugged in than any reporter or analyst I know. Ever since we met in Moscow, many years ago—Kotkin was doing research on the Stalinist industrial city of Magnitogorsk—I’ve found his guidance on everything from the structure of the Putin regime to its roots in Russian history to be invaluable."

Ten years later, Hamilton is a global superstar with seven world championships under his belt—and six wins in Austin—but Formula 1 is only just beginning to persuade America’s stubborn sports-watching audience. It was not the sensory effect of the cars that accomplished such a mission, but reality television. For the last three years, Netflix has masterfully chronicled the grand melodramas and intricate microdynamics of Formula 1 (which is often characterized as a travelling circus) in a tight, zippy series called “Drive to Survive,” a show that largely overlooks the complex and fiercely guarded technological aspects of the sport in favor of its delicious and diverse buffet of big personalities. International playboys, Machiavellian billionaires, humble heroes, racing-world royalty, overachieving underdogs, aging has-beens, hotheaded bullies: “Drive to Survive” has them all. “Formula 1 is the ultimate competition: you’ve got drama, competitiveness, high stakes, politics,” Christian Horner, a steely Brit married to Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and the team boss of Red Bull, says. Horner, a game participant in the show, is portrayed as a weasel constantly maneuvering to gain favor with the sport’s governing body. (He’s described by a rival team boss as “a bit like a Jack Russell terrier who will snap at your heels.”) “The drivers have an almost fighter-pilot-like mentality,” Horner tells the camera."

On Tuesday, a new U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia will pursue its interests in “competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways, including pressing to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad.’ ” In testimony on the Hill, William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former Ambassador to Russia, was pressed about Vladimir Putin’s intent. “He’s not going to stop at Ukraine, correct?” asked Representative Jackie Speier, of California. Burns replied, “That’s what makes it more important than ever to demonstrate that he’s not going to succeed in Ukraine.” The stakes, Burns acknowledged, are bigger. “This is one of those pivotal points where we and all of our allies and partners need to act.”"

David and Goliath! Progressive socialist guerrillas, undogmatic and good-looking, too! The world went wild; I went wild. With no previous experience in journalism, or even a remote interest in it, I borrowed money for a plane ticket, flew from my home in Mexico City to Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, and spent the next eleven months reporting on the national uprising. On July 17, 1979, Somoza fled into exile. Two days later, the Sandinistas entered Managua. I had seen for myself the revolutionary fervor throughout the country, and now, together with the crowd, I saw the nine comandantes of the Sandinista leadership—Los Nueve—for the first time, standing on a jerry-built platform, wide-eyed in the central plaza where you couldn’t fit another pin, moved beyond tears, unable to believe that twenty years of sacrifice and struggle had finally led to this, to this crowd."

Putin’s capacity to wage this hideous war depends at home on his capacity to sell his fables of Moscow’s valiant “de-Nazification” of Ukraine. To create the comprehensive information vacuum that he requires, he has jailed his most vivid political rival, Alexey Navalny; intimidated other opponents into exile or silence; declared street protests or dissenting social-media posts crimes punishable by lengthy prison terms; and shuttered the last of Moscow’s independent news outlets. Many of the reporters from those outlets––Echo of Moscow, TV Rain, and others––have, with good reason, left the Russian capital for the safety of Yerevan, Baku, Tbilisi, and points west."

The quick tabloid-media encounter served as a neat encapsulation of what makes West’s career and comportment unique. He is a product, and a longtime inhabitant, of the academy, having taught in tenured positions at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Union Seminary. But he has made it a point of pride to apply his analysis to popular culture and, on occasion, to do so in popular forums. After writing academic manifestos such as “Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity” (1982), he achieved a new degree of fame with “Race Matters,” from 1993, a collection of self-consciously populist essays addressing such hot-button topics as the Rodney King riots, affirmative action, and Black-Jewish relations. More recently, he joined the online adult-education behemoth MasterClass to teach a course on philosophy. In both 2016 and 2020, he served as a tireless surrogate for Bernie Sanders’s Presidential campaign, delivering stem-winders across the country."

During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed Russian military strategy, why Ukraine has proved more difficult for Russian forces than Syria, and what the Syrian intervention suggests about how Putin sees Russia’s place in the world."

Jason Blevins and Olena Lysenko’s “I Never Had Dreams of My Son” follows the father who has never stopped searching for him.
Eight years ago, when Kyiv erupted in fiery anti-Russian demonstrations, the filmmakers Jason Blevins and Olena Lysenko walked a sprawling protest camp on Maidan Square interviewing students, activists, medics, and self-defense volunteers gathered there. Among them was Oleksii Shevliuha, a thirty-five-year-old security guard who seemed to know everyone. Wiry and compact, with a soldier’s upright bearing and the close-cropped hair of a Cossack, he became their guide and occasional protector. He introduced them around the encampment, lent them a hand—and the use of a pocket knife—when their camera stand broke. He gave an account of the history of the Ukrainian self-determination movement, which he had joined in his youth. “I am fighting for my country to finally start living in a new way,” he told them. “For the people to become the rulers in their own country.”
In February of 2014, Ukraine’s pro-Russia regime collapsed, but a separatist conflict, kindled by Moscow, continued in the country’s east. Shevliuha decided to sign up for active duty. He called his father, Oleksandr, at home in Karlivka, an industrial town east of Kyiv, to tell him about his plans, and was relieved when Oleksandr did not discourage him. After a few weeks of training, he deployed to Ilovaisk, in the separatist Donetsk region, as a bomb-defusing specialist. He was there in August of 2014, when heavy fighting was under way. Two days after he arrived at the front line, his phone went dead. Today, Shevliuha is one of some seven hundred and fifty Ukrainian fighters who remain missing since the first phase of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, late last month, there’s no telling how high their number will grow."

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, made an explicit plea on Twitter. “I will not be diplomatic on this,” he wrote. “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too.

The group pulled over a kilometre from the bridge, making sure to turn their vehicle around so it was pointed back toward Kyiv, in case they needed to make a getaway. They walked past a Ukrainian checkpoint and found themselves in front of the bridge, where ten to fifteen soldiers and civilians were working to help people cross the river on wooden planks. The sound of shelling seemed to be drawing closer, so Sessini took cover near a church. He was about to try to cross a street when he heard a large explosion. A mortar had landed several metres away. A piece of shrapnel struck Maxim Dondyuk, a Ukrainian photographer traveling with Sessini, in the right shoulder, resulting in what he described as a superficial wound. They decided to retreat toward the car. “It was too dangerous,” Sessini told me. They were making their way back through the town when another shell landed nearby. “That’s when I took the picture of the family,” Sessini said."

The letter “Z” was spotted on some Russian military vehicles in the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24th. At least two other letters seemed to be in use as well: “V” and “O.” (Ukrainian and Russian both use a Cyrillic alphabet, which contains neither “Z” nor “V.”) On March 2nd, what appears to have been the first attempt at interpreting the symbol appeared in state-controlled Russian media: a military expert suggested that the letter “Z” stood for the last name of the Ukrainian President, Zelensky, and “V” and “O” stood for his first name and patronymic, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. The following day, the Russian Defense Ministry’s Instagram account began publishing graphics with stylized letters “Z” and “V,” and captions offering different interpretations: “Z” could be read as the first letter of the Russian word “za” (“for”), so “Z” could mean “for victory,” “for peace,” “for truth,” and “for the children of Donbass.” “Z” could also be the first letter in the Russian “zakanchivaem”—“we end,” and so could stand for “We end wars.” It could also be the “Z” in “de-Nazification” (though this would require using the English word) and “demilitarizatsiya,” or demilitarization. (The war is framed in Russia in terms of forcing peace upon Ukraine.) Options offered for the “V” included the Russian preposition “v”—“in”—in the phrase “strength is in truth,” and an international symbol for victory, for which the Defense Ministry’s social-media managers offered the tagline “The task will be completed.”"

To a degree that has startled experts in the opaque byways of international finance, the invasion of Ukraine has engendered a systematic campaign to sever Russia from the global banking system, and to sunder the Russian élite from their estates, vessels, and fortunes from the Caymans to Sardinia to Central Park. Since the Russian attack began on February 24th, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union have expanded the list of Russian billionaires under sanctions to at least sixteen. In his State of the Union address, on March 1st, Joe Biden said bluntly, “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.” The next day, the Justice Department detailed a new “KleptoCapture” task force, targeting Russian officials and well-connected élites. In the British capital—mockingly nicknamed Londongrad for the profusion of Russian fortunes—lawyers, bankers, and spin doctors are under pressure to stop helping oligarchs avoid scrutiny. Even Switzerland, which is so devoted to pecuniary secrecy that its journalists can be jailed for writing about financial leaks, has frozen Russian financial assets, including those of Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and nearly four hundred others."

https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-sanctions-too-often-fail;2022-03-07;Why Sanctions Too Often Fail;"The West has mobilized vast economic weaponry against Russia. But sanctions do not always produce meaningful or timely change.
Yet sanctions generate meaningful change only about forty per cent of the time. Years of sanctions failed in North Korea, Venezuela, and Iraq. Cuba has faced layers of U.S. trade and arms embargoes since 1960. The Communist regime is still in power. The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, faced multiple sanctions for his brutal repression after the Arab Spring uprising, in 2011, turned into a civil war. Hundreds of thousands have died, yet Assad is still firmly entrenched in Damascus. Sanctions are often sagas. Success in South Africa took three decades. The Iran model, which the U.S. has invoked for Russia, has had gyrating effects. Sanctions also produce heartbreak. The agony is the differential in timing. A gun, shell, or bomb can kill in seconds. Sanctions take a comparative eon in the scheme of war or a humanitarian crisis. “They rarely work,” Benn Steil, of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “But, when they do work, they tend to take a very long time.”"

Prices at the pump already top four dollars a gallon in some states, and Joe Biden’s approval rating stands at just forty-two per cent, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average, so it’s easy to see why the prospect of another rise in prices would alarm some people in the White House. But, with Russia’s government reliant on energy exports for about forty per cent of its income, the moral argument for cutting off these mammoth revenue streams is hard to counter. “The world is paying Russia seven hundred million dollars a day for oil and four hundred million dollars for natural gas,” Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, told me, in a telephone interview from Kyiv this weekend. “You are paying all this money to a murderous leader who is still killing people in my country.”"

In “The Bard of Eastern Ukraine,” from 2016, Marci Shore writes about the Ukrainian writer and poet Serhiy Zhadan, whose novel “Voroshilovgrad” is set in Donbas, the region where Putin initiated his invasion of Ukraine eleven days ago. As Shore observes, with eerie prescience, Zhadan’s book, though set in 2009, “has become the novel of our present moment, an intimate sojourn in a long-neglected Soviet borderland that is now threatening to bring about the fall of Europe.” In “The Weight of Words,” Masha Gessen examines the moral authority of the Russian activist and fiction writer Lyudmila Ulitskaya. In “Under Siege,” Masha’s brother Keith Gessen considers the complicated legacy of the Russian novelist Vasily Grossman. And, from 2019, here is an excerpt from the Ukrainian-American poet Ilya Kaminsky’s collection “Deaf Republic.” In his introduction, the poetry editor Kevin Young observes that Kaminsky, whose family fled Ukraine in 1993, writes about deafness and war in ways that arouse the conscience: “Kaminsky, who is hard of hearing himself, has the citizens of this republic speak with hand gestures and signs—some of which punctuate and animate the poems—as they resist a world of misunderstanding and military violence.”"

As always, it is important to note that month-to-month job figures bounce around quite a bit. But the February report showed that the economy has displayed sustained strength: the employment figures for December and January were revised upward, and the updated figures show that the economy has created almost 1.75 million jobs over the past three months. That’s close to six hundred thousand a month—roughly three times the rate before the pandemic.  Since November, the employment-to-population ratio, which is a broad measure of the labor market’s strength, has risen by six-tenths of a percentage point to 59.9%, the highest since the pandemic began. That, too, is a positive sign—especially during a period when the Omicron wave spread across the country."

Russia is unleashing a wave of destruction against Ukraine, the neighbor that Vladimir Putin claims is historically part of Russia. Joshua Yaffa, who is reporting on the war from within Ukraine, and Masha Gessen, who has been reporting from Moscow on the response to the war among Russians, join David Remnick to talk about the escalation of violence. Igor Novikov, a former adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tells Remnick how the President’s life as an actor and a comedian has given him an advantage in keeping the West’s attention. Plus: on the fiftieth anniversary of the release of “The Godfather,” Edie Falco reads from Pauline Kael’s review of the film. Kael noted how Francis Ford Coppola’s movie took the familiar outline of a gangster picture and imbued it with the “new, tragic realism” of its time.

It was a snowy morning. Stupak’s fingers were red with cold. Behind him, a local motorcycle club, in matching leather jackets, had brought a giant, Soviet-era mobile cooker.

If Gergiev had been giving stupendous concerts night after night, in the manner of Wilhelm Furtwängler in Nazi Germany, the support for him might have been understandable, though no less problematic. A Carnegie series in 2013, however, offered the dismal spectacle of an artist in both musical and moral decline. The fiery apostle of neglected Russian repertory who electrified the music world in the nineteen-nineties had given way to an overworked celebrity conductor who routinely produced shoddy performances. At “The Flying Dutchman,” in 2020, he seemed disengaged, even bored. Some other factor, apparently, was sustaining his allure. Perhaps it was money; contributions from entities such as Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy company, tended to materialize in his vicinity. Perhaps it was the lingering aura of a once formidable reputation. Once the dubious honorific “Maestro” is affixed, it is impossible to remove."

Is it a new form of citizen war journalism or just an invitation to keep clicking?
Hicks’s picture, of course, is an example of traditional photojournalism—a war photographer capturing action at the front lines of battle in a carefully composed image printed in a newspaper. The video, which as of my last count had more than nine million likes, is user-generated content broadcast online, following the aesthetic norms of TikTok: choppy, decontextualized, with catchy pop music in the background. What stands out about coverage of the war in Ukraine so far is how thoroughly the latter category of content has permeated the collective consciousness, providing some of the earliest and most direct glimpses of the Russian invasion. The Internet-focussed podcast “The Content Mines” called the Ukraine invasion “The Most Online War of All Time Until the Next One.” Other publications have dubbed it the “first TikTok war.”"

Mikhail Fishman, who hosts a Friday-night news-analysis program, was in the studio with TV Rain’s editor-in-chief, Tikhon Dzyadko. Fishman had decided to help host the newscast because his colleagues had been working long shifts since last Thursday, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Fishman was offering some observations on the state of the war. “Vladimir Putin didn’t believe that the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian nation exist. . . . He started a war against Ukraine to prove his point, and he has proved the opposite.” Fishman then directed viewers to a quote from a Guardian column by the historian Yuval Noah Harari, who enumerated the stories of heroism and resolve that Ukrainians had racked up in just a few days: “The president who refused to flee the capital, telling the US that he needs ammunition, not a ride; the soldiers from Snake Island who told a Russian warship to ‘go fuck yourself’; the civilians who tried to stop Russian tanks by sitting in their path. This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”"

The conflict was notable for how much the public already knew about it. The Biden Administration proactively declassified intelligence about Russia’s intentions in Ukraine, as a means to both foil Putin’s false pretenses for starting the war and expose his real motivations: to restore mid-century Soviet order. Another thing was made clear early on: the U.S. would not be intervening. Ukraine isn’t in NATO. The U.S. and its allies, which have adopted a series of tough economic sanctions against Russia, have no treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, no matter how sympathetic the country’s predicament might be. Whatever kind of spitball spin Fox News hosts and J. D. Vance have tried to put on things—stoking the idea that the White House is angling to send in ground troops—the Administration has said repeatedly that it won’t get involved militarily. Yes, there will be worthy endeavors, such as providing weapons, sharing intelligence, and assisting refugees, but our geopolitical might is mostly on hold for fear of conflict with a nuclear power. Crass as it may sound, the war in Ukraine is, for Americans, more of a media experience than anything else. Mostly what we will do is watch."

The G.O.P.’s parliamentary maneuver was an almost unheard of act of obstruction. Its aim was to deprive the Senate committee, which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, of the quorum necessary for a vote on Biden’s nominees to take place. The Republicans’ goal was to block a single nominee: Sarah Bloom Raskin, Biden’s pick for vice-chair for supervision. Had they met to vote as scheduled, her nomination would likely have survived a party-line tie, which under the Senate’s current rules would have advanced it to the Senate floor for the full body’s consideration. Instead, after the twelve Republicans on the committee failed to show up, the meeting adjourned, and the Senate soon after went into recess. This left not just Bloom Raskin but all five of Biden’s top nominees for the Fed in limbo, including Powell."

It is true that Europe has not seen this scale of conflict for some time; it is also true that some of the most brutal warfare in history has occurred on the European continent and continues to happen elsewhere in the world. But as hundreds of thousands of displaced Ukrainians seek refuge with their neighbors, migration policies previously hardened by European leaders against refugees from the Middle East and Africa are rapidly changing. Borders seem to be, for a time, miraculously open. As migrants continue to leave Afghanistan and other places caught up in American and European foreign policy, will the war in Ukraine mean anything for Europe’s other refugee crisis—for the refugees who are not white, possibly not Christian, but who are also in need?"

The problem for President Biden during his first State of the Union address, on Tuesday night, was not that the nation was in crisis but that there were so many of them. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. Inflation. The COVID pandemic. Gun violence. Cancer. The country’s fraying democracy. He seemed to mention all in the course of his address—which clocked in at an hour and two minutes—without necessarily making a particularly strong argument for what he would do about any of them.
In a House chamber filled with the bright blues and yellows of the Ukrainian flag, worn in solidarity with that embattled nation, the President offered some of the toughest language Americans have heard about the Russian dictator, whose unprovoked war on his neighbor is the largest conflict in Europe in decades. Putin was “menacing,” a liar whose “premeditated and unprovoked” invasion would be met with democratic resolve. Recalling the horrors of the last century, Biden sternly noted that, “when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos.”"

Occasionally in Moscow, you might see a clump of police officers in riot gear and a prisoner bus parked on the side of the road, its engine off—which means that the people inside are getting very cold as the bus slowly fills up. In the center of town, police buses have been parked for days, apparently on reserve in case of a larger operation. OVDInfo, an organization that tracks political persecution, has documented about sixty-four hundred detentions since Thursday, in more than a hundred cities.

If Putin was indeed calculating along these lines, he was gravely mistaken. On Saturday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced that the E.U.—in coöperation with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada—was taking steps to “cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.” The transatlantic allies moved to bar “selected Russian banks” from the global SWIFT messaging system, which financial institutions use to facilitate cross-border transfers of money. And, in a more surprising step, they also announced that they would impose “restrictive measures” on the Central Bank of Russia, with the explicit aim of preventing it from using its large stock of foreign-exchange reserves to lessen the impact of the sanctions. “This will show that Russia’s supposed sanctions-proofing of its economy is a myth,” a senior official in the Biden Administration said, in a teleconference with reporters. “The six-hundred-billion-plus war chest of Russia’s foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it.” The measures the allies announced were designed to block Moscow’s Central Bank from buying rubles from Western financial institutions, a step that could offset the impact of sanctions and stabilize the Russian currency. “The ruble will fall even further, inflation will spike, and the Central Bank will be left defenseless,” the U.S. official predicted."

One of the most striking protests was in Georgia, where thousands turned out in front of Parliament, in Tbilisi, to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili after he refused to join the global move to sanction Putin’s regime. The anger has even hit the vodka market in the United States, with bars pulling Russian brands off shelves and the governors of Ohio and New Hampshire banning their sale.

Kyiv was hit with missile and rocket strikes from the very start of Russia’s invasion, on February 24th; that same day, Russian paratroopers tried to capture a military airfield just outside city limits—an attack that was initially successful, then repelled, and then, if reports are to be believed, ultimately decisive. The northern suburbs have seen ongoing gun battles. It is clear that Russia’s invasion has little to do with the unresolved war in the Donbass, which had been seen as an obvious pretext, and is instead focussed on regime change. To remove Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, and install a pliant, pro-Russia replacement, however, requires taking the capital."

President Biden said the right things. The expected things. His words were blunt and unequivocal. On Thursday, hours after Vladimir Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine had begun, the American President stepped into the East Room of the White House and condemned Putin for his “sinister vision,” his “naked aggression,” and his evil, unprovoked war of choice. He called him a bully and a liar and a tyrant. He vowed to make Putin and his outlaw Russian regime a “pariah on the international stage.” He announced sanctions that he claimed “exceed anything that’s ever been done.” But what words, really, could be equal to this moment, to this day when Europe faces what may be the most dangerous and consequential war on the continent since the Second World War?
As Biden spoke, Ukraine was fighting—alone—against overwhelming military odds. There was a pitched battle in the nuclear hellscape that the Soviet Union left behind in Chernobyl. In Kyiv, air-raid sirens sounded for what must have been the first time since the Second World War, and a military official warned that the Russians’ goal was to quickly encircle the capital and decapitate the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Across the country, there were thousands of men, women, and children cowering in subway stations and makeshift shelters, clutching their iPhones and wondering how their twenty-first-century lives had turned overnight into a replay of twentieth-century horrors."

He charged that Putin “has much larger ambitions than Ukraine.” “He wants to, in fact, reëstablish the former Soviet Union,” Biden said. “His ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.” In one of a flurry of statements reflecting outrage globally, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, called Russia’s act “barbaric” and dismissed its justifications as “cynical.” In a tweet, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said he was appalled by Putin’s “horrific” decision to pursue “a path of bloodshed and destruction.” Putin’s military offensive put him on the diplomatic defensive.
