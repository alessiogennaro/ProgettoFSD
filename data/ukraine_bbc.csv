Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Investigators have been searching for evidence of alleged Russian war crimes, in apartment blocks in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians.Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
The losses caused by the Russian occupation - now ended - are put at more than 1.6bn hryvnia (£44m; $54m).
The explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl spread radiation across Europe in 1986.
The decommissioned plant, north of Kyiv, lies near the Belarus border and was quickly occupied by Russian troops after their 24 February invasion.
Russian forces controlled the plant for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March.
A team from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has just ended a visit to Chernobyl and its surrounding 2,700sq km (1,040sq mile) exclusion zone.
An IAEA statement says they ""provided support to their Ukrainian counterparts on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security"".
Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate has confirmed to the BBC that the Chernobyl site's radiation level is currently safe.
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.
In April the agency said the Russians had plundered two labs at Chernobyl, stealing sources of ionising radiation.
Mr Medved told the BBC that Russian soldiers had stolen ""computer monitors, hard drives and software"". ""We're still checking the losses... [it's] more than 1,000 units, and whatever they didn't steal they broke.""
Some removed spare wheels from their armoured personnel carriers so that they could carry away more looted equipment, he said. Construction and firefighting vehicles were stolen, he said, without giving a figure.
The Russian military has also been accused of looting elsewhere in Ukraine, but has not commented on the reports. It denies indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas.
Chernobyl acting director-general Valeriy Seyda says the plant's losses amount to more than 1.6bn hryvnia. He says operations have resumed there safely. The staff, with help from the IAEA, have to monitor the dormant reactors closely and run scientific tests.
The Russian troops smashed up and looted Chernobyl's workshops, labs and offices, Mr Seyda said.
Their negligence of safety rules, he said, ""caused some deterioration in [the] radiation situation"" which, he added, has been mitigated.
Ukraine has now de-mined the area and disposed of ammunition left behind, Mr Seyda said. Repairs have begun on the damaged facilities, he said, but it is now urgent to ensure safe operations for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.
Mr Medved said staff living in Slavutych, a town near the site, had previously commuted easily by train. ""But now the bridges are blown, there is no direct route, they have to go by bus via Kyiv.""
And he said the whereabouts of 196 Ukrainian soldiers taken prisoner by the Russians at Chernobyl were still unknown.
Ukraine now has eight reactors connected to the grid - two at the Zaporizhzhia power station, which is under Russian occupation, three at Rivne, two at the South Ukraine power station and one at Khmelnytskyy. Its seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve.Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
The losses caused by the Russian occupation - now ended - are put at more than 1.6bn hryvnia (£44m; $54m).
The explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl spread radiation across Europe in 1986.
The decommissioned plant, north of Kyiv, lies near the Belarus border and was quickly occupied by Russian troops after their 24 February invasion.
Russian forces controlled the plant for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March.
A team from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has just ended a visit to Chernobyl and its surrounding 2,700sq km (1,040sq mile) exclusion zone.
An IAEA statement says they ""provided support to their Ukrainian counterparts on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security"".
Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate has confirmed to the BBC that the Chernobyl site's radiation level is currently safe.
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

A plume of smoke a few kilometres away confirms the hit - another rocket.

These farewells have become a familiar sight across Ukraine over the last 100 days, but they are no less heartbreaking to watch.
Liudmyla has decided it is time for her youngest children to leave. She can't let them play outside as the bombardment continues and she wants them to be somewhere safe.
She holds on to them as long as she can, one under each arm, until it is time to go. Then it is too much. She turns her back and sobs as they leave.
""I will see them again when the bombing stops,"" she tells me. But no-one knows when that will be.
Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces came close to the city limits but were pushed back.
This region is key to Russian's strategy to cut off the entire southern coast. A breakthrough here would allow the Kremlin's forces to approach Odesa - the country's largest civilian port, 130 km (80 miles) to the west.
Vladimir Putin could then complete his land bridge up to Transnistria, the breakaway republic of Moldova.
Russian attacks have stepped up in recent weeks, prompting fears that if the Kremlin prevails in Donbas, it will then concentrate its forces in the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv.
The city governor, Vitaliy Kim, tells me that the recent air attacks in the south have been aimed at Ukrainian counter-offensives.
""Mykoliav, like Kherson, like Mariupol, is a trigger point for the Russians,"" he said.
""They are disappointed that we are counter-attacking. We have the motivation and the will to win. This is our land and we will do our best.""
He is standing outside his former office, the regional administration building, which was ripped apart by a cruise missile in March, killing 36 people.
Earlier this week, two people were killed when the Russians shelled an apartment block and a playground.
Mr Kim is aware of the risks of staying. ""I don't know what it is any more to live a normal life. I wish very much to end the war but I can't.
""For now, we have only one purpose. And everything, every human resource, money, time is spent only for victory.""
This city has proved to be remarkably resilient.
Water is a precious resource - supplies were cut off after Russia seized the neighbouring city of Kherson. Queues to fill bottles are often long and June temperatures are hitting around 30C.
And yet people here have managed to find a way to make it work. They fill up their containers from local stations set up in neighbourhoods.
The daily thud of incoming shells barely registers. Most hardly look up from their coffee as they sit on benches in the park. There is even a horse and Cinderella-like carriage with courting couples merrily trundling up and down the High Street.
This may be a Kremlin target, but it is also home.
We head 30 km (19 miles) south to a village near the frontline to see the path of Russia's retreat in March.
Dozens of families have returned since the invading forces were pushed back. The village head, Natalia Panashii, is keen to show me what they've done with the bomb craters.
""Look, I've turned them into flower beds,"" she tells me proudly.
""Thank God, we are holding on. Sometimes I am very scared that they might just kidnap me and take me away. On the other hand, I am sure, and I keep telling this to everyone else, that they have no business here. They should know better than loitering on our land.""
""Yes, we are concerned that the Russians might go on an offensive, very concerned. But we believe that the victory is going to be ours.""
We hear what I am told are cluster bombs being launched just a few kilometres away, so I question Natalia's optimism.
""Yes, even with that thumping,"" she said.
""We think that those thuds are just because some drunk Russian is firing to scare us. But he is failing at that.""
Natalia has lived for the last 100 days in both defiance and dread.
She admits to me that she will sit down and have a cry when I leave.
It makes me want to sit with her a little longer, but she waves me off with some Ukrainian biscuits.
As I head to the car, I notice the roads surrounding the village are still marked by the tracks of Russian tanks. Natalia points at them and shakes her head. ""No, no, no,"" she says.

On day 101 of the war, Ukraine said Russia was doing everything it could to take control of the key eastern city of Severodonetsk.
""The Russian army is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor.
The city has seen extremely fierce fighting in recent days as Russian troops try to take control of the entire Luhansk region - one of two regions which make up the part of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas.
Mr Haidai said earlier that Ukrainian forces had managed to retake some of Severodonetsk from Russian forces, adding that Russia had suffered huge losses.
The Russian bombardment of the city has been compared to the battle of Mariupol, which was all but destroyed by a relentless Russian assault.
The BBC's Joe Inwood explains why Severodonetsk has both a symbolic and military significance.
Elsewhere in the Donbas, fighting sparked a major fire at a famous wooden monastery - the Sviatohirsk Lavra Monastery in the Donetsk region.
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church said the flames had engulfed the monastery's main shrine.
""Another crime of Russian barbarians for whom there is nothing sacred,"" Ukrainian army officer, Yurii Kochevenko, said on Facebook.
A Ukrainian government tweet shows the fine old monastery intact, before it was hit.
Russia blamed Ukrainian ""nationalist"" troops for setting fire to the building. Read more about the monastery fire here.
Russia's focus on the Donbas does not mean the shelling has stopped in other parts of the country.
To the south, the important Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces were pushed back from the city limits.
But there is still shelling every day there, and if Russia accomplishes its goal of capturing the Donbas it could refocus its efforts to the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv.
Despite the constant danger, residents of the region remain defiant.
""Thank God, we are holding on... they [the Russians] should know better than loitering on our land,"" Natalia Panashii told the BBC's Laura Bicker on a recent visit.
You can read Laura's report from Mykolaiv here.
French President Emmanuel Macron landed himself in hot water with many Ukrainians on Saturday as he attempted to position France as a potential mediator in the war.
""We must not humiliate Russia,"" he told French media, so that ""when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means.""
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba quickly responded: ""Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it.
""It is Russia that humiliates itself.""
The war, particularly in the south, has had a devastating effect on Ukraine's ability to export food products from its Black Sea ports.
Kyiv and its allies say Moscow has imposed a naval blockade which prevents ships from operating in the region. Ukraine has also mined the coast to prevent a Russian amphibious assault.
The resulting shortage of products has driven up the price of staple foods like wheat around the world. That's why the head of the African Union, Macky Sall, has described African countries as innocent victims of the war.
More than 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine.
Mr Sall was visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
As he directs the fighting from the gleaming white halls of the Kremlin, what does Vladimir Putin make of the swirling Western debates over how best to support Ukraine, and the extent to which Russia should be punished?
In one corner, he sees governments in Britain, Poland and the Baltics calling for his unambiguous defeat.
""We need to make sure that Russia is driven out of Ukraine by the Ukrainians,"" the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week.
""There can't be any compromising over Ukrainian territory.""
But in the other corner, Mr Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach.
Speaking in early May, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, called for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and urged the West not to ""give in to the temptation of humiliation, nor the spirit of revenge"".
The following day, Italy's Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, speaking at the White House, said people in Europe wanted ""to think about the possibility of bringing a ceasefire and starting again some credible negotiations"".
After Mr Macron and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone call with Mr Putin on Saturday, aimed at exploring ways to enable Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, Latvia's deputy prime minister lashed out on social media.
""It seems that there are a number of so-called Western leaders who possess the explicit need for self-humiliation, in combination with a total detachment from political reality,"" Artis Pabriks tweeted.
Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin.
But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for regime change in Moscow, but also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
The former Prime Minister and President Dmitry Medvedev called that statement ""rational."" But the US decision announced on Wednesday to send a more advanced rocket system to Ukraine was described by the Kremlin as ""adding fuel to the fire"".
With the US president prone to speak off the cuff, it generally falls to his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, to deliver the administration's considered position.
At a recent Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin, Mr Blinken said the US and its partners were ""focussed on giving Ukraine as strong a hand as possible on the battlefield, and at any negotiating table, so that it can repel Russian aggression and fully defend its independence and sovereignty"".
Strong words, but how exactly do you define ""as strong a hand as possible""? And what does ""fully"" defending Ukraine's independence and sovereignty actually mean?
So are cracks beginning to break up the veneer of Western consensus on Ukraine?
""You only have to look at the struggle to get the oil embargo,"" says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform, referring to the tortured weeks of negotiation that resulted in this week's partial EU embargo on Russian oil.
Any notion that the EU will move swiftly on to Russian gas has already been dispelled. The Baltic states and Poland would like this to happen quickly, but Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, admitted this week that ""all the next sanctions will be more difficult"".
Austria's chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said a gas embargo ""will not be an issue in the next sanctions package"".
The West has promised much, Kyiv argues, but delivered less.
This week's American and German promises to supply advanced multiple rocket artillery and air defence and radar systems will certainly have gone some way towards meeting the urgent demands of hard-pressed Ukrainian commanders.
But allegations of German foot-dragging over previous commitments and Joe Biden's insistence that US weapons only be used to hit Russian targets inside Ukraine cause some to wonder why the West seeks to place limits on Ukraine's war effort while Russia observes no limits at all.
""There's a kind of calibration going on,"" says Ian Bond. ""As though we're saying 'we want the Ukrainians to win but not to win too much'"".
It's widely believed that Mr Putin launched this war confident that the West would lack the stomach for a fight. That Nato members, fresh from their humiliating exit from Afghanistan, would shy away from a new international imbroglio.
Some recent reports from Moscow suggest a creeping confidence, engendered by gradual battlefield success and the belief, in the words of one source quoted by the Meduza website, that ""sooner or later, Europe will tire of helping.""
The Kremlin may have taken heart from this week's British government warning that as many as six million British households could face power cuts if Russia shuts off gas supplies this winter.
Could public anger in the West undermine support for Ukraine?
It's a danger the US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, spelled out to members of Congress last month.
""He [Putin] is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,"" she told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ""as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.""
For all the anxieties about self-inflicted wounds and the hesitation surrounding the supply of weapons, the Western consensus over Ukraine remains remarkably intact.
But the cracks that exist could still widen.
""If either side begins to make decisive gains, then they become more of a problem,"" says Ian Bond.
""If the Russians completely break through Ukrainian lines in the east and start heading for the Dnieper River, the question of how much territory Ukraine should be willing to sacrifice to achieve a ceasefire is going to move up the agenda.""
By the same token, if Ukrainian forces start driving the Russians back, Ian Bond says, ""there will be voices in the West saying 'don't try and recapture parts of the Donbas that the Russians have controlled since 2014'.""
It's not a debate that seems terribly relevant just yet, but when the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger suggested at Davos that Ukraine should consider ceding territory in order to make peace with Russia, he met with a furious response in Ukraine and beyond.
A sign of anguished debates that still lie ahead.With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?

It's not a debate that seems terribly relevant just yet, but when the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger suggested at Davos that Ukraine should consider ceding territory in order to make peace with Russia, he met with a furious response in Ukraine and beyond.
A sign of anguished debates that still lie ahead."

African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering, the head of the African Union has told Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Russia.
After talks in Sochi, Macky Sall said the Russian leader had promised to ease the export of cereals and fertiliser, but gave no details.
Mr Putin denied Moscow was preventing Ukrainian ports from exporting grain.
Over 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine.
But Ukraine's ports in the Black Sea have been largely blocked for exports since the conflict began. Kyiv and its allies blame Moscow for blockading the ports, which Ukraine has mined to prevent a Russian amphibious assault.
""Failure to open those ports will result in famine,"" the UN's crisis coordinator Amin Awad said in Geneva.
He said a grain shortage could affect 1.4 billion people and trigger mass migration.
The war has exacerbated already existing shortages in Africa caused by bad harvests and insecurity.
Food prices have shot up across the continent since Russia invaded Ukraine 100 days ago, pushing huge numbers towards hunger.
The head of the World Food Programme, Mike Dunford, said more than 80 million people were acutely food insecure, acutely hungry in Africa - up from about 50 million people this time last year.
Chad has declared a national food emergency. A third of the population needs food aid, according to the UN and the government has appealed for international assistance.
Mr Sall, who is Senegal's president, told Mr Putin he should be ""aware that our countries, even if they are far from the theatre [of action], are victims of this economic crisis"".
He said he was also pleading on behalf of other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
Mr Putin said Russia was ready to guarantee the safe export of Ukrainian grain via ports on the Azov and Black seas it controls. He said the best solution would be to lift sanctions on Belarus, a close Russian ally, so the grain could be shipped that way.
Some analysts argue the Kremlin is hoping that a looming food crisis will put political pressure on the West by provoking big new refugee flows towards Europe from food-insecure countries in the Middle East and Africa.
Before Friday's meeting, Mr Putin said he was always on the side of Africa, but didn't explicitly mention the continent's food crisis.
Like many African countries, Senegal has avoided taking sides in the conflict and the Senegalese leader also said food supplies should be ""outside"" the West's sanctions on Russia. He said he had made this point when he spoke to the European Council earlier in the week.
Last Friday, US President Joe Biden dismissed the idea that the West bore responsibility for the global price rises.
""This is a Putin price hike. Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major bread baskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world,"" he said.African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering, the head of the African Union has told Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Russia.

It's been 98 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and events on the ground remain complex and fast-moving.
Moscow's forces have been pushed back from the capital city of Kyiv, and the troops dispatched by Vladimir Putin towards the second city of Kharkiv have been forced across the border back into Russia - but intense fighting continues.
Our correspondents on the ground have been answering your questions about how the war is progressing and whether Ukraine can survive the Russian onslaught. They are:
David Perdue, in Washington DC, asks: Has Russia's ground offensive practically stalled? What further Ukrainian territory will Russia look to occupy, if any?
After initial setbacks, Russian troops seem to be making gains in eastern Ukraine. But what's Moscow's objective? If Russia occupies the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, will the Kremlin stop or push on for more territory?
Even if Russia does call a halt, there's no guarantee it would be a permanent cessation of hostilities. They say a leopard doesn't change its spots… neither, I suspect, would Russia's president.
In speeches and articles Vladimir Putin has made it clear that he does not see Ukraine as a sovereign nation; instead he views it as a territory that belongs historically in Moscow's orbit.
After launching his ""special military operation"", the Kremlin leader seems to have expected the government in Kyiv to fall quickly. He even called on the Ukrainian military to rise up and overthrow the Ukrainian leadership. That didn't happen.
But that doesn't mean Vladimir Putin has given up on the idea of forcing Ukraine back into Moscow's sphere of influence - even in the face of Western sanctions.
This question comes from SC Bhargava: Why is it that Ukraine has been mostly defensive? Why has it not attacked military and civilian targets inside Russia?
This is a war Ukraine did not choose and did not start. It's defensive in its very nature: the country is fighting for its right to exist against an all-out Russian attack.
I don't think you can underestimate what it has cost Ukraine to stop Russia taking Kyiv, and now to try and halt the advance of Russian troops across the Donbas.
Openly and deliberately targeting Russia itself would be a major escalation at a time when Ukraine is battling to hold the line.
The pleas from Kyiv for more weapons from the West are constant. But the US recently made very clear that the longer-range missiles it will provide are not for hitting Russian territory: it fears an escalation.
Remember, the West judged it too risky to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine when Kyiv was begging for that at the start. As for Ukraine targeting Russian civilians? That would be a war crime.
Isobel McRae-Morris asks about reports that some Russian soldiers have been refusing to fight in Ukraine, with some conscripts deserting their positions. Is this really happening?
Yes, although it's hard to know the scale. The thing is, Russia hasn't officially declared war: Vladimir Putin insists on calling his invasion a ""special operation"" and that means professional soldiers can refuse to take part. They can be fired, but they can't - or shouldn't - be prosecuted.
Still, it takes some guts to actually do it. From my own reporting in Ukraine, I know that many of the Russian soldiers deployed at the start of this invasion were young and inexperienced; some didn't know they were going to war, others thought they'd take Kyiv in days, without resistance.
But the proof of heavy battles and heavy losses is everywhere, including in the refrigerated train carriages I've seen piled up with dead Russian soldiers. So it doesn't surprise me that some would refuse to fight, especially now they've seen for themselves that Ukraine doesn't want ""liberating"". But we're not seeing reports of mass desertion.
Philip Withers asks: Why has Nato not moved to protect the Black Sea port of Odesa, given that the Black Sea is international waters?
There are lots of complicated reasons for this.
Firstly, Nato is not directly involved in the conflict and wants to keep it that way.
Second, the Montreux Convention, which regulates maritime access to the Black Sea, gives Turkey a say over which non-Black Sea states are allowed to pass in and out through the Bosphorus.
Turkey has much closer relations with Moscow than almost all other Nato members (with the exception of Hungary) and wants to be seen as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. Any move to forcibly break Russia's blockade of Odesa would inevitably be seen by Moscow as a hostile move.
Britain and Lithuania recently indicated that they wanted to see a ""coalition of the willing"" to protect commercial shipping in and out of Odesa, in an effort to allow Ukraine to export its badly needed agricultural products, especially grain, around the world. But plans have yet to take shape.
In the meantime, a Danish decision to supply Ukraine with American-made Harpoon missiles, combined with Ukraine's own Neptune system (which was responsible for sinking the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet) mean that, for now, Odesa is not likely to be attacked from the sea.
The next question comes from reader Jayesh who asks whether Russia and Ukraine are holding any peace talks at the moment on establishing a ceasefire.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine started up soon after the Russian invasion. There were several rounds of negotiations, but they didn't produce any agreement.
For now, the talking's over. Both sides blame each other for that. But remember: if Russian forces hadn't attacked Ukraine in the first place, there'd be no need for a ceasefire!
It's likely that developments on the battlefield will dictate when, how and in what format negotiations resume.
This week, President Erdogan of Turkey talked by phone with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts and offered to mediate in the conflict.
Russia's current military aim appears to be to seize and occupy (or ""liberate"" as the Russians put it) the whole of the Donbas region. Moscow may not be ready for a ceasefire until it manages that.
One reader, Johnny, writes: When are countries going to stop acting scared of Russia and stand up to them?
Are Ukraine's Western backers scared or merely acting cautiously?
Some, like the Baltic republics, have voiced frustration over what they see as the West's reluctance to give Ukraine everything it needs.
But for all Russia's military deficiencies - which have been cruelly exposed over more than three months of a frequently bungled campaign - it is still armed with a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons which it has hinted it could use.
Western officials continue to believe that Moscow is unlikely to resort to such doomsday options, but they cannot simply act as if such dangers didn't exist.
And while some, including the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seem happy to talk about expelling Russian forces from the whole of Ukraine, others see a return to the situation that existed on the morning of 24 February as a more likely and feasible scenario.
This would leave Russia in control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, as well as significant chunks of the eastern Donbas.
Lois Barakat Ichelson says: In light of new EU oil embargoes, which will be tougher by the end of the year, are the oligarchs organised, powerful and motivated enough to oust President Putin?
He goes on to ask whether there are any other groups or forces in the country that could remove him.
Considering the highly secretive nature of Kremlin politics, it's only natural that there's lots of rumour and speculation about the man at the top; after all, it's Putin who takes all key decisions in the country.
So… is Vladimir Putin seriously ill? Are the knives being sharpened ahead of a ""palace coup""? Are the oligarchs plotting to overthrow the president?
Much of this, I suspect, is wishful thinking on the part of President Putin's detractors. Of course, not everyone in the corridors of Kremlin power will be happy with what Russia's doing in Ukraine and the international sanctions Moscow has brought upon itself.
But, right now, there's no hint of an anti-Putin coup - and that includes amongst the oligarchs, whose wings the Kremlin clipped long ago.
Mind you, if you were Vladimir Putin, would you be taking any chances? That may explain why the head of the Russian National Guard is an ex-Putin bodyguard.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61680382;2022-06-03;Ukraine lifts interest rate to highest in Europe;"Ukraine's central bank has more than doubled its interest rate to 25% to the highest level for any European country.
The move is intended to slow soaring inflation and prevent a further collapse of its currency following Russia's invasion in February.
Businesses have been forced to close and key supply chains have been cut off since the war began.
The World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy could shrink by as much as 45% this year.
The rate of inflation - or the cost of living - has risen to 17% in Ukraine and is on track to hit 20% this year, according to the country's central bank.
The National Bank of Ukraine said the benchmark interest rate increase - from 10% to 25% - would help protect citizens' savings from being eaten by soaring inflation.
Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has also come under heavy pressure since Russia's invasion, falling sharply in value. The central bank said it hoped the rate rise would ease some of that strain and stabilise the currency.
It is Ukraine's first rate increase since the war broke out, with the bank signalling it would move to reduce rates again once inflation was back under control.
More than $100bn of infrastructure damage to Ukrainian cities has been caused by artillery fire and airstrikes, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, while 14 million citizens have been forced to flee their homes.
To mount its military defence, and support citizens who have lost their livelihoods, the government has rapidly increased its spending, pushing the budget deficit up 27% month on month to $7.7bn in May, according to Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital.
Banks have also been forced to accept that loans made to businesses in territory now controlled by Russia will probably never be repaid, another huge financial blow to the country's economy.
""The most likely scenario is that nearly all corporate and retail loans in the territories that are still occupied will be lost,"" said Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, head of macro research at asset manager Investment Capital Ukraine.
Friday marks 100 days since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, with 4,500 civilians killed since fighting broke out. Hospitals and schools have been devastated, while ports have been blockaded, cutting Ukraine off from the exports that form the backbone of its economy.
Around 50% of the world's supply of neon gas, critical for making the microchips that power smartphones and cars, comes from just two Ukrainian companies.
In addition, more than 18% of global barley exports, 16% of corn, and 12% of wheat, come from Ukraine's fields.
""The food crisis really threatens up to 1.4 billion people that are going to experience food shortages and even famine in some places,"" Amin Awad, the UN crisis coordinator for Ukraine told the BBC's Today programme.
""The food is stranded in Ukraine. It produces 85 million tonnes of grain every year.""
With another large harvest coming up in July and August this year, Mr Awad warned that if grain silos - currently full with food - can't be cleared, crops would rot in the fields because there would be no place to store them.
Egypt, which prior to the war received around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is currently experiencing shortages, and warned that ""millions"" could die globally.
Meanwhile, in Turkey inflation surged to a 24-year high of 73.5% in the year to May, driven by the war in Ukraine, a weak currency and high energy prices.
Food costs have skyrocketed by 92% over the past year in Turkey, making basic goods unaffordable for many despite government interventions.Ukraine's central bank has more than doubled its interest rate to 25% to the highest level for any European country.

Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has also come under heavy pressure since Russia's invasion, falling sharply in value. The central bank said it hoped the rate rise would ease some of that strain and stabilise the currency.
It is Ukraine's first rate increase since the war broke out, with the bank signalling it would move to reduce rates again once inflation was back under control.
More than $100bn of infrastructure damage to Ukrainian cities has been caused by artillery fire and airstrikes, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, while 14 million citizens have been forced to flee their homes.
To mount its military defence, and support citizens who have lost their livelihoods, the government has rapidly increased its spending, pushing the budget deficit up 27% month on month to $7.7bn in May, according to Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital.
Banks have also been forced to accept that loans made to businesses in territory now controlled by Russia will probably never be repaid, another huge financial blow to the country's economy.
""The most likely scenario is that nearly all corporate and retail loans in the territories that are still occupied will be lost,"" said Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, head of macro research at asset manager Investment Capital Ukraine.
Friday marks 100 days since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, with 4,500 civilians killed since fighting broke out. Hospitals and schools have been devastated, while ports have been blockaded, cutting Ukraine off from the exports that form the backbone of its economy.
Around 50% of the world's supply of neon gas, critical for making the microchips that power smartphones and cars, comes from just two Ukrainian companies.
In addition, more than 18% of global barley exports, 16% of corn, and 12% of wheat, come from Ukraine's fields.
""The food crisis really threatens up to 1.4 billion people that are going to experience food shortages and even famine in some places,"" Amin Awad, the UN crisis coordinator for Ukraine told the BBC's Today programme.
""The food is stranded in Ukraine. It produces 85 million tonnes of grain every year.""
With another large harvest coming up in July and August this year, Mr Awad warned that if grain silos - currently full with food - can't be cleared, crops would rot in the fields because there would be no place to store them.
Egypt, which prior to the war received around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is currently experiencing shortages, and warned that ""millions"" could die globally.
Meanwhile, in Turkey inflation surged to a 24-year high of 73.5% in the year to May, driven by the war in Ukraine, a weak currency and high energy prices.
Food costs have skyrocketed by 92% over the past year in Turkey, making basic goods unaffordable for many despite government interventions."

Russia now appears to have the initiative over Ukraine in the battle for the Donbas, in the country's east, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said.
On the war's 100th day, the UK said Russia holds 90% of the Luhansk region - half of the Donbas - and is likely to complete control of it in two weeks.
It said these tactical successes had been achieved ""at significant resource cost"" with the concentration of forces.
But it said none of Russia's original war objectives had been achieved.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Moscow's forces are now in control of 20% of Ukrainian territory, with a front line that extends for more than 1,000 km (621 miles).
On Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Western nations must be prepared to support Ukraine over the long haul, as the conflict becomes a ""war of attrition"".
In its most recent count of civilian casualties on 2 June, the UN said it had recorded 4,169 deaths and 4,982 injuries - including 67 deaths of children.
But it said the true total was likely to be considerably higher as it has not yet been able to confirm deaths in some regions where the fighting is intense - such as Mariupol in southern Ukraine, where officials estimate 21,000 civilians have been killed.
Assessing the 100-day conflict so far, the UK's Defence Intelligence, part of the Ministry of Defence, said Moscow had failed in its initial objectives of seizing Ukraine's centres of government and the capital, Kyiv.
""Staunch Ukrainian resistance"" and the failure to secure Hostomel airfield near the capital during the first 24 hours led to the Russian assault being pushed back, the intelligence update said.
It also said Russian forces suffered from ""false planning assumptions"" and ""poor tactical execution"".
But since it changed its strategy to focus on the Donbas, the region in south-eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatist groups have been fighting for eight years, Moscow has begun ""achieving tactical success"", the UK said.
""Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition,"" the intelligence update said.
""Russia controls over 90% of Luhansk Oblast and is likely to complete control in the next two weeks.""
The UK intelligence assessment said Russia had not been able to ""generate momentum or movement"" on other fronts and is on the defensive in other parts of the conflict.

Wars ebb and flow. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is no exception.
Early fears of a swift conquest were succeeded by Russian retreat and Ukrainian resistance. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
Here are five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
The war might continue for months - if not years - as Russian and Ukrainian forces grind each other down.
Momentum shifts to and fro as both sides make gains and losses. Neither side is willing to give up. Russia's President Putin judges he can gain by demonstrating strategic patience, gambling that Western countries will suffer from ""Ukraine fatigue"" and focus more on their economic crises and the threat from China.
The West, however, shows resolve and continues to supply Ukraine with weapons. Semi-permanent front lines are established. Steadily the war becomes a frozen conflict, a ""forever war"".
Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general and military scholar, says: ""There is little prospect of a crushing operational or strategic victory by either side in the short term. Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow.""
What if President Putin were to surprise the world with a unilateral ceasefire? He could pocket his territorial gains and declare ""victory"".
He could claim his ""military operation"" was complete: Russian-backed separatists in Donbas protected; a land corridor to Crimea established. He could then seek the moral high ground, putting pressure on Ukraine to stop fighting.
""This is a ploy which could be used by Russia at any time, if it wants to capitalise on European pressure on Ukraine to surrender and give up territory in exchange for notional peace,"" says Keir Giles, Russia expert at the Chatham House think tank.
The arguments are heard already in Paris, Berlin and Rome: no need to prolong the war, time to end the global economic pain, let's push for a ceasefire.
This, though, would be opposed by the US, the UK and much of eastern Europe, where policymakers believe Russia's invasion must fail, for the sake of Ukraine and the international order.
So a unilateral Russian ceasefire might change the narrative but not end the fighting.
What if both Ukraine and Russia conclude they cannot achieve more militarily and enter talks for a political settlement?
Their armies are exhausted, running short of manpower and munitions. The price in blood and treasure no longer justifies further fighting. Russia's military and economic losses are not sustainable. The Ukrainian people tire of war, unwilling to risk more lives for an eternally elusive victory.
What if the leadership in Kyiv - no longer trusting continued Western support - decide the time has come to talk? US President Joe Biden openly admits America's aim is for Ukraine to be ""in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table"".
But there may not be a battlefield stalemate for many months and any political settlement would be hard, not least because of Ukraine's lack of trust in Russia. A peace deal might not endure and could be followed by more fighting.
Could Ukraine - against the odds - achieve something close to a victory? Could Ukraine force Russian troops to withdraw to where they were before the invasion?
""Ukraine will definitely win this war,"" the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky told Dutch TV this week.
What if Russia fails to seize all Donbas and suffers more losses? Western sanctions hit Russia's war machine. Ukraine makes counter attacks, using its new long-range rockets, seizing back territory where Russian supply lines are stretched. Ukraine transforms its army from a defensive to an offensive force.
This scenario is plausible enough for policymakers to worry already about its consequences. If Mr Putin were facing defeat, might he escalate, potentially using either chemical or nuclear weapons?
The historian Niall Ferguson told a seminar at Kings College, London recently: ""It seems unlikely to me that Putin is going to accept conventional military defeat when he has a nuclear option.""
And what of a possible Russian ""victory""?
Western officials emphasise that Russia, despite early setbacks, still plans to seize the capital Kyiv and subjugate much of Ukraine. ""Those maximalist objectives remain in place,"" one official said.
Russia could capitalise on its gains in Donbas, freeing up forces for use elsewhere, perhaps even targeting Kyiv once again. The sheer weight of Russian numbers come to bear. Ukrainian forces continue to suffer.
President Zelensky already admits up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying and another 500 are wounded every day.
The people of Ukraine could divide, some wanting to fight on, others wanting to sue for peace. Some Western countries might tire of supporting Ukraine. But equally, if they thought Russia was winning, others might want to escalate.

Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists. The BBC has been speaking to one such soldier.
""I don't want to go [back to Ukraine] to kill and be killed,"" says Sergey - not his real name - who spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year.
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. Sergey is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
Sergey says he is traumatised by his experience in Ukraine.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" says the young man bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
""We were like blind kittens. I'm shocked by our army. It wouldn't cost much to equip us. Why wasn't it done?""
Sergey joined the army as a conscript - most Russian men between the ages of 18-27 must complete one year of compulsory military service. But, after a few months, he made the decision to sign a two-year professional contract which would also give him a salary.
In January, Sergey was sent near the border with Ukraine for what he was told would be military drills. A month later - 24 February, the day Russia launched its invasion - he was told to cross the border. Almost immediately his unit found itself under attack.
As they stopped for the evening in an abandoned farm, their commander said: ""Well, as you will have worked out by now, this is not a joke.""
Sergey says he was completely shocked.
""My first thoughts were 'Is this really happening to me?'""
They were continually shelled, he says, both when moving and when parked overnight. In his unit of 50 people, 10 were killed and 10 others wounded. Almost all his comrades were under the age of 25.
He heard of Russian servicemen so inexperienced that they ""did not know how to shoot and couldn't tell one end of a mortar from another"".
He says his convoy - travelling through northern Ukraine - broke up after just four days when a bridge they were about to cross exploded, killing comrades ahead of them.
In another incident, Sergey says he had to overtake comrades trapped inside a burning vehicle in front of him.
""It was blown up from a grenade launcher or something else. It caught fire and there were [Russian] soldiers inside. We drove around it and on, firing as we went. I didn't look back.""
His unit moved on through the Ukrainian countryside, but there was a clear lack of strategy, he says. Reinforcements failed to arrive and soldiers were poorly equipped for the task of taking a large city.
""We went without helicopters - just in a column, as though we were heading to a parade.""
He believes his commanders had planned to capture strongholds and key cities very quickly - and had calculated that the Ukrainians would simply surrender.
""We rushed forward with short overnight stays, without trenches, without reconnaissance. We didn't leave anyone in the rear, so if someone decided to come in from behind and hit us there was no protection.
""I think that [so many of] our guys died largely because of this. If we had moved gradually, if we had checked the roads for mines many losses could have been avoided.""
Sergey's complaints about lack of equipment have also emerged in phone conversations alleged to be between Russian soldiers and their families, intercepted and posted online by the Ukrainian security services.
At the beginning of April, Sergey was sent back over the border to a camp on the Russian side. Troops had been withdrawn from northern Ukraine and appeared to be regrouping for an assault in the east. Later that month he received an order to return to Ukraine - but told his commander that he was not prepared to go.
""He said it was my choice. They didn't even [try to] dissuade us, because we weren't the first,"" Sergey told the BBC. But, he had been sufficiently worried about his unit's reaction to his refusal that he decided to seek legal advice.
A lawyer told Sergey and two like-minded colleagues to return their arms and go back to their unit's headquarters - where they should file a letter explaining that they were ""morally and psychologically exhausted"" and could not continue fighting in Ukraine.
Sergey was told that returning to the unit was important because simply leaving could be interpreted as desertion, which can result in a two-year sentence in a disciplinary battalion.
Army commanders try to intimidate contract soldiers into staying with their units, according to Russian human rights lawyer Alexei Tabalov. But he stresses that Russian military law does include clauses which allow soldiers to refuse to fight if they don't want to.
Human rights activist Sergei Krivenko says he is not aware of any prosecutions of those refusing to return to the front.
That is not to say that prosecutions are not being attempted.
One commander in northern Russia requested a criminal case be brought against his subordinate who would not return to Ukraine, but a military prosecutor refused to proceed, according to documents seen by the BBC. Such an action would be ""premature"" without having assessed the harm to the military service he was involved in, the prosecutor said.
And there is no guarantee that more prosecutions might not emerge in the future.
Soldiers like Sergey - reluctant to return to the front line - are not unusual, according to Ruslan Leviev, the editor of Conflict Intelligence Team, a media project investigating the experiences of the Russian military in Ukraine through confidential interviews and open source material.
Leviev says his team estimates a sizeable minority of the Russian contract soldiers sent to Ukraine to fight in the initial invasion refused to go back again.
Independent Russian media have also been reporting hundreds of cases of soldiers refusing repeat deployments to Ukraine since the beginning of April.
Several lawyers and human rights activists the BBC spoke to said they had been regularly offering advice to men trying to avoid returning to Ukraine. Each of our interviewees had dealt with dozens of cases and believed those soldiers were also sharing advice with their colleagues.
Although Sergey does not want to return to the front line, he does want to complete his outstanding military service in Russia to avoid any unforeseen consequences. But that means that - while his letter of refusal to fight was accepted - there are no guarantees he won't be sent back to Ukraine during his service period.

Russian forces have been intensifying attacks around the eastern city of Severodonets on the 99th day of Moscow's invasion.
The last major centre held by Ukraine in the Donbas region is under attack from ""from all directions"", Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said, adding that intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations.
Some 15,000 civilians reportedly remain trapped there.
UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of Severodonetsk and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"".
But Mr Haidai insisted that Ukrainian troops had been carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".
With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
In one corner, governments in the UK, Poland and the Baltic states have been consistent in calling for Russia's unambiguous defeat.
But in the other corner, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach.
Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin.
But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Mr Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for a change in leadership in Moscow, he was also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
Russian-imposed authorities in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region have said the Ukrainian state's property and resources in the area will be ""nationalised"".
Andrei Trofimov, deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, said a decree had been signed for the nationalisation of Ukrainian property, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
Mr Trofimov said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February - the day Russia launched its invasion of the country.
""The decree was signed in order to meet state needs related to improving the overall efficiency and social orientation of the economy, as well as to preserve the national heritage for residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region,"" he said.

But Mr Haidai insisted that Ukrainian troops had been carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".
With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
In one corner, governments in the UK, Poland and the Baltic states have been consistent in calling for Russia's unambiguous defeat.
But in the other corner, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach.
Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin.
But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Mr Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for a change in leadership in Moscow, he was also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
Russian-imposed authorities in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region have said the Ukrainian state's property and resources in the area will be ""nationalised"".
Andrei Trofimov, deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, said a decree had been signed for the nationalisation of Ukrainian property, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
Mr Trofimov said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February - the day Russia launched its invasion of the country.
""The decree was signed in order to meet state needs related to improving the overall efficiency and social orientation of the economy, as well as to preserve the national heritage for residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region,"" he said.

A refugee from Severodonetsk whose home was bombed in Russian air strikes says people in the UK city of Nottingham have made her feel welcome.
Lina Udodenko, who used to have a job supporting refugees, is being hosted in Nottingham through the Ukrainian Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine).
The 26-year-old said she had found out this week that her home had been destroyed after seeing a video on Facebook of her city.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Russian forces have seized 20% of his country's territory, as Moscow's invasion nears its 100th day.
Addressing lawmakers in Luxembourg, he added that the front line extended for more than 1,000km (621 miles).
""All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression,"" he told MPs via videolink.
Russian forces have been intensifying attacks on the city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region.
UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of the city and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"".
Severodonetsk is the easternmost city under Ukrainian control and regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia was trying to break through defences in the city ""from all directions"".
However he said Ukrainian troops were carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".
Intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations, he said, describing such efforts as ""extremely dangerous"".
In a video address late on Thursday evening, Mr Zelensky said the situation in Donbas had not changed significantly that day but that Ukrainians had experienced ""some success"" in battles in Severodonetsk.
Some 15,000 civilians remain trapped in the city, with many of them taking shelter at the massive Azot chemical plant.
On Wednesday, Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops allegedly targeted the site during an artillery barrage.
Further south, the mayor of the occupied city of Mariupol has accused Russian forces of executing civil servants who have refused to collaborate with the new Moscow-backed city authority.
Vadym Boychenko, who was evacuated from Mariupol before it fell, said dozens of residents were being held at the Olenivka Prison and that he had received reports of locals being tortured by occupying forces. The BBC cannot verify these allegations.
Last week an adviser to Mr Boychenko told CNN that at least 22,000 people had been killed during Russia's siege and bombardment of the city.
In the north-east, Russian shelling killed a woman and injured a man in Kharkiv, regional officials said.
And in western Ukraine five civilians were hurt in missile strikes on Lviv, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said.
Western leaders are also stepping up sanctions against key allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
US Treasury Department officials unveiled a new raft of sanctions on Thursday, with targets including several yachts allegedly linked to Mr Putin and a cellist who allegedly acts as a middleman for the Russian leader.
US officials will seek to seize two vessels, the Russian-flagged Graceful and the Cayman islands-flagged Olympia, which were identified as personal assets of Mr Putin.
The cellist, Sergei Roldugin, is allegedly a custodian of the Russian president's offshore wealth.
Five oligarchs with links to Mr Putin as well as Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova will also have any US assets frozen and are barred from doing business with US-based corporations.
EU diplomats are said to have finalised a sixth package of sanctions against Moscow.
The sanctions, which include a limited ban on Russian oil imports, were reportedly agreed after officials accepted a Hungarian request to remove the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from the list of targets.
The president of the European Parliament also announced a ban on Russian lobbyists entering the chamber's campus.
Roberta Metsola wrote on Twitter that she was keen to deprive Moscow's representatives of the ability ""to spread their propaganda & false, toxic narratives about the invasion of Ukraine"".
On Wednesday President Joe Biden announced that the US would supply Ukraine with new long-range missiles capable of hitting targets at distances of up to 70km (45 miles).
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the US and its allies of intentionally prolonging the war and of ""adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Russian forces have seized 20% of his country's territory, as Moscow's invasion nears its 100th day.

A small number of free tickets to the Wales-Ukraine World Cup play-off final will be given to Ukrainian refugees.
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Welsh government are in discussions on how many will be made available for Sunday's game.
Home tickets at the 33,000-capacity Cardiff City Stadium have sold out.
The FAW has also invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the game, and a welcome message will be waiting for the visiting team at Cardiff Airport.
The Welsh government is believed to be helping the FAW identify refugees who have fled the conflict in Ukraine.
Ukraine qualified for the play-off final on Wednesday by beating Scotland 3-1. Now they will play Wales, with the winners earning a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Wales are hoping to qualify for the tournament for the first time since 1958, while Ukraine qualified for their first and only World Cup in 2006.
The Ukrainian FA has been allocated 5% of matchday tickets, with those expected to go on sale in the coming days.
It's thought a small number of tickets for refugees will be made available in addition to the standard visiting allocation.
Ukrainians Svitlana Phillips and Maryna Farrell, who were living in Wales before the conflict began, had called on the FAW to give those fleeing the war with Russia the chance to see the game.
Ms Phillips, a Ukrainian who has lived in Swansea for 20 years and is married a Welshman, said it would be a ""fantastic"" thing to do.
She said: ""For the last few years, people in Wales have shown such generosity to the people of Ukraine.
""So I wouldn't be surprised if it comes to that, and there would be some tickets given away and Ukrainians can come and join and celebrate and have a cheerful day.""
Ms Farrell, originally from Lutsk, moved to Wales 14 years ago. She was visiting family in Ukraine when the Russians invaded
""I've had probably about seven phone calls this morning trying to figure out ways of getting to the match,"" she said.
""I know that Cardiff City and the FAW have been very supportive in the past, so I'm really hoping there's something that can be done.
""There is a lot of people who have already come to Wales who would absolutely love to be part of the game on Sunday. I know it will be a very emotional time for them, but it will be an unforgettable moment.
""It would be a great distraction for everyone.""
She has lived in Wales for 14 years, but will be supporting Ukraine.
""Having lived in Wales for so long I do consider myself Ukrainian-Welsh; however my roots are still in Ukraine,"" she said.
Ms Phillips said she and her husband were going to have to fight to decide whether a Ukrainian or Welsh flag would be erected.
She said: ""I am sure that Ukrainian people will be singing the Welsh anthem, and Welsh people will be singing the Ukrainian anthem, in support of recent events and in celebration of togetherness of what we have been through.
""Welsh people in the last three months have shown absolutely incredible generosity supporting Ukraine.
""So obviously it is very important for everybody around the world, what is going on in Ukraine, but at such an event like a football game I think it is going to bring people together, unite even more.""
Meanwhile, Welsh fans in Poland have raised money for Ukrainian refugees who became stuck there after Russia's invasion.
Wales lost 2-1 in Wroclaw on Wednesday in the Nations League.
Twenty young Ukrainian footballers went there for a football tournament in February, but were never able to go home.
The visiting supporters raised about 5,000 zloty (£930) to help support the refugees.
The Notice Me foundation, a charity which usually works with children with cancer, has been looking after the young footballers.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, fan Tim Hartley, who went to the match, said: ""This is just our little thank you to the people of Poland, a little something for the children of Ukraine.
""To say we really do support you, it was great to see everybody, we raffled a shirt, we had a sing-song, we raised money. It was great to see the Welsh fans supporting the charity.""
The children are slowly being joined by their mothers and their siblings, and the charity has been building a shelter for 200 children and women who are escaping the war.
It is hoped the ""Ukrainian House"" will help the children forget about the war, and will make them feel at home in Poland.
The charity has been building bathrooms and kitchens, bedrooms and lounges. There will also be classrooms and a kindergarten for the younger children.

A lorry used to help evacuate civilians and deliver aid from Gloucester to Ukraine has been hit in an attack that killed a French journalist.
The 11-year-old silver Mercedes truck was attacked by Russian forces while evacuating civilians; despite being labelled a humanitarian aid vehicle.
A Ukrainian foreign ministry official said it was hit on Monday near the city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine.
The truck had also been delivering baby food and medical equipment out there.
Gloucester City Councillor Alastair Chambers, one of the volunteers who helped organise the relief effort, told the Local Democracy Reporting service (LDRS) he was shocked to see pictures of the attack.
He said: ""The lorry was picked up from Preston Fleet Services and then we drove it to Gloucester to fill it up with humanitarian aid.
""Baby stuff, things for elderly people, food and equipment.

More than 50 lightweight baby incubators, partly funded by Jersey Overseas Aid (JOA), are being sent to Ukraine after a rise in the number of premature births in the war-torn country.
Developed by British start-up company mOm, the incubators weigh only 44lbs (20kg) compared to traditional incubators which could weigh up to 220lbs (100kg), project leaders said.
They could also be used immediately by clinicians, without lengthy set-up or training times, they added.
Fifty-one incubators were going to hospitals across the country, with the first tranche being delivered on Tuesday, JOA said.
The equipment is being overseen by international development not-for-profit organisation Crown Agents.
It said the units could run off “multiple power sources, with a back-up battery, which will be vital as Ukraine continues to face power outages”.
It said it had heard reports that the stress of the war was “having a negative effect on pregnant women with doctors seeing a sharp rise in premature births”.
It added: “Incubators are vital for saving the lives of these premature babies, ensuring they remain at a safe, stable temperature.""
Douglas Melville, of JOA, said the “robust and easy-to-use incubators will undoubtedly save innocent lives”.
In March, prenatal clinics in both Kharkiv and Lviv told the BBC that the rate of preterm births had doubled or tripled, as a result of stress and medical issues linked to the war.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659;2022-05-31;What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
In its latest attempt to punish Russia for it invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is to ban all imports of oil from Russia that are brought in by sea.
It says this could cut the amount of oil that EU countries import from Russia by up to 90%, reducing the amount of money the Russian government makes from oil sales.
The EU, along with countries such as the UK and the US, have introduced a series of measures to weaken key areas of the Russian economy, such as its energy and financial sectors.
Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop it acting aggressively, or breaking international law.
They are among the toughest actions nations can take, short of going to war.
Up until now, EU states have been importing 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia and 1.2 million bpd of oil products.
Given the soaring price of oil, this has been earning Russia over $1m (£800,000) a day.
EU nations have agreed to stop importing any oil from Russia that comes in by sea, which rules out about two-thirds of the total.
They will continue, on a temporary basis, to import Russian oil by pipeline. This is to benefit countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which are highly dependent on it.
However, Germany and Poland, which also import Russian oil by pipeline, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year.
The EU's president, Ursula von der Leyen, says this will effectively reduce the EU's oil imports from Russia to 10 or 11% of its current level.
The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.
Germany has frozen plans for the opening of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
The EU has also said it will halt Russian coal imports by August.
However, the EU is less keen to impose sanctions on Russian gas, because it relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs.
In March, the EU committed to reducing gas imports by two-thirds within a year but has not been able to agree any further action.
Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions - targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises.
Financial measures
Russia's central bank assets have been frozen to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves.
This caused the rouble to fall 22% in value, pushing up the price of imported goods and leading  Russia's inflation rate to rise to 14%. The rouble has since recovered, mainly due to measures by Moscow to prop it up, but inflation has risen above 17%.
The United States has barred Russia from making debt payments using the $600m it holds in US banks, making it harder for Russia to repay its international loans.
Major Russian banks have been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift, which will delay payments to Russia for energy exports.
The UK has excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks,
Targeting individuals
The US, EU, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including:
The UK has also stopped the sale of ""golden visas"", which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights.
More than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Marks & Spencer.
McDonald's is leaving Russia and selling off its 850 restaurants, 30 years after setting up there.
Food giant Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik, but will still sell ""essential foods"".
However, some brands including Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they can't pull out because their businesses operate under complex franchise deals.
Military goods and mercenaries
A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose, such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK, EU and US.
The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russia's Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military.
Flights
All Russian flights have been banned from US, UK, EU and Canadian airspace.
The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians.
Luxury goods
The UK and the EU have banned the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles, high-end fashion and art.
The  UK has also imposed a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka.
Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022, including telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment and timber.
In addition, it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds, and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders.
And it has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them.In its latest attempt to punish Russia for it invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is to ban all imports of oil from Russia that are brought in by sea.

This caused the rouble to fall 22% in value, pushing up the price of imported goods and leading  Russia's inflation rate to rise to 14%. The rouble has since recovered, mainly due to measures by Moscow to prop it up, but inflation has risen above 17%.
The United States has barred Russia from making debt payments using the $600m it holds in US banks, making it harder for Russia to repay its international loans.
Major Russian banks have been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift, which will delay payments to Russia for energy exports.
The UK has excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks,
Targeting individuals
The US, EU, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including:
The UK has also stopped the sale of ""golden visas"", which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights.
More than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Marks & Spencer.
McDonald's is leaving Russia and selling off its 850 restaurants, 30 years after setting up there.
Food giant Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik, but will still sell ""essential foods"".
However, some brands including Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they can't pull out because their businesses operate under complex franchise deals.
Military goods and mercenaries
A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose, such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK, EU and US.
The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russia's Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military.
Flights
All Russian flights have been banned from US, UK, EU and Canadian airspace.
The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians.
Luxury goods
The UK and the EU have banned the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles, high-end fashion and art.
The  UK has also imposed a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka.
Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022, including telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment and timber.
In addition, it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds, and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders.
And it has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them."

Russia has accused the US of intentionally prolonging the war in Ukraine after President Joe Biden announced that his administration would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles in the coming weeks.
Writing in the New York Times, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Ukraine's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused the US of aiming to ""fight Russia to the last Ukrainian"" and said the move discouraged officials in Kyiv from seeking a compromise to end the conflict.
President Biden said the weapons, which Ukraine has long asked for, are to help strike enemy forces within Ukraine more precisely and from a longer distance.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine had promised not to use the new missiles to strike inside Russia, and warned of a long conflict ahead.
The intervention comes as fighting intensifies in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has been accused of ""madness"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky after striking a chemical factory in the city.
More graphic accounts of torture have emerged from Ukraine at the hands of Russian soldiers - this time from Kherson in the south of the country.
An unnamed doctor describes signs of ""body mutilation"" providing a list that includes cuts and burns, electrocution, binding and strangulation.
One man, Olexander, says a bag was put on his head and rope was tied around his neck and wrists. He says he was then beaten and threatened.
The BBC's Caroline Davies has heard multiple first-hand testimonies saying that people began to disappear when Russian troops took control of Kherson.
Earlier, three of our correspondents spent some time answering questions sent in by members of the public about the war.
Life away from the front line can seem relatively normal, says BBC Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Rainsford. But she describes the whole of Ukraine as sitting on ""a fear spectrum"" with some civilians being scared into leaving the country.
Peace talks aren't a likely option right now, says the BBC's Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. He told a reader talking is over between both sides and each blame each other - and developments on the battlefield will dictate what happens next with negotiations.

Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 allegations of war crimes have been made against Moscow's forces by Ukrainian civilians and troops.
War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Kyiv's top prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, says the pace of new allegations has intensified, with 200 to 300 cases being reported every day.

Marco Biuss, a first generation Canadian-Ukrainian, flew to Glasgow from Toronto.
""It's more than just a regular football match,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""Emotions are going to be running high.

Russia has accused the US of seeking to prolong the war in Ukraine after President Biden said he would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was ""intentionally adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries.
""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership's willingness to resume peace negotiations,"" he added.
Separately, the German government has promised to send an air defence system to Ukraine.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz told MPs that the IRIS-T system was the most modern Germany possessed and would enable Ukraine to defend an entire city against Russian air attacks.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hit out against the deliveries and said Mr Biden's announcement increased the risk of a ""third country"" being dragged into the conflict.
The long-range missiles are to help Ukrainian troops strike enemy forces more precisely from a longer distance.
The US had previously been unwilling to provide the weapons out of fear they could be used against targets in Russia, but the US says Kyiv has given assurances that this will not happen.
On Wednesday, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
A senior US official said the new weapons package would include four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).
""These are precision guided systems with extended range. And so for high value targets that that allow them to keep some of the pressure off of Ukrainian forces on the front, we think these systems will be very useful,"" Undersecretary for Defense Dr Colin H Kahl said.
The systems can launch multiple precision-guided missiles at targets as far as 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery that Ukraine currently has. They are also believed to be more accurate than their Russian equivalents.
This announcement has been a long time coming and represents one of the most significant military commitments so far.
As they face overwhelming Russian firepower in a grinding, attritional battle for the Donbas, Ukrainian forces complain that they lack firepower.
The HIMARS could change that.
Its GPS-guided rockets are much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. It's also much quicker to reload and, as the name suggests, the launch vehicles can move quickly from one location to another.
US and Ukrainian officials will already be having detailed conversations about how and where to use the HIMARS when they arrive.
Ukraine will be looking to hit targets well beyond its current reach - command and control centres, logistics hubs, and the Russian batteries that have Ukrainian troops pinned down in Donbas.
White House officials agreed to provide the rockets, they said, only after gaining assurances from President Volodomyr Zelensky that the weapons would not be used to attack targets inside Russia.
""We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,"" Mr Biden wrote on Wednesday.
Mr Zelensky confirmed this in an interview for US network Newsmax.
""We're not interested in what is happening in Russia,"" he said. ""We're only interested in our own territory in Ukraine.""
But Mr Peskov said Moscow did not trust Mr Zelensky's remarks.
""In order to have trust, we need to have experience of Kyiv fulfilling its promises, but there is none,"" he said, quoted by Ria news agency.
Addressing the US announcement, he said: ""We believe the US is directly and intentionally adding fuel to the fire... The US is obviously holding the line that it will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian.""
The latest rockets will be the centrepiece of a $700m (£556m) support package for Ukraine that will be formally unveiled later on Wednesday, White House officials said.
Helicopters, anti-tank weapons, tactical vehicles and spare parts are to be included in what will be the 11th package of military aid approved by the US for Ukraine since the invasion began in February.
Meanwhile fighting has intensified around the eastern city of Severodonetsk, where the head of the city administration says Ukrainian forces now hold just 20% of the city.
Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops targeted the city's chemical factory Azot during an artillery barrage.
Regional head Serhiy Gaidai said civilians were sheltering from missile and artillery attacks at the plant.
""There are civilians there in bomb shelters, there are quite a few of them, but it will not be a second Azovstal as that plant had a huge underground city … which isn't there at Azot,"" Mr Gaidai said.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60066015;2022-06-01;Why the Ukraine war may power Asia's green energy shift;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
For years there have been calls for Asia - which is home to some of the world's biggest CO2 emitters - to ditch fossil fuels to help tackle climate change.
Countries in the region - including its three biggest economies China, Japan and India - were criticised last year for not making a bigger commitment at the COP26 global climate change conference.
But six months on, there is another, arguably more immediate reason for Asia to make the transition away from oil, gas and coal: money.
Global energy prices have jumped since late February when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
It has pushed European countries to find ways to rely less on Russian gas with Germany hoping hydrogen could be its answer.
Japan and South Korea had also invested heavily in hydrogen technology before the Ukraine war and the soaring cost of energy has provided an additional incentive to accelerate their transition to greener fuels.
However, Asian economies have continued to burn coal to produce electricity despite how much it pollutes the environment.
While some countries have made progress in moving away from fossil fuels, in emergencies - like when two of the region's economic giants China and India were hit by power shortages - it was coal that they turned to.
Japan had invested in nuclear power for decades but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, it too went back to fossil fuels.
Some experts believe hydrogen can help countries make the transition from fossil fuels to renewables and that is what a growing number of South Korean businesses are now betting on.
The country has so far announced the largest government spending in Asia on the development of hydrogen technology.
Seoul is pushing investments into the production of hydrogen as well as technology for fuel cell power generation and hydrogen-powered cars.
Hydrogen is also considered by some experts to be the most practical alternative to fossil fuels as it can be stored as a solid, liquid or gas.
That means, in comparison to solar and wind, it can be more easily stockpiled and transported.
""Hydrogen is like an energy carrier,"" says Vince Heo of S&P Global Commodity Insights in Seoul.
""You can store energy in the hydrogen and you can use them whenever you want.""
A key issue is that there are different types of hydrogen and what South Korea is currently investing in is not emission-free.
The goal is to eventually transition to so-called ""green hydrogen"", which is also known as ""clean hydrogen"".
It is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, but it is the most expensive type of hydrogen to produce.
That is why hydrogen produced using fossil fuels has been seen by some experts as the first step towards green hydrogen.
""South Korea's hydrogen is currently produced from natural gas,"" Martin Tengler who is BloombergNEF's lead hydrogen analyst says, explaining that it is referred to as ""grey hydrogen"".
The next stage in the transition is ""blue hydrogen"", which is also made using fossil fuels but 60% to 90% of the carbon dioxide produced in the process is captured and stored.
South Korea's biggest natural gas supplier, SK, has invested 18 trillion won, or around ($15bn; £12bn), but only in grey and blue hydrogen.
The boss of its hydrogen business unit, Hyeong-wook Choo, told the BBC the company did not invest in green hydrogen straight away because more technology and investment was needed to do so.
With renewable sources of energy and infrastructure to capture and distribute it not readily available in much of Asia, a major challenge has been to develop the right mix of technologies to harness enough energy to mass produce hydrogen.
""We can develop the market by manufacturing, distributing and consuming hydrogen. So when green hydrogen becomes available, there will be more ability to expand this hydrogen business,"" Mr Choo added.
The crucial issue behind this is how much it costs to produce each of the different types of gas.
""Green hydrogen costs more than two to three times of grey hydrogen,"" says Mr Heo of S&P Global.
""Currently, it's about $10 per kilogramme to produce green hydrogen.""
Mr Heo says to be cost effective, the amount has to decline by 70% to around $3 per kilogramme without government subsidies.
But the jump in global energy prices means that ""there's clearly some momentum on green hydrogen because it is produced from renewable energy which is detached from the high fuel prices environment,"" he added.
For example in Europe, the costs of producing blue and grey hydrogen at times increased by more than 70% following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy.
If affordable green hydrogen becomes available, there are a number of industries that can benefit.
""We can replace grey hydrogen in industries where there are no emissions-low alternatives like refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and heavy industries like steel production which require high temperatures,"" Mr Tengler said.
To be able to compete globally, South Korea has created a hydrogen alliance which more than a dozen companies have joined.
""The hydrogen industry at the moment is like the solar industry about 20 years ago where there are few projects being developed and there is a big ambition in the market,"" said Mr Heo.
Wind power is one of the keys to South Korea's green hydrogen ambitions.
A consortium led by Korea Maritime and Ocean University is developing a floating offshore plant to produce green hydrogen in the city of Busan.
""What we're envisioning is to use electricity from wind and solar out at sea, to boil and electrolyse seawater to produce green hydrogen,"" Doh Deog-hee, President of Korea Maritime and Ocean University said.
Its advantage is its proximity to hydrogen consumers, Mr Heo said: ""You can save the hydrogen transportation costs because that's a big, very expensive part of the hydrogen value chain.""
""But floating offshore wind costs more than $300 per megawatt hour compared to $100 per megawatt hour of using solar power so how to actually optimise the cost of producing hydrogen from this facility is a big question,"" he added.
The transition to cleaner sources of energy has always been costly.
When global leaders met for COP26 in November, the world was starting to face higher fuel prices due to the pent-up demand after the pandemic lockdowns.
For many countries it was, and still is, very tempting to go back to fossil fuels.
The question is whether the soaring fuel prices could be a bigger motivator for a change.For years there have been calls for Asia - which is home to some of the world's biggest CO2 emitters - to ditch fossil fuels to help tackle climate change.
Countries in the region - including its three biggest economies China, Japan and India - were criticised last year for not making a bigger commitment at the COP26 global climate change conference.
But six months on, there is another, arguably more immediate reason for Asia to make the transition away from oil, gas and coal: money.
Global energy prices have jumped since late February when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
It has pushed European countries to find ways to rely less on Russian gas with Germany hoping hydrogen could be its answer.
Japan and South Korea had also invested heavily in hydrogen technology before the Ukraine war and the soaring cost of energy has provided an additional incentive to accelerate their transition to greener fuels.
However, Asian economies have continued to burn coal to produce electricity despite how much it pollutes the environment.
While some countries have made progress in moving away from fossil fuels, in emergencies - like when two of the region's economic giants China and India were hit by power shortages - it was coal that they turned to.
Japan had invested in nuclear power for decades but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, it too went back to fossil fuels.
Some experts believe hydrogen can help countries make the transition from fossil fuels to renewables and that is what a growing number of South Korean businesses are now betting on.
The country has so far announced the largest government spending in Asia on the development of hydrogen technology.
Seoul is pushing investments into the production of hydrogen as well as technology for fuel cell power generation and hydrogen-powered cars.
Hydrogen is also considered by some experts to be the most practical alternative to fossil fuels as it can be stored as a solid, liquid or gas.
That means, in comparison to solar and wind, it can be more easily stockpiled and transported.
""Hydrogen is like an energy carrier,"" says Vince Heo of S&P Global Commodity Insights in Seoul.
""You can store energy in the hydrogen and you can use them whenever you want.""
A key issue is that there are different types of hydrogen and what South Korea is currently investing in is not emission-free.
The goal is to eventually transition to so-called ""green hydrogen"", which is also known as ""clean hydrogen"".
It is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, but it is the most expensive type of hydrogen to produce.
That is why hydrogen produced using fossil fuels has been seen by some experts as the first step towards green hydrogen.
""South Korea's hydrogen is currently produced from natural gas,"" Martin Tengler who is BloombergNEF's lead hydrogen analyst says, explaining that it is referred to as ""grey hydrogen"".
The next stage in the transition is ""blue hydrogen"", which is also made using fossil fuels but 60% to 90% of the carbon dioxide produced in the process is captured and stored.
South Korea's biggest natural gas supplier, SK, has invested 18 trillion won, or around ($15bn; £12bn), but only in grey and blue hydrogen.
The boss of its hydrogen business unit, Hyeong-wook Choo, told the BBC the company did not invest in green hydrogen straight away because more technology and investment was needed to do so.
With renewable sources of energy and infrastructure to capture and distribute it not readily available in much of Asia, a major challenge has been to develop the right mix of technologies to harness enough energy to mass produce hydrogen.
""We can develop the market by manufacturing, distributing and consuming hydrogen. So when green hydrogen becomes available, there will be more ability to expand this hydrogen business,"" Mr Choo added.
The crucial issue behind this is how much it costs to produce each of the different types of gas.
""Green hydrogen costs more than two to three times of grey hydrogen,"" says Mr Heo of S&P Global.
""Currently, it's about $10 per kilogramme to produce green hydrogen.""
Mr Heo says to be cost effective, the amount has to decline by 70% to around $3 per kilogramme without government subsidies.
But the jump in global energy prices means that ""there's clearly some momentum on green hydrogen because it is produced from renewable energy which is detached from the high fuel prices environment,"" he added.
For example in Europe, the costs of producing blue and grey hydrogen at times increased by more than 70% following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy.
If affordable green hydrogen becomes available, there are a number of industries that can benefit.
""We can replace grey hydrogen in industries where there are no emissions-low alternatives like refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and heavy industries like steel production which require high temperatures,"" Mr Tengler said.
To be able to compete globally, South Korea has created a hydrogen alliance which more than a dozen companies have joined.
""The hydrogen industry at the moment is like the solar industry about 20 years ago where there are few projects being developed and there is a big ambition in the market,"" said Mr Heo.

Heavy fighting continues in east Ukraine, with key locations under intense bombardment from Russian forces.
Here are the latest developments:
Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion.
Russia has made slow but significant advances in the east, with the governor of Luhansk saying last week that Russians forces controlled more than 90% of the region.
But a decision by the US to send new longer-range weaponry to Ukraine means it should be easier for the Ukrainians to defend their positions against Russian artillery strikes in the future.
President Joe Biden said the rocket systems were intended to strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
Russian forces are reported to be in control of most of Severodonetsk and Ukrainian forces are said to be withdrawing further to the west.
Taking the city has been one of Russia's key aims as it would mean they control almost all of the Luhansk region.
But the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the Ukrainian call to withdraw from Severodonetsk was ""strategically sound"" as the city's loss was ""largely symbolic"".
Russian troops have moved north from Popasna, with the key supply route from Bakhmut to Lysychansk being bombarded by Russian artillery.
Should the route be taken by Russia, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk would be left with one supply road via Siversk.
Reports suggest that Lyman is now under Russian control, and forces are regrouping to try to take the city of Slovyansk,
Russian forces have suffered heavy losses since the invasion began.
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia is likely to have suffered devastating losses among its middle and junior ranking officers, because they have been deployed at the front lines of fighting. It says these losses are likely to contribute to a loss of morale and poor discipline among lower ranks.
Significant quantities of Russian weaponry have also been destroyed.
As a result, Russia has tried to combine some heavily depleted units, forming what some analysts have called 'Frankenstein forces' to fight in the east.
Ukraine has successfully pushed Russian forces away from Kharkiv, though Russian units are continuing to shell some parts of the city, according to the ISW.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops in the Kharkiv region last week, his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began.
In southern Donetsk, Russia is now fully in control of the port city of Mariupol, after a siege lasting more than two months came to an end on 20 May.
Analysts say the fall of the city may enable Russian units to join the fight in other areas such as Zaporizhzhia, where the shelling of Ukrainian forces is ongoing.
Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.
But strong resistance from Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv in the west and in Mariupol significantly slowed Russian advances.
To the west, Russia had aimed to take control of Odesa and cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but its forces were blocked by a staunch defence in Mykolaiv and forced back towards Kherson by a Ukrainian counteroffensive in March.
The ISW says control of the region around Kherson could be critical to Ukraine's future, if the Ukrainians can regain control of land to the west of the Dnipro river they will be in a stronger position to resist any future Russian invasion.
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv in early April after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital.
Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have seen missile attacks but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61652467;2022-05-31;Ukraine reports 15,000 suspected war crimes;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor said.
Some 600 suspects have been identified and 80 prosecutions have begun, Iryna Venediktova told reporters in The Hague.
The list of suspects includes ""top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russia"", she added.
Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes.
Of the 15,000 alleged war crimes, Ms Veneditkova said several thousand had been identified in the eastern Donbas region - the scene of fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops.
Alleged war crimes in the region include the possible forcible transfer of people - including cases of adults and children - to different parts of Russia, Ms Venediktova said. Torture, the killing of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are also suspected war crimes, she added.
Though investigations relating to the eastern region have started, Ukrainian authorities do not have access to Russian-held areas, AFP news agency reports Ms Venediktova as saying. They were, however, interviewing evacuees and prisoners-of-war, she added.
""Investigations are very difficult when fighting is going on at the same time,"" she is quoted as saying by German news agency DPA.
Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia have also joined the investigation efforts, Ms Venediktova said. Poland and Lithuania were already helping.
The International Criminal Court described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"" and has despatched its largest team of investigators ever to Ukraine to assist in the investigations. It said it was also hoping to open an office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv.
The announcements came as two Russian soldiers were jailed for 11 and a half years in Ukraine on Tuesday for shelling civilian areas. The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a civilian last week.
Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova, was also sacked by Ukraine's parliament. She was criticised for not organising humanitarian corridors and facilitating prisoner exchanges, as well as her handling of alleged rape cases against Russian soldiers, according to local media reports. Ms Denisova said she would appeal the decision.
On the ground, Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region.
The city is said to be divided between the two sides - but not equally. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai said ""70%-80% of the city is controlled by the Russian army"".
An explosion also reportedly hit a nitric acid container in the city, which is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Mr Haidai said. He told the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air following the explosion, but only in a small area.
Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.
Away from the fighting, European Union leaders reached political agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia, excluding pipeline oil, which Hungary had opposed. But EU members remain split over Russian gas exports.
Russian oil giant Gazprom also announced it would be cutting gas supplies to Denmark's Orsted, as well as Shell Europe for its supplies to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles - something Russia has demanded.Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor said.

Alina Koreniuk says the box in the photo contains a new boiler she planned to install before the war started.
She and her children left Ukraine on 8 April and are staying with a British couple in Nottinghamshire.
The picture, taken in late May, shows the tank moving past bombed residential buildings in the town of Popasna.
Russian forces have been in control of the town, in the Luhansk region, since 8 May.
Ms Koreniuk says the photo was taken on a street just five minutes away from her house.
It was originally spotted by her husband.
""He said: 'Do you notice anything strange about this photo,' and asked me if I saw what he saw in it,"" she told the BBC.
Apart from the boiler, other items on the tank include a tablecloth from the family's summer house, new Disney bedsheets for her children and a red blanket, she says.
The bed linen was used to cover something, Ms Koreniuk added, probably a TV or other electronic equipment, all of which had been left at the house when they were forced to leave.
But she wasn't surprised by what had happened.
""Our reaction was that whatever they hadn't destroyed they would steal,"" she said.
""We expected houses in Popasna to be looted, we'd been told many times about this.""
Ms Koreniuk has been staying in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, with her daughters Kristina, 12, and Olha, eight, under the UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme since leaving Ukraine.
Their hosts are thought to be among the first in the country to register for the scheme.
A policewoman and former child psychologist, Ms Koreniuk and her family left Popasna on 24 February when the invasion began. Shelling had already started in the area.
The family took very few of their possessions when they left. Her mother was forced to leave behind a pet dog, which was killed either by shrapnel or by the occupying forces.
Ms Koreniuk described the difficult journey she and her two daughters made out of Ukraine to local media in the UK.
Her mother, grandmother and husband are still in Ukraine but in relative safety.
Many residents of occupied areas of Ukraine have complained of looting by Russian troops.
Last week the independent Russian news site Mediazona published a report suggesting that Russian troops had sent home 58 tonnes of looted goods from areas close to the Ukrainian borders with Russia and Belarus since the start of the invasion.
The packages are said to contain items such as sneakers, canned food, TVs, car tyres and tents.
Russia has not responded to allegations of looting, but officials have accused Ukraine of filming fake videos to accuse Russia of looting.
They have also accused Ukraine of overseeing bands of looters in areas under its control.A Ukrainian refugee in the UK says she recognises items apparently looted from her house sitting on top of a Russian tank in a recent photo.
Alina Koreniuk says the box in the photo contains a new boiler she planned to install before the war started.
She and her children left Ukraine on 8 April and are staying with a British couple in Nottinghamshire.
The picture, taken in late May, shows the tank moving past bombed residential buildings in the town of Popasna.
Russian forces have been in control of the town, in the Luhansk region, since 8 May.
Ms Koreniuk says the photo was taken on a street just five minutes away from her house.
It was originally spotted by her husband.
""He said: 'Do you notice anything strange about this photo,' and asked me if I saw what he saw in it,"" she told the BBC.
Apart from the boiler, other items on the tank include a tablecloth from the family's summer house, new Disney bedsheets for her children and a red blanket, she says.
The bed linen was used to cover something, Ms Koreniuk added, probably a TV or other electronic equipment, all of which had been left at the house when they were forced to leave.
But she wasn't surprised by what had happened.
""Our reaction was that whatever they hadn't destroyed they would steal,"" she said.
""We expected houses in Popasna to be looted, we'd been told many times about this.""
Ms Koreniuk has been staying in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, with her daughters Kristina, 12, and Olha, eight, under the UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme since leaving Ukraine.
Their hosts are thought to be among the first in the country to register for the scheme.
A policewoman and former child psychologist, Ms Koreniuk and her family left Popasna on 24 February when the invasion began. Shelling had already started in the area.
The family took very few of their possessions when they left. Her mother was forced to leave behind a pet dog, which was killed either by shrapnel or by the occupying forces.

A family who fled Ukraine have been reunited with their beloved dog after he spent two months in UK quarantine.
Mike and Alla Haley travelled 2,000 miles (3,218 km) from Kyiv to north-east England with one-year-old Archie.
A technical issue over the Pomeranian's rabies vaccine led to him being quarantined on 1 April and kept from the family as they settled.
Mr Haley, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, who has lived in Ukraine for 17 years, said the couple were ""really happy"".
""He is a bit nervous, he has been in real isolation for two months,"" he said.
The 61-year-old, who taught English and was a translator before the war, said Archie was entertaining child refugees as they fled Ukraine.
""He kept us sane and amused, it felt like he saved us in a way,"" he added.
""Because of the quarantine, it felt like we couldn't save him and we let him down.""
After travelling via Poland to Amsterdam they sailed to North Shields with Archie but the dog was held by the Animal and Plant Health Agency when they arrived, they said.
Mrs Haley, who suffers from panic attacks, was upset at losing her dog and her husband made repeated unsuccessful attempts to find out when they could get him back from a quarantine centre in Aberdeen.
After they spoke to the media, the agency, which is overseen by Defra, said Archie could go home soon.
Mrs Haley, 51, said she has concerns about the dog's ongoing health, as he was forced to have a second rabies vaccine in the UK just six weeks after his first.
Archie must isolate before he is allowed out of the Newcastle flat the family has been loaned with the help of a charity.
Mrs Haley said she was grateful to people in the UK who have made them and her 81-year-old mother Valentyna feel welcome.
The family hopes to return to Kyiv in the summer.
Defra previously said: ""We have increased resources and streamlined processes to ensure those fleeing Ukraine and entering the UK are not delayed by bringing their pets.
""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times and lower-risk animals are being moved into isolation.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61607410;2022-05-31;Ukraine war: Stories of torture emerging out of Kherson;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
While his homemade borsch bubbles on the hob, Olexander Guz shows me pictures of his bruised body on his phone.
The injuries, he says, were inflicted by the Russian authorities. ""They put a bag on my head,"" Olexander tells me. ""The Russians threatened that I would not have kidneys left.""
The BBC has gathered several graphic testimonies of residents in Kherson who say they were tortured.
Warning: this report contains some graphic content that readers may find distressing.
Olexander used to live in Bilozerka, a small village in the Kherson region. He was one of the village's deputies. As a young man he was a conscript in the army, but now runs his own business.
He and his wife were publicly anti-Russia: she attended pro-Ukrainian rallies, he tried to stop Russian troops entering their village.
It wasn't long after Russia took over that soldiers came looking for him.
""They tied a rope around my neck and another around my wrists,"" he recalls. He says they told him to stand with his legs wide apart while they questioned him.
""When I didn't answer them, they hit me between my legs. When I fell, I started to suffocate. As you try to get up, they beat you. Then they ask again.""
Russian troops took control of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, early in the war. Ukrainian TV stations were quickly replaced with Russian state broadcasts. Western products were changed for Russian alternatives.
According to multiple first-hand testimonies, people also began to disappear.
Piecing together what is happening inside Kherson is difficult. As Russia has tightened its grip on the region, people have become increasingly frightened to speak out.
Those who manage to leave often delete all the photos and videos from their phones for fear of being stopped and detained at Russian checkpoints. Olexander sent images of his injuries to his son, who was abroad, for safe keeping before wiping his phone.
It means to corroborate testimonies, it is necessary to speak to multiple people who say they have been victims of torture.
Oleh Baturin is one of them. He was a journalist for an independent newspaper in the Kherson region. Within days of Russia's invasion, he says he was kidnapped.
""They shouted, 'On your knees',"" he says. ""They covered my face... and put my hands behind my back. They beat me on the back, ribs and legs... and hit me with the butt of a machine gun.""
It was only later, when he went to see a doctor, that Oleh realised they had broken four of his ribs. He says he was imprisoned for eight days. In that time, he heard others being tortured and witnessed a young man's mock execution.
Both Olexander and Oleh are now in Ukrainian-held territory. They provided the BBC with photos of what they said were police reports of the abuse.
Some allegations of torture are particularly graphic. I spoke to one doctor who worked in a hospital in Kherson. He asked to remain anonymous, but provided me with a picture of his hospital ID.
""There were signs of bodily mutilation,"" he says, listing haematomas (localised bleeding outside blood vessels that appears as a bad bruise), abrasions, cut marks, signs of electrocution, traces of binding on the hands and strangulation marks on the neck.
He says he also saw burns on people's feet and hands, and that one patient told him he was beaten with a hose filled with sand.
""Some of the worst were burn marks on genitals, a gunshot wound to the head of a girl who was raped and burns from an iron on a patient's back and stomach. The patient told me two wires from a car battery were attached to his groin and he was told to stand on a wet rag"", the doctor adds.
He believes there were many others severely injured who did not receive treatment.
Some stay at home because they are too intimidated to go outside. And some, he says, are ""psychologically pressured"" by the Russians. ""They threaten that their families will be killed, and they intimidate them in every possible way.""
He says he asked the patients why they had been picked by the Russian authorities.
""They were tortured if they did not want to go over to the Russian side, for being at rallies, for being in the territorial defence, for the fact that one of the family members fought against the separatists, some got there randomly.""
Some people are afraid their loved ones could be next.
Victoria (not her real name) fears for her parents, who are still in Kherson. Her father used to be in the Ukrainian territorial defence and has already been kidnapped and beaten once, she tells me.
""They dropped him in the middle of a field. When he got home, after a few minutes he burst into tears, even though he is not a sentimental person. I'm trying to help, but it all made me feel like a little girl.""
Now Victoria worries it could happen again.
The BBC is not the only one investigating what is going on in Kherson. Both the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and Human Rights Watch have told us they are also concerned about the allegations of torture and enforced disappearances.
Belkis Wille, from Human Rights Watch, says the testimony gathered by the BBC is consistent with what they are hearing.
She says the concern is that Russian forces, in areas they are occupying, are continuing to a certain extent to ""terrorise the local civilian population and use abusive practices like arbitrary detention and forced disappearance and torture"".
""These are potential war crimes we're looking at,"" she adds.
The Russian Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Previously, the Kremlin spokesperson said allegations of war crimes in Bucha were ""obvious fakes and the most egregious ones are staged, as has been convincingly proved by our experts.""
Exactly what is happening in Kherson is near impossible to establish from the outside, but as more testimonies are gathered, many paint a picture of fear, intimidation, violence and repression.
Victoria is trying to get her parents out.
""In Kherson, now people go missing all the time,"" she tells me. ""There is a war going on, only this part is without bombs.""While his homemade borsch bubbles on the hob, Olexander Guz shows me pictures of his bruised body on his phone.

Russia's ambassador to Britain has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
Andrei Kelin said that according to Russian military rules, such weapons are not used in conflicts like this.
He also described allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha as ""a fabrication"".
And he called UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss ""very belligerent"" and inexperienced.
On the use of nuclear weapons, Mr Kelin said Russia has very strict rules for their use, mainly when the state's existence is threatened.
""It has nothing to do with the current operation,"" he told BBC One's Sunday Morning.
When Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion, it was widely perceived as a warning.
Mr Putin blamed the development on aggression by the West and Nato. But the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded it an attempt to distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"", saying Russia was behind schedule on its invasion after just a few days, and trying to ""remind the world"" it had a deterrent.
Tactical nuclear weapons are those which can be used at relatively short distances, as opposed to ""strategic"" nuclear weapons which can be launched over much longer distances and raise the spectre of all-out nuclear war.
But the term still includes many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used on a battlefield. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons.
The BBC's Clive Myrie asked the ambassador about comments made by UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who said the war will only end once Russian President Vladimir Putin removes his troops entirely.
Mr Kelin said Ms Truss was ""very belligerent"".
He said she was ""neither a professional military man"" nor experienced as foreign secretary. ""If she would like to continue the war she will prolongate the conflict,"" he added.
In a sometimes terse exchange, the ambassador denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"".
Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.
""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway...""
Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?""
""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied.
Russia has made such allegations before, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier claiming that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew.
This was contradicted by numerous eyewitness accounts from residents, who told the BBC that Russian troops had summarily executed their loved ones.
""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" one man said of his murdered son-in-law.
Satellite imagery also appears to directly contradict Moscow's position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town.
The ambassador was also asked about CCTV footage of Russian soldiers killing unarmed civilians in Ukraine.
Mr Kelin said the footage was ""probably a piece of a film or a piece of a game or a joke or whatever, it's a computer games set"".
What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin is what we've been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
The horrors of Bucha are dismissed as a fabrication, and the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
In other words, none of this is ever Russia's fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
This is the Kremlin narrative which we've heard many times before.
We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we're hearing it again now.

The port city of Berdyansk had been occupied by Russian troops for less than a week, but a new pro-Kremlin online media outlet had already moved in.
The company, whose name translates as Southern Front, makes and distributes pro-Vladimir Putin propaganda across YouTube, social media app Telegram, and through a website that targets areas newly under Russian control.
The Southern Front news site posted its first message on day one of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now has several correspondents filing stories on a daily basis.
The BBC has found evidence that the site's reporting contains falsehoods and misleading claims.
In early March, Southern Front's correspondent was at the scene in Berdyansk. They reported that Russian soldiers had apparently thwarted an attack, and killed two Moroccan men involved. The reporter alleged the men were working as mercenaries for Ukraine.  But it appears elements of the video were staged.
The two Moroccan men identified in the attack were allegedly found with their Ukrainian residency permits still on them.
The BBC tracked down one of the men implicated. According to the report he was dead, but we spoke to him on social media. He requested anonymity but says he was not aware of the Russian report and that he left Ukraine before the invasion and returned to Morocco.
Southern Front regularly posts videos containing unsubstantiated claims.
The majority of the reports claim to show ""peaceful life"" has been established in occupied areas. The channel often runs stories that justify Russia's invasion.
In one video package, a correspondent reports from a library where she says she found numerous examples of books containing ""Nazi symbols"". No evidence is seen on screen. The books that do appear on camera include works by contemporary Ukrainian writers about genuine historical events, such as the battle of Ilovaisk.
""Southern Front is likely to be part of the wider Russian strategy to establish control over the occupied territories of Ukraine,"" says Julia Smirnova, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
The company and its social media channels are portraying the Russian occupation in the southern regions of Ukraine as a ""liberation"", and Russian forces as ""protectors"", says Ms Smirnova.
Southern Front's first message on Telegram to its small audience of 25 subscribers on the day of the invasion said: ""Vladimir Putin announced the start of a special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify the territory of Ukraine!""
Three months into the occupation, its audience has now grown to 23,000.
A website was registered a day after the invasion started. Initially using a Russian server from St Petersburg, it then moved to the American provider Cloudflare, which allows a site to hide the identity of its owner.
The channel produces a regular news service fronted by young, apparently amateur presenters from annexed Crimea or self-declared separatist republics. Ukrainian news sources have been largely cut off.
One of the presenters contacted by BBC Russian said they worked for free, and didn't know who funded the operations.
We also asked Southern Front about the ownership, but did not receive a reply.
But it does appear an influential organisation with ties to the Russian government is hosting Southern Front's content.
After researching dozens of videos, we noticed some clues as to who might be behind the shadowy media organisation.
Many of them were recorded in a conference room displaying the logo of the Russia-Donbas Integration Committee, which suggests this organisation's premises are used to film.  The Crimea-based committee's mission, listed on its website, is to build economic and humanitarian ties with the annexed Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist republics in the Donbas.
The leaders of these self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine have key roles in the organisation. The co-ordinator is Andrei Kozenko — a former Russian MP, currently under US and EU sanctions.
Southern Front's content reaches far beyond its website.
A network of like-minded Telegram accounts covering occupied cities often publishes its material.
Collectively, these channels now have more than 80,000 subscribers, although our research shows at least one-third of these were probably paid for to artificially inflate the audience. In three channels the number of followers jumped by more than 10,000 in an hour overnight on 29 March, according to analysis of TG Stat, which tracks Telegram data.
Despite the relatively small following on social media, Southern Front has been boosted by influential accounts, including a pro-Russian blogger with more than 650,000 followers, and by pro-Kremlin media such as Moskovsky Komsomolets - a Moscow-based newspaper found in most post-Soviet countries.
But the fightback has started. Recently pro-Ukrainian activists hacked Southern Front's website with a message about Kherson, which the region's new rulers say they want to be annexed by Russia.
One of the posts warned that any individuals involved in a so-called referendum on the future of the region will be punished by Ukraine.
It said: ""Welcome to Hell!!!""
Despite the attack, the site was up and running again shortly afterwards.
There are worrying signs for residents if the project establishes itself. After nearby Crimea was annexed in 2014, independent media outlets were expelled, says Ms Smirnova.
""In southern Ukraine, Russian authorities are likely to follow a similar path by threatening and arresting independent journalists, silencing independent media outlets and replacing them with propaganda channels.""
Additional reporting by Samia Hosny and Olga Robinson, BBC Monitoring.The port city of Berdyansk had been occupied by Russian troops for less than a week, but a new pro-Kremlin online media outlet had already moved in.
The company, whose name translates as Southern Front, makes and distributes pro-Vladimir Putin propaganda across YouTube, social media app Telegram, and through a website that targets areas newly under Russian control.
The Southern Front news site posted its first message on day one of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now has several correspondents filing stories on a daily basis.
The BBC has found evidence that the site's reporting contains falsehoods and misleading claims.
In early March, Southern Front's correspondent was at the scene in Berdyansk. They reported that Russian soldiers had apparently thwarted an attack, and killed two Moroccan men involved. The reporter alleged the men were working as mercenaries for Ukraine.  But it appears elements of the video were staged.
The two Moroccan men identified in the attack were allegedly found with their Ukrainian residency permits still on them.
The BBC tracked down one of the men implicated. According to the report he was dead, but we spoke to him on social media. He requested anonymity but says he was not aware of the Russian report and that he left Ukraine before the invasion and returned to Morocco.
Southern Front regularly posts videos containing unsubstantiated claims.
The majority of the reports claim to show ""peaceful life"" has been established in occupied areas. The channel often runs stories that justify Russia's invasion.
In one video package, a correspondent reports from a library where she says she found numerous examples of books containing ""Nazi symbols"". No evidence is seen on screen. The books that do appear on camera include works by contemporary Ukrainian writers about genuine historical events, such as the battle of Ilovaisk.
""Southern Front is likely to be part of the wider Russian strategy to establish control over the occupied territories of Ukraine,"" says Julia Smirnova, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
The company and its social media channels are portraying the Russian occupation in the southern regions of Ukraine as a ""liberation"", and Russian forces as ""protectors"", says Ms Smirnova.
Southern Front's first message on Telegram to its small audience of 25 subscribers on the day of the invasion said: ""Vladimir Putin announced the start of a special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify the territory of Ukraine!""
Three months into the occupation, its audience has now grown to 23,000.
A website was registered a day after the invasion started. Initially using a Russian server from St Petersburg, it then moved to the American provider Cloudflare, which allows a site to hide the identity of its owner.
The channel produces a regular news service fronted by young, apparently amateur presenters from annexed Crimea or self-declared separatist republics. Ukrainian news sources have been largely cut off.
One of the presenters contacted by BBC Russian said they worked for free, and didn't know who funded the operations.
We also asked Southern Front about the ownership, but did not receive a reply.
But it does appear an influential organisation with ties to the Russian government is hosting Southern Front's content.
After researching dozens of videos, we noticed some clues as to who might be behind the shadowy media organisation.
Many of them were recorded in a conference room displaying the logo of the Russia-Donbas Integration Committee, which suggests this organisation's premises are used to film.  The Crimea-based committee's mission, listed on its website, is to build economic and humanitarian ties with the annexed Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist republics in the Donbas.
The leaders of these self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine have key roles in the organisation. The co-ordinator is Andrei Kozenko — a former Russian MP, currently under US and EU sanctions.
Southern Front's content reaches far beyond its website.
A network of like-minded Telegram accounts covering occupied cities often publishes its material.
Collectively, these channels now have more than 80,000 subscribers, although our research shows at least one-third of these were probably paid for to artificially inflate the audience. In three channels the number of followers jumped by more than 10,000 in an hour overnight on 29 March, according to analysis of TG Stat, which tracks Telegram data.
Despite the relatively small following on social media, Southern Front has been boosted by influential accounts, including a pro-Russian blogger with more than 650,000 followers, and by pro-Kremlin media such as Moskovsky Komsomolets - a Moscow-based newspaper found in most post-Soviet countries.
But the fightback has started. Recently pro-Ukrainian activists hacked Southern Front's website with a message about Kherson, which the region's new rulers say they want to be annexed by Russia.
One of the posts warned that any individuals involved in a so-called referendum on the future of the region will be punished by Ukraine.
It said: ""Welcome to Hell!!!""

The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine.
Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation.
President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have urged delivery of the MLRS to counter Russia's heavy bombardments in the eastern Donbas region.
But President Joe Biden said the US would not send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
There are concerns that such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Moscow.
Moscow has welcomed President Biden's decision not to send weapons to Ukraine that could reach deep inside Russia.
Russia continues to pound Severodonetsk and other parts of Donbas with rockets, tanks and air strikes.
Kyiv's forces are already using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But the MLRS would allow Ukraine to reach targets much further away than that.
An M270 MLRS battery can fire a range of munitions, with the most advanced able to hit targets up to 300km (186 miles) away. However, it can also fire shorter-range rockets with a range of around 70km (43 miles).
Limiting Ukraine to the smaller rockets could be a way for the US to avoid escalating the conflict, while still significantly improving Ukraine's arsenal.
A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range weapons compatible with the system.
The UK also has the MLRS. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine should get the rockets ""to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery"", but he did not say the UK would supply them.
The US used the MLRS to destroy major Iraqi targets in the 1990-91 Gulf War and in 2003.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of ""pumping up the Ukrainian nationalists with weapons"".
He said the West was ""waging a proxy war"" against Russia which, he warned, would mean ""inevitable escalation"".
Last week, a presenter on Russian state TV said the US would be crossing a ""red line"" by supplying the MLRS to Ukraine, and it would be seen as an attempt to ""provoke a very harsh response from Russia"".
In an extra move to defend Ukraine's key Black Sea port - Odesa - Denmark has supplied Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, with a range of about 130km (70 nautical miles).
Ukraine can deploy them alongside its own Neptune missiles, credited with having sunk Russia's flagship cruiser Moskva last month.
Russian long-range missiles have struck railway facilities, oil depots and other infrastructure in western Ukraine - seen partly as an effort to thwart Western arms deliveries.
Meanwhile, Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area - a weapon described as a giant flamethrower. Its use was reported by Tass news agency, quoting a Russian security official.
The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates a massive explosion by igniting a gas cloud on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.

European Union countries are struggling to impose a future ban on Russian oil imports, with Hungary the principal opponent.
Hungary is a major importer of Russian oil. With Hungary facing a cost-of-living crisis, it said the sanction would amount to an ""atomic bomb"" dropped on Hungary's economy. Its President, Victor Orban, is also a long-term ally of Putin.
The proposed measure is part of a sixth package of sanctions being discussed by the bloc at its summit in Brussels, and requires the agreement of all 27 member states.
Addressing the summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the assembled leaders to end internal rows.
""It is time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole,""  he said.
Meanwhile on the ground in Donbas, fierce fighting has been continuing in the city of Severodonetsk with Russian forces pushing towards its centre.
Local administration head Roman Vlasenko said the enemy had entered from two directions but that Ukrainian forces were holding their ground. If Russian forces take the city, they will almost have completed their conquest of the Luhansk Region - a major strategic aim.
Much of the fighting in Ukraine this week is focused on the city of Severodonetsk, in the eastern Donbas region.

For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians.
""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station.""
His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says, and one of his friends was killed there.
A French journalist has been killed in Luhansk region when an armoured evacuation vehicle he was travelling in was hit by Russian shelling.

The Luhansk military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, said the incident had prompted the suspension of civilian evacuations in the region.
Russia has always denied deliberately targeting civilians in the conflict.
Is President Putin well? Yes, says Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill.
There have been unconfirmed rumours that Mr Putin, who turns 70 this year, may be suffering from ill health, possibly cancer.
In an interview with French TV, Mr Lavrov said the Russian leader appears in public every day, and no sane person would see any signs of an ailment.

ScotRail said 13 post-match services had been added.
It tweeted: ""We said we'd do our best to put on extra late-night services for supporters going to the Scotland vs Ukraine World Cup play-off at Hampden on Wednesday and we've been working hard to do that. We've managed to schedule these extra services.""
They include more trains to Edinburgh, Stirling, Ayr, Gourock, East Kilbride and Neilston.
However there will still be no way for fans travelling to Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness or Dumfries to return home by train.
An emergency timetable is in place on ScotRail trains due to a driver dispute over pay.
Earlier ScotRail said its final services to most of Scotland's cities were due to leave before kick off at 19:45.
Some additional trains and extra seats were already laid on within the city, allowing fans to travel between Glasgow Central and stations near Hampden Park.
But the latest service outside Glasgow would have been to Edinburgh, due to depart Glasgow Queen Street station at 22:15.
Even if the match finished after 90 minutes - at 21:30 - fans would have been unable to leave Hampden and get to Queen Street in time for the last train.
Although additional services have no been added, supporters from locations further afield will still have to look for alternative transport.
The final service to both Aberdeen and Dundee will leave Glasgow at 19:45 - according to the ScotRail app - while the latest anyone can return to Dumfries would be 19:07.
Those hoping to head back to Inverness will be unable to do so after 19:07 and those hoping to return to Perth will need to make the 19:37 service.
The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the additional services, but said if this was how nationalised ScotRail would manage major events, passengers faced ""a summer of misery"".
Transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""This is a welcome, last-minute U-turn by ScotRail after a day of chaos in which they initially refused to lay on later trains for fans heading back to Edinburgh.

""As they have already stated, ScotRail will provide further information as soon as possible.""
The newly nationalised rail operator has been hit by a pay dispute with train drivers union Aslef, which has meant staff have refused to work on their rest days.
The temporary timetable brought in a week ago saw almost 700 fewer services a day, with many later trains cancelled.
Train drivers rejected a 2.2% pay offer but were offered a 4.2% pay rise and improved conditions on Thursday.

""We'll be doing everything we can to support fans travelling to the games by adding additional services where we can and more seats to trains where possible. The temporary timetable will still be in place, so it is important that fans plan ahead to make sure they are aware of their options for both getting into the city, and for completing their journey home.
""Regular commuters who travel home from Glasgow on the line via Mount Florida should be aware that services will be much busier than normal on Wednesday night with fans heading to the match."""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill.
In an interview with French TV, Mr Lavrov said the Russian leader appears in public every day, and no sane person would see any signs of an ailment.
There has been increasing unconfirmed media speculation that Mr Putin, who turns 70 this year, may be suffering from ill health, possibly cancer.
The interview came as Russia continues its advance in Ukraine's Donbas region.
Mr Lavrov said the ""liberation"" of the eastern region was an ""unconditional priority"" for Russia.
He repeated the Kremlin's widely discredited line that Russia is fighting a ""neo-Nazi regime"".
Noting that President Putin regularly appeared in public, Mr Lavrov told TF1: ""I don't think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.""
""You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches,"" he said in comments released by the Russian foreign ministry.
""I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours despite daily opportunities to assess how anyone is looking.""
British intelligence sources were quoted telling media outlets that Mr Putin was seriously ill in the last week. However, rumours about the condition of the Russian leader, long known for his healthy lifestyle and love of sport, have surfaced periodically for years.
Western intelligence agencies have been taking a close interest in President Putin's health, both mental and physical.
This is not just because he gave the order to launch the ill-planned invasion of Ukraine, it's also due to the fact that he has almost sole authority over the use of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal.
They need to know if he is about to launch an impetuous tactical nuclear strike in Ukraine that would shatter the 77-year long absence of these weapons being used in war.
Is he mad? No. He is in full control of his faculties. But he has grown steadily angrier with the West.
Two years of Covid-inspired isolation have reinforced Putin's paranoia that everything the West and Nato does is to the detriment of Russia. But speculation in the western media that he has serious health problems veer - so far - more towards wishful thinking than anything backed up by hard medical evidence.
Asked about the human cost of the fighting, which has seen devastating artillery and rocket attacks on some urban areas, Mr Lavrov insisted Russian soldiers were ""under strict orders categorically to avoid attacks and strikes on civilian infrastructure"".
Since Russia invaded on 24 February, at least 4,031 civilians have been killed and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, and an unknown number of combatants have died or been wounded. More than 14 million people have fled their homes, with towns and cities reduced to rubble.
The fighting is now focused on the Donbas - the mining belt made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Separatists in the two regions, which historically have strong ties to Russia, broke away in 2014 and are now fighting alongside Russian troops to take full control.
Mr Lavrov told TF1 that winning in ""the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority"".
However, he added, it was up to the rest of Ukraine if people there were ""happy to return to the authority of a neo-Nazi regime that has proven it is Russophobic in essence"".
Russia has already been forced to pull back from an attempt to overrun the capital Kyiv, after been repelled by Ukrainian forces.
They have also been pushed back from the second city, Kharkiv, in recent weeks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky making a morale-boosting trip to the battle scarred city on Sunday.
Speaking in the city, he said his soldiers would defend their land ""to the last man"". ""They [the Russians] have no chance,"" he said. ""We will fight and we will definitely win.""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill.

Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian band which won this year's Eurovision Song Contest, have sold their trophy for $900,000 (£712,000; €838,000) to raise money for the war in Ukraine.
The crystal microphone was auctioned on Facebook, with the aim of buying drones for Ukraine's military.
The sale coincided with the band's appearance at a charity concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.
It aimed to raise money for medical care and supplies.
Speaking at the concert, band member Oleh Psiuk appealed for people not to get used to the war, which has left at least 4,031 civilians dead and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, along with an unknown number of combatants.
It has also forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes since Russia invaded on 24 February, with towns and cities reduced to rubble.
""I think it should be on the front pages always, until peace comes,"" said Psiuk, whose Eurovision win had been hotly tipped in the run up to the contest. Their song, Stefania, was originally written in tribute to Psiuk's mother, but emotive lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" have been re-interpreted as a rallying cry.
Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula announced that the money raised from the sale of the trophy would be used to purchase three Ukrainian-made PD-2 drones, Reuters news agency reports.

Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Back then, the 19-year-old had just put university on hold and volunteered to fight.
Last week he made a difficult journey out of the Donbas front line, using back roads at night to avoid artillery fire, to pick up supplies for his unit and to tell me what it has been like fighting the Russians.
We met in Bakhmut, a small town well within the range of Russian artillery. Some of its buildings are in ruins and the city has been almost emptied of civilians.
For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians.
""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station.""
His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says.
""One of my friends was killed there and maybe 10 or 15 guys were injured seriously.""
Now, summer is almost on them and Ukraine's fertile black soil is bursting with life, the deadliest fighting is in Donbas. Russia's generals are learning from its enemy's victories around Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second city.
Defeat in March led the Russian army to fall back, in April and May, on what it knows best. Its forces and fearsome firepower are concentrated in a narrow sector of east Ukraine. Now it is close to forcing Ukrainian forces out of Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up Donbas. The other, Donetsk, where Ukraine has a bigger footprint, is already being hit by Russian artillery.
I first came across Maxsym, a biology student, in early March. He, and his university friend Dmytro Kisilenko, an 18-year-old studying economics, had signed up to fight shortly after Russia launched its invasion.
As they waited alongside others like them, in the bitter cold, to be bussed to their training centre, they looked like young lads off to a festival or a camping trip, except for the old Kalashnikovs they had just been issued. Witnessing 18- and 19-year-olds, full of the invincible sense that young men have, going to war in Europe, just as they had during the blood-soaked years of the 20th Century was moving, depressing, and alarming. It was a sign of the big war that was coming.
In March, Maxsym and Dmytro and all Ukrainians were adapting, the way human beings always do in war. After the first shock old lives and routines fade into a new, all-consuming version of real life. During their brief training early in March, we talked about how the war was changing everything. Maxsym already sounded old for his years.
""We can't meet our wives, our girlfriends, our children. We can't do our business, like we were doing before the invasion. But everyone understands that we have a more important mission now. And we will continue doing business, growing up our children. We will kiss our wives and girlfriends many times, but after the war.""
Their lives, those of every Ukrainian, were turned upside down, when the Russians invaded on 24 February. So have the lives of all of us who aren't Ukrainian.
Despite Russian advances, Maxsym retains an iron-clad determination to fight. His friend Dmytro, who fought in the battle for Kyiv, is remains in the capital. As they were students, service in the Donbas is not compulsory.
""As long as it's necessary to hold, we are ready to freeze in trenches, to lose our hearing. We are ready even to die there, but we will win as much time as it's necessary for the entire civilized world to beat Russia in non-military ways.""
He has no time for people calling themselves Ukraine's allies, who say they should trade territory for some kind of accommodation with Vladimir Putin's Russia.
""I think that there is no way to make a deal with Putin. Putin understands only the language of bullets, blood, war crimes and something else. It is impossible to say take this part of the land and the war will end.""
I asked Maxsym how the war was changing him. At the start of the year, he was arranging concerts and involved with youth politics in Kyiv.
""Even now I can't answer you exactly because it is very hard to understand that some of your friends, they died in your arms. It is hard to live with that fact... and when we left Rubizhne, it was hard for us to understand that we have lost the battle for this factory; for one of the key cities of Luhansk region.""
Back in March, Maxsym used to joke that he hadn't told his parents exactly what he was doing in uniform.
""Now my parents understand me 100%. I try to call them every time I can. My mama sent some uniform for me and my brothers."" His father tried to join the territorial defence in Maxsym's home town, Sumy. ""But he's 65 and too old to fight. So when they turned him down, he phoned me and says 'Maxsym, can I become a part of your unit?'
""They understand me. They support me mentally and financially.""
Donbas is full of signs that the Ukrainians expect to lose more territory to this Russian offensive. New lines of trenches have been dug in the rear. Convoys of huge, expensive tractors are being driven west. The sophisticated heavy weapons that they need to try to match and even outgun Russian firepower are arriving, but not fast enough yet to force the invaders back.
Maxsym the student has turned into a front-line soldier, engaged he believes in the mission of his life.
""We are fighting for the freedom of the entire world, the entire civilised world and if anyone thinks it is a Ukrainian-Russian war, it isn't. It is the war of the light and the darkness between the Russia and the entire world.""Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met troops in the heavily shell-damaged city of Kharkiv - his first official visit to the east of the country since the Russian invasion.
He thanked the troops, handed out medals, and said they were facing an ""indescribably difficult"" situation.
Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, after a fortnight of comparative quiet. The industrial city is 42km (26 miles) from the Russian border.
Mr Zelensky later announced he had fired the head of the Ukraine Security Service in Kharkiv region, Roman Dudin. He accused him of not working on the city's defence.
Ukraine says Russia is still occupying a third of the Kharkiv region. Russian troops have been pushed back from the city's outskirts, but it remains within artillery range.
The heaviest fighting is now south-east of Kharkiv, as Russia uses artillery barrages and air strikes to push the Ukrainians from their remaining strongholds in the Donbas region. Kyiv's forces are putting up stiff resistance.

The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine.
Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation.
President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have appealed for the MLRS to counter Russia's offensive in the Donbas.
Kyiv's forces are using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But an M270 MLRS battery can fire rockets at targets up to 300km (186km) distant, as can a similar US rocket system called M142 Himars.
They would greatly boost the Ukrainians' capabilities - even enabling them to hit targets inside Russia, though such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Russia.
A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range rockets compatible with the system.
Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, engaged in a terse interview with the BBC's Clive Myrie on the Sunday Morning programme.
He said that Russia would not use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as it has very strict rules for their use, which apply mainly when the state's existence is threatened.
Asked about civilian killings in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, he said reports of war crimes there were a ""fabrication"" orchestrated by the Ukrainian side after Russia's withdrawal.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited troops in the Kharkiv region, on the country's battered eastern front line.
It was his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began on 24 February.
He was pictured in a bullet-proof vest surveying ruins in Kharkiv city.
Mr Zelensky told soldiers, ""I want to thank each of you for your service."" Later, he sacked the local security chief for ""not defending"" the city.
Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv - Ukraine's second-largest city - in recent days after a fortnight of comparative quiet.
The city - Ukraine's second-largest - faced intense bombardment in the war's first months, with images showing tower blocks flattened to rubble.
Russian troops were gradually pushed back from its surrounding towns during April and May, prompting some who had fled Kharkiv to return, and the metro to reopen for the first time since the invasion.
But the city remains within range of Russian artillery. Several loud explosions were heard in the city after Mr Zelensky's visit.
President Zelensky's office posted a video on Telegram with the caption: ""2,229 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv and the region. We will restore, rebuild and bring back life. In Kharkiv and all other towns and villages where evil came.""
The footage featured Ukrainian soldiers giving Mr Zelensky a tour of the damage wrought by the war, including broken down military vehicles by the side of a road.
""In this war, the occupiers are trying to squeeze out at least some result,"" Mr Zelensky posted later.
""But they should have understood long ago that we will defend our land to the last man. They have no chance. We will fight and we will definitely win.""
The president said he had fired Roman Dudin, the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine for the Kharkiv region ""for the fact that he did not work on the defence of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself"".
""On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out,"" he added.
Analysis by Joe Inwood, BBC News Ukraine Correspondent
Today's visit to Kharkiv is the first time President Zelensky has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia's invasion.
He met the troops who have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine's second city. A few weeks ago, this morale-boosting visit would never have been possible.

""Now the priority is for the wounded and people who need serious medical assistance.""Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited troops in the Kharkiv region, on the country's battered eastern front line.
It was his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began on 24 February.
He was pictured in a bullet-proof vest surveying ruins in Kharkiv city.
Mr Zelensky told soldiers, ""I want to thank each of you for your service."" Later, he sacked the local security chief for ""not defending"" the city.
Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv - Ukraine's second-largest city - in recent days after a fortnight of comparative quiet.
The city - Ukraine's second-largest - faced intense bombardment in the war's first months, with images showing tower blocks flattened to rubble.
Russian troops were gradually pushed back from its surrounding towns during April and May, prompting some who had fled Kharkiv to return, and the metro to reopen for the first time since the invasion.
But the city remains within range of Russian artillery. Several loud explosions were heard in the city after Mr Zelensky's visit.
President Zelensky's office posted a video on Telegram with the caption: ""2,229 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv and the region. We will restore, rebuild and bring back life. In Kharkiv and all other towns and villages where evil came.""
The footage featured Ukrainian soldiers giving Mr Zelensky a tour of the damage wrought by the war, including broken down military vehicles by the side of a road.
""In this war, the occupiers are trying to squeeze out at least some result,"" Mr Zelensky posted later.
""But they should have understood long ago that we will defend our land to the last man. They have no chance. We will fight and we will definitely win.""
The president said he had fired Roman Dudin, the chief of the Security Service of Ukraine for the Kharkiv region ""for the fact that he did not work on the defence of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself"".
""On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out,"" he added.

Russia has scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, paving the way for more civilian experts to be recruited for the Ukraine conflict.
President Vladimir Putin has signed a law enabling people over 40 to enlist for the armed forces. They are expected to be people of normal working age.
Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners.
Russia is presenting it as a move to recruit more technical specialists.
The new law says specialists are required to operate high-precision weapons and ""experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45"". More medics, engineers and communications experts may also be recruited.
Ukrainian and Western military experts say Russia has suffered heavy losses in the war: about 30,000 killed, according to Ukraine, while the UK government estimates the toll at about 15,000. In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan in the 1980s totalled about 15,000.
Russia gave a total of 1,351 of its troops killed in Ukraine on 25 March, which it has not updated.
President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
But in March Russia's defence ministry admitted that some conscripts were involved in the conflict and some had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle.
Later, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that those conscripts drafted into the military this spring would not be sent to any hotspots.
Conscription, also known as the draft, is a centuries-old practice for states to require large numbers of men to serve in the military. Russia's conscription, dating back to tsarist times, obliges men aged 18 to 27 to serve one year in the military. But many get exemptions on medical grounds, or because they are students.
Russia now has more than 400,000 professional ""contract"" soldiers in its 900,000-strong active armed forces. It can also mobilise about two million reservists, military analysts say.
Ukraine's army is a lot smaller - it has an estimated 200,000 active troops and 900,000 reservists, though it has boosted those numbers through mass mobilisation since Russia invaded on 24 February.
Under its current martial law, Ukraine forbids men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, demanding that they stay and fight. So women, children and the elderly form the vast majority of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries.
Ukraine's military says it is not yet conscripting women, but some can be drafted exceptionally if their skills in medicine, IT or other areas are needed. Ukraine has also recruited several thousand foreign volunteer soldiers.
Many countries have military conscription, though the rules vary widely. They include Israel, Turkey, Iran, Sweden and Georgia.
The UK and US are among many other countries which have fully professional armies, as well as reservists who can be called up in an emergency.

The leaders of France and Germany have urged Russia's Vladimir Putin to hold ""direct [and] serious negotiations"" with Ukraine's president, the German chancellor's office said.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz spoke to Mr Putin by phone for 80 minutes.
The pair ""insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops"", the chancellor's office said.
Russia's leader said Moscow was open to resuming dialogue with Kyiv, according to the Kremlin.
It did not mention the possibility of direct talks between Mr Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Ukrainian president earlier said he was not ""eager"" for talks, but added they would likely be necessary to end the conflict.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held multiple rounds of talks remotely and in person since Russia invaded on 24 February, but efforts have stalled of late.
France and Germany also urged Mr Putin to release 2,500 Ukrainian fighters taken as prisoners-of-war at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
The sprawling factory became the last holdout in the southern port city, which endured relentless bombardment from Russian forces and now lies in ruins.
Earlier this month, Moscow officials said the last fighters defending the plant had surrendered, while President Zelensky said they had been given permission to leave.
Russia has previously said more than 900 of the fighters were moved to a reopened prison colony in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk. A smaller number with serious wounds were taken to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Donetsk.
Ukraine hopes they will be released as part of a prisoner exchange - but Russia has not confirmed that. Some Russian lawmakers argue the fighters should be tried or even executed.
Also during the call, the French and German leaders asked Mr Putin to lift Russia's blockade of the Ukrainian port of Odesa, to allow for grain exports.
The Kremlin said Mr Putin offered to look at options, to help address the risk of a global food crisis - but demanded that the West lift sanctions.
Russia also warned France and Germany against increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine, saying that could increase instability still further.
Analysis by Joe Inwood, Ukraine Correspondent
To read the Kremlin's report of the call between Presidents Putin and Macron and Chancellor Scholz, Russia is engaged in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Its actions in the southern port of Mariupol - a city that has been reduced to rubble - are all about ""establishing peaceful life"" and ""liberation"".
It is a stark contrast not just with the readout from the EU allies - who said the focus was on the welfare of the 2,500 prisoners-of-war who surrendered - but with the evidence of all independent observers.  There are multiple, credible reports of war crimes carried out by occupying Russian forces.
Despite that, the fact that the two most powerful leaders in the EU are holding direct talks with Russia's president is significant.
Their call for a diplomatic solution - even as Russian forces advance in the Donbas - is not supported by all Western allies, who fear it could put pressure on Ukraine to cede territory in return for peace.
It all comes as Moscow claims to have captured the crucial crossroads city of Lyman - and continues its assault of Severodonetsk. The industrial city has been encircled for days - with reports that Ukraine may order a strategic withdrawal of its forces.
It is too soon to say that today's attempts at diplomacy represent a fracturing of the Western alliance… but different positions are beginning to emerge.
In an operational update issued on Sunday, Ukrainian military officials said that intense fighting has continued around the city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost place still under Ukrainian control.
The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said two civilians were killed overnight as Russia continued firing heavily on the city with missile and artillery strikes.
On Friday, officials said two-thirds of its perimeter was surrounded by Russian forces.
Mr Haidai had said Ukrainian troops could be forced to withdraw from Severodonetsk, observing: ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave.""
But Yelyzaveta Yasko, a local MP for the region, said on Sunday that Kyiv's troops remained entrenched across the city.
""Severodonetsk for Putin became like one of the places that he really wants to take because he believes that it will give him military power over the whole Donbas region but, as we see that no matter how hard the battles are, still they didn't take it over, all of it,"" she said.
""But for me very painful to say because we still know and hear about the numbers of the victims that are happening there everyday and unfortunately the situation becomes worse also from the humanitarian side,"" Ms Yasko observed.
In comments to the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the Russian invasion of his country had destroyed more than 25,000 km (15,000 miles) of roads, several hundred bridges, and 12 airports.
More than 100 educational institutions, over 500 medical facilities, and 200 factories have also been ruined or damaged, he said.

Narva is a strange place, almost an aberration. On the very edge of Nato's eastern flank, it is Estonia's third biggest city - but its population of nearly 60,000 is 97% Russian-speaking, making it the largest Russian-speaking city in the EU.
It sits on the western bank of the River Narva that flows into the Baltic Sea. On the eastern bank is Russia. To a first-time visitor it feels like a classic Cold War frontier. Two giant fortresses face each other on opposing sides of the river, with the international border running down the middle.

Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin. What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world?
In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region.
Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked.
Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound.
""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out.""

Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"".
When Russia's leader talks about Donbas, he is not just referring to Ukraine's coal and steel-producing area. He is highlighting two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia.
Donbas is predominantly Russian-speaking and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, its proxy forces captured more than a third of Ukraine's east in a war that never came to an end.
The Russian proxies created so-called people's republics that nobody recognised and Russia now plans to capture the rest of the east.
Luhansk and Donetsk may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. One Ukrainian opinion poll in May 2022 suggested 82% of Ukrainians in territory seized by Russia since the 24 February invasion had a negative attitude to Moscow.
A month into the invasion, Russia scaled back its ambitions to capture the capital, Kyiv, and instead moved its focus to Donbas. By late March it claimed to have controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk, although that was certainly an overstatement.
Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky declared in April that Russian forces had begun the battle for Donbas and that Ukrainian forces had long prepared for it. Russia is far from subduing the entire area, although if it captures the two big twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, then all of Luhansk would be under its control.
Just before he launched the war, President Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent of Ukraine, not just the limited statelets created by Moscow-backed proxies.
He has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. The conflict there has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2014, but three-quarters of those were combatants and the 420km line of contact didn't change significantly after 2015.
As Russia's failure to capture Kyiv became clear, it switched attention to ""achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas"".
Moscow's likely next step would be to annexe Donbas and other adjacent areas, exactly as President Putin did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014.
US officials believe annexation is on the cards, and Russia's puppet leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, has said referendums would make sense when Russian forces complete the capture of both regions. The outside world would regard any vote as a sham, but he sees the result as ""obvious"".
Russia's military is pushing forward in Luhansk and Donetsk and digging in in areas of the south, having taken control of the region of Kherson, to the north and west of Crimea, as well as part of Zaporizhzhia. Russia has already secured a land corridor from Crimea to the Russian border with the capture of Mariupol, and it has control of the water supply to Crimea as well as Europe's biggest power plant.
So would victory in Donbas be sufficient for Vladimir Putin?
It is impossible to know what he is thinking and what his relationship is with his military command, says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. But if Russia is successful in Luhansk and Donetsk, then he believes Russia will assess the state of the Ukrainian forces: ""If the Russians feel that they are able to gain more of their stated goals, I suspect they will go for them.""
Leading Russian figures including Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev have made clear they are not chasing deadlines but are prepared for a protracted war.
If they are successful in Donbas, they may have designs on extending gains in the south. Russian troops have fired missiles at the big city of Zaporizhzhia and President Putin has signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports.
One Russian general has suggested the aim is to conquer Ukraine's Black Sea coast to the west beyond Odesa, but for now that seems little more than an aspiration.
For weeks Russian forces have bombarded Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Ukrainian forces have retreated from Lyman. They have also broken through at Popasna and are threatening key Ukrainian arterial routes and supply lines, particularly the roads from Lysychansk to Bakhmut and the major M03 motorway from Slovyansk to Bakhmut.
The battle for Luhansk has entered a decisive phase, says regional military administration head Serhiy Haidai.
Many of these towns have already experienced years of war since Russia's proxies first seized large parts of Donbas. Severodonetsk is normally a city of 100,000 people - 15,000 were still there, mainly in bomb shelters, as Russian troops advanced in late May.
Maryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk weeks before: ""They attacked hospitals and residential buildings,"" she said.
Another big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. Capturing Kramatorsk, just to the south, is also a big objective.
But Russian progress has been slow and Ukrainian defence officials believe they are running low on high-precision weapons.
""This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,"" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.
The Russians have already succeeded in blocking most rail traffic to the east. That was the fastest route for fleeing civilians but also the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry. Train lines in and out of Donbas have been cut and the only services remaining are going to Pokrovsk.
Serhiy Haidai believes Russia's leader is now determined to capture the Luhansk region, no matter what the cost - in money, soldiers' lives or military equipment.
At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has.
President Zelensky revealed on 22 May that between 50 to 100 soldiers may be dying every day in their defence of eastern Ukraine. That would indicate an even larger number of wounded and Sam Cranny-Evans believes it is likely that some brigades are no longer combat effective.
""It is hard to assess whether or not they are in a good place right now. If the above attrition rates are accurate, it could be very problematic.""
US officials have estimated that some 93 Russian battalion tactical groups were operating in the east, each numbering 700 to 900 men. But they too have suffered from high losses and low morale. Their units are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas, many under duress, as well as the broader Russian army.
Russia studies analyst Michael Kofman says the military balance in the war overall weighs in Ukraine's favour, because of manpower availability and access to Western military support, but in Donbas it is too early to say how the war will go: ""Ukraine may lose territory in the short term, but Russia faces major problems with sustaining its military effort in the long term, or holding on to gains"".
That is why Ukraine is calling on its Western allies to speed up deliveries of heavy weapons including long-range artillery.
Life in the Russian proxy-held areas of Ukraine is far quieter than elsewhere in the east, although the so-called people's republics have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say dozens of civilians have died since mid-February. Far more have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainian-controlled territory.
One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that men of military age were required to join the local Russian proxy militia, so anyone who wanted to avoid mobilisation was in hiding. People called it ""mogilisation"" after the Russian word mogila which means grave, she said.
""There are many dead and many funerals. Wives often do not know anything about the fate of their mobilised husbands.""
Asked about the prospect of a vote on joining Russia, she said people understood they had no real say in the matter: ""It's like a train you can't get off.""Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of ""liberating"" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas.
Having abandoned his campaign to capture the capital Kyiv and second city Kharkiv, Vladimir Putin is now looking for military victory in the largely Russian-speaking east, where he falsely accuses Ukraine of committing genocide.
Achieving his goals in the east is the minimum he needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success.
Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"".
When Russia's leader talks about Donbas, he is not just referring to Ukraine's coal and steel-producing area. He is highlighting two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia.
Donbas is predominantly Russian-speaking and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, its proxy forces captured more than a third of Ukraine's east in a war that never came to an end.
The Russian proxies created so-called people's republics that nobody recognised and Russia now plans to capture the rest of the east.
Luhansk and Donetsk may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. One Ukrainian opinion poll in May 2022 suggested 82% of Ukrainians in territory seized by Russia since the 24 February invasion had a negative attitude to Moscow.

A woman who fled Ukraine has said she feels ""isolated"" after failing to find a vegan-friendly host.
Oksana Kopanitsyna said being in the same room as someone eating or preparing meat was like ""someone was cutting a child in front of you"".
Now living in a bed and breakfast in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county, she said her beliefs were being tested as she looks for her own place to live.
The charity Vegan Society said this problem was not uncommon.
Oksana was living in Kyiv when she decided it was no longer safe to stay and began her long journey through Europe to the UK.
She left her family, her job and her friends behind due to the war.
Her grandparents had told her stories of starvation from the past, and when supermarket shelves began to empty, she became ""very scared"".
She is dependent on medication and began her journey to Wales in early March, spending nights on train station floors, camping and sleeping on people's sofas.
Oksana wants to work and rent her own home, but while waiting for a bank account and job responses, she said she had no choice but to live in the accommodation provided for her.
Originally from Donetsk, Oksana made connections with vegans across the world and was offered a place to stay in south Wales with a friend and his family.
However, she said she was asked to leave abruptly after discussions about veganism and animal by-products, such as leather.
Since then she has been trying to find a home that caters to her needs but said it had been a challenge.
""With like 6% of Wales vegan and then those willing to take me on, my chances are probably under 1%,"" she said.
Oksana said she feels ""traumatised"" watching people eat meat.
She has said she would stay in any home she is offered, but cannot share a fridge with non-vegans or be in the room when they are cooking or eating animal products.
""I will have my own fridge I will keep in my room and I going to pay them for electricity,"" she said.
""How would it be for you if someone was cutting a child in front of you or keeping body parts in the fridge and you just see a hand or half of face? That is what it feels like for me.""
She said Caerphilly council had been ""so helpful"" and were trying to find her a family to suit her needs but said she knows it comes last due to the number of people looking for a host family.
""It's hard for people from Ukraine already because lots of people try to take advantage, renting small rooms for hundreds or in places far away from transportation,"" she said.
""And so, even a regular person it's hard but, for me, it's even harder.""
A vegan is someone who doesn't eat or use animal products.
Unlike a vegetarian diet - where people do not eat meat or fish - a vegan diet avoids all animal products like dairy, eggs and even honey, as well as meat and fish.
Some people prefer to call this way of eating 'a plant-based diet'.
Following a vegan lifestyle also means only using or buying cosmetics and clothes free from animal products.
Research by the Vegan Society found the number of vegans in Great Britain increased from 150,000 in 2006 to 540,000 in 2016.
Many believe the number of people who call themselves vegans could now be in the millions.
The charity Vegan Society said someone's veganism needs to be taken as seriously as religious and allergy requirements and it was understandable a vegan refugee would want to live ""in a plant-based household where their values and views are shared by others"".
It added: ""Being forced to leave the entire life they know behind is horrific enough, so finding somewhere they can feel safe and respected in an otherwise unfamiliar community, where they can comfortably sustain the values they hold close, shouldn't be a privilege.
""It would be great to see more available support to accommodate vegans, whose ethical beliefs fall within the protection of the law just as those with religious beliefs, so it's important their views are acknowledged and respected in the same way.""A woman who fled Ukraine has said she feels ""isolated"" after failing to find a vegan-friendly host.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61616622;2022-05-28;Ukraine round-up: Putin urged to resume talks - and a bike ride from hell;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
The leaders of France and Germany had an 80-minute phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and urged him to launch ""direct, serious negotiations"" with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz ""insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops,"" according to Germany's account of the call.
Russia's president said Moscow was open to resuming dialogue with Kyiv, according to the Kremlin.
It did not mention the possibility of direct Putin-Zelensky talks.
The Ukrainian president earlier said he was not ""eager"" for talks, but added they would likely be necessary to end the conflict.
France and Germany also urged Mr Putin to release 2,500 Ukrainian fighters who were taken as prisoners of war at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
The sprawling factory became the last holdout in the southern port city, which endured relentless bombardment from Russian forces and now lies in ruins.
Russia has previously said more than 900 of the fighters were moved to a reopened prison colony in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk. A smaller number with serious wounds were taken to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Donetsk region.
You can read more about the call here.
Also on Saturday, Russia scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, meaning people over 40 can enlist for the armed forces.
Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners.
President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
But in March Russia's defence ministry admitted that some conscripts were involved in the conflict and some had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle.
Ukrainian and Western military experts say Russia has suffered heavy losses in the war: about 30,000 killed, according to Ukraine, while the UK government estimates the toll at about 15,000. In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan were about 15,000.
Russia gave a total of 1,351 dead on 25 March, which it has not updated.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have fled to Armenia, in a bid to avoid President Putin's crackdown on dissent.
With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights to the capital Yerevan from Moscow. Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them.
Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"", and for Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, Russia no longer seemed a safe place to live.
""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said Yura. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested.""
Some Ukrainian families have spent more than three months living underground in a metro station in the country's second city of Kharkiv.
With no fresh air or access to washing facilities, disease has spread easily and people have suffered from illnesses including Covid-19, Rotavirus and heart and liver problems.
After months of intense fighting, Ukrainian forces have pushed Moscow's forces away from the city and back into Russian territory.
But the people here say intense fighting has destroyed their homes and that, despite the metro having reopened, they have nowhere else to go.
One man, 45-year-old Arif Bagirov, has told the BBC about his bike ride like no other.
He managed to flee the heavily-bombed eastern city of Severodonetsk by cycling - and dodging Russian shells and warplanes.
""There was a lot of firing, and at least two air strikes near me,"" he said, recounting his 70km (43-mile) bike ride to the city of Bakhmut.
Mr Bagirov said it was easier to avoid Russian warplanes, because he could hear them coming from a distance.
""I found a ditch to lie in, and that's where I laid until they had gone past.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-61617767;2022-05-28;Ukraine: Boris's open letter to children 'galling and hypocritical', say sponsors;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
A couple trying to sponsor a refugee boy stuck in Holland say Boris Johnson's open letter to Ukrainian children is ""galling and hypocritical"".
Seventeen-year-old Andrii has been ""in limbo"" in the Netherlands for two months with his sponsor Joseph Kleijnen due to visa processing delays.
He said he felt ""forgotten"" after Mr Johnson told the children of Ukraine ""we in the UK will never forget you"".
The government said it was ""doing all we can to support new arrivals"".
""I don't see any deeds that are actually approving what he said in that letter,"" said the teenager, whose parents are both military doctors in Ukraine.
""I haven't heard anything from the United Kingdom in the past two months.""
Mr Kleijnen, 59, who lives in Sunk Island, East Yorkshire, with his wife Jeanette, 56, added: ""[They are] very empty words.
""It would be much more helpful if Andrii and the many, many other children who are in his position would actually get their visa and be in a safe and secure place.""
Andrii fled Ukraine alone hours after bombs landed near his hometown of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, the same day the couple applied to sponsor him under the Homes4Ukraine scheme.
Mr Kleijnen flew to Amsterdam on 22 March to collect him after submitting a visa application and the pair have since been stuck in the Dutch country.
All three said they were ""fed up, frustrated and just really disillusioned with this whole process"", with Mrs Kleijnen describing it as being ""an abyss"".

Seventeen-year-old Andrii has been ""in limbo"" in the Netherlands for two months with his sponsor Joseph Kleijnen due to visa processing delays.
He said he felt ""forgotten"" after Mr Johnson told the children of Ukraine ""we in the UK will never forget you"".
The government said it was ""doing all we can to support new arrivals"".
""I don't see any deeds that are actually approving what he said in that letter,"" said the teenager, whose parents are both military doctors in Ukraine.
""I haven't heard anything from the United Kingdom in the past two months.""
Mr Kleijnen, 59, who lives in Sunk Island, East Yorkshire, with his wife Jeanette, 56, added: ""[They are] very empty words.
""It would be much more helpful if Andrii and the many, many other children who are in his position would actually get their visa and be in a safe and secure place.""
Andrii fled Ukraine alone hours after bombs landed near his hometown of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, the same day the couple applied to sponsor him under the Homes4Ukraine scheme.
Mr Kleijnen flew to Amsterdam on 22 March to collect him after submitting a visa application and the pair have since been stuck in the Dutch country.
All three said they were ""fed up, frustrated and just really disillusioned with this whole process"", with Mrs Kleijnen describing it as being ""an abyss"".
She said Wednesday was the first time they had received any communication from the Home Office, which informed them Andrii's application had ""now been passed to the decision-making centre"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61583492;2022-05-25;How can Ukraine export its harvest to the world?;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin. What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world?
In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region.
Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked.
Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound.
""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out.""
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has described as ""blackmail"" an offer from Russia to lift its blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
Ukraine punches far above its weight as a food exporter, contributing 42% of the sunflower oil traded on the global market, 16% of the maize and 9% of the wheat.
Some countries depend heavily on it. Lebanon imports 80% of its wheat from Ukraine and India 76% of its sunflower oil.
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), which feeds people on the brink of starvation in countries such as Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan, sources 40% of its wheat from the country.
Even before the war, the world's food supply was precarious. Drought affected wheat and vegetable oil crops in Canada last year, and corn and soybean yields in South America.
Covid had a big impact too. In Indonesia and Malaysia labour shortages meant lower harvests of palm oil, which pushed up vegetable oil prices globally.
At the beginning of this year, the price of many of the world's staple foods were reaching all-time highs. Many hoped that crops from Ukraine could help make up the global shortfall.
But Russia's invasion has prevented that. The Ukrainian agriculture ministry says 20 million tonnes of grain are now stuck in the country.
Before the war, 90% of Ukraine's exports left via deep ports in the Black Sea, which can load tankers large enough to travel long distances - to China or India - and still make a profit. But all are now closed. Russia has seized most of Ukraine's coastline and blockaded the rest with a fleet of at least 20 vessels, including four submarines.
WFP head David Beasley has called for the international community to organise a convoy to break this blockade.
""Without understanding from Russia, militarily there is so much that could go wrong,"" says Jonathan Bentham, maritime defence analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A convoy would require significant air, land and sea power, he says, and would be politically complicated.
""Ideally to keep tensions low, you'd ask countries on the Black Sea, such as Romania and Bulgaria, to do it. But they probably don't have the capability. Then you'd have to consider bringing in Nato members outside of the Black Sea.""
That would put Turkey, which controls the straits into the Black Sea, in a difficult position. It has already said it will restrict entry to warships.
Russia's offer to open a corridor through the Black Sea for food shipments, in return for an easing of sanctions, came as the European Union was discussing on Wednesday a fresh package of sanctions and showed no sign of changing course.
Even if the war ended tomorrow it could take months or years to render the Black Sea safe, Mr Bentham says, as Ukraine has defended its coastline with mines and strategically sunken ships.
For now, food can only be taken out of Ukraine over land or on barges via the Danube river.
Last week, the EU announced plans to help by investing billions of euros in infrastructure. But Mrs Stetsiuk's neighbour, Kees Huizinga - who owns and farms 15,000 hectares - says it's not doing enough.
He's been trying to transport goods since the start of the war, and is exasperated by the mountain of paperwork the EU requires, which he says has created queues at the border up to 25km (16 miles) long.
""It's just paper, it's not like they are actually taking samples of the corn. You just have to have the paper,"" he says.
On 18 May, two days after the EU announcement, customs authorities asked his drivers for two forms that they had never seen before. ""The border is not getting easier, on the contrary it's getting more bureaucratic,"" he says.
In the past three weeks Mr Huizinga has exported 150 tonnes of grain. He could get the same amount through the port of Odesa in a few hours.
""Open the borders,"" Mr Huizinga implores the EU, ""just let the stuff through.""
The main route out of the country now is rail. But Ukraine's rail system is wider than the EU's, which means loads have to be transferred to new wagons at the border. The average waiting time is 16 days but it can take up to 30.
Though the global conversation around food shortages is largely about wheat, most of the grain leaving Ukraine at the moment is corn. And that is for two reasons, according to Elena Neroba, Ukrainian grain analyst at the brokerage, Maxigrain.
She believes Ukrainian farmers are hesitant to sell wheat because they are haunted by the memory of the Holodomor, a famine created by Stalin in 1932 in which millions of Ukrainians died. Corn, on the other hand, is not as widely eaten in Ukraine.
The other factor, she says is demand. Europe doesn't buy much Ukrainian wheat, it's self-sufficient. And it's difficult to move this wheat on beyond the EU, as ports in Poland and Romania are not equipped to export large volumes of grain.
""By July, EU countries will be busy exporting their own summer harvests and will have even less capacity to handle Ukraine's food,"" Ms Neroba says.
Time is running out to solve the problem. Storage facilities are full and the summer harvest of wheat, barley and rapeseed is weeks away.
Mrs Stetsiuk still has about 40% of last year's harvest stored on her farm and little room for next season's.
""We don't want to waste it. We know how important it is for the West, for Africa, for Asia,"" she says. ""That's the fruit of our labour and people need it.""
If she can't sell her stock, she can't afford to plant this autumn. She hopes the international community can help finance Ukrainian farmers store grain and to plant again.
If they don't, she says, grain shortages next year will be even worse.
Many wheat crops are in particularly bad shape right now. In Central Europe, the US, India, Pakistan and North Africa, dry weather means yields are set to be low. In Ukraine by contrast, the weather for wheat has been good.
Mrs Stetsiuk started her farm with her late husband 30 years ago, as Ukraine was emerging from the ashes of the USSR. They were the first in their region to buy farmland and became a proud farming family in the process. Her two daughters and her son are all involved.
""We want to keep doing it. We want to help, providing food to the people.""
In a matter of months, she says, Russia has taken them back at least 20 years.Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin.

Russian forces have reached the outskirts of a key city in the Donbas region, Severodonetsk, which Ukraine says is under 24-hour a day bombardment as Russia attempts to take full control.
But reports that Russia controls a vital arterial road south-west of the city are untrue, a Ukrainian official has told the BBC.
""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said.
Russia now controls nearly all of Luhansk, one of two eastern regions that makes up Donbas.

The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion, writes the BBC's Jeremy Bowen.
He's been close to the front line in Donbas, hearing from civilians caught up in the fighting.
One man, Mitra, just shrugged when asked if he would accept a deal that allowed Russia to control all of Donbas.
""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive,"" he said.

Russia has a proud slogan: ""we don't abandon our own"". It is used to help justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where, according to Vladimir Putin, Russian speakers need protection from a neo-Nazi regime.
But it is Ukrainian authorities, not Russian, who are trying to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers who died on the battlefields near Kyiv.
Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back.
""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies.""
But the delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia, and the BBC has heard from several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield.
Russia has offered to provide safe passage to vessels carrying food from Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions, according to Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko cited by the Interfax news agency.
Before the invasion, Ukraine's fertile fields provided grain to countries around the world via its ports on the Black Sea. But Russia has imposed a naval blockade, making it impossible for the grain and other important food products to leave Ukraine.
The blockade is one reason for the rising food prices around the world.

Former President Donald Trump has called on US lawmakers to prioritise funding for school security over sending military aid to Ukraine.
Speaking at a pro-gun conference, Mr Trump questioned how the US ""has $40 billion to send to Ukraine"" but cannot ensure security in schools.
The meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest US gun group, is taking place in Houston.
The intervention comes days after 21 people died in a Texas school shooting.
""Before we nation-build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation,"" Mr Trump said in Friday's speech, drawing loud applause.
Earlier this month, the US Congress overwhelmingly voted to send nearly $40bn (£31bn) in military aid to Ukraine. In total, US lawmakers have sent about $54bn to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.
""Congress should vote immediately to take back every penny of unused Covid relief money,"" Mr Trump went on. ""Take it back from the states and use that money to quickly establish impenetrable security at every school all across our land.""
Mr Trump rejected calls for tightened gun controls, saying decent Americans should be allowed firearms to defend themselves against ""evil"".
He instead proposed a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of school safety, with fortified single points of entry including metal detectors and at least one armed police officer on every campus. He accused Democrats of stonewalling such security measures.
The former Republican president began his speech by reading out the names of the Uvalde shooting victims, with each marked by a bell toll.
The annual conference of the NRA, which has five million members, is taking place 280 miles (450 km) from Uvalde, the scene of the worst school shooting in the US in a decade.
Ahead of the event, several conservative speakers and musical performers announced they were backing out - including Senator John Cornyn and the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Uvalde attack.
Mr Trump hit out at those who withdrew, telling the crowd: ""Unlike some, I didn't disappoint you by not showing up.""
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who had been slated to speak in person at the event, instead told the crowd via videolink that gun laws are ineffective at preventing mass shootings.
""There are thousands of laws on the books across the country that limit the owning or using of firearms - laws that have not stopped madmen from carrying out evil acts on innocent people and peaceful communities,"" Mr Abbott said.
""In Uvalde, the gunman committed a felony under Texas law before he even pulled the trigger. It is a felony to possess a firearm on school premises. But that did not stop him.""
Mr Trump called in his speech for the US to ""drastically change our approach to mental health"".
He made a similar call during his presidency, even while critics at the time accused him of trying to defund medical programmes that included mental healthcare.
Before Mr Trump spoke, Texas Senator Ted Cruz blamed mass shootings mainly on absent fathers, declining church attendance, social media and video games.
Mr Cruz also reiterated his pro-gun stance and urged delegates ""not react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the Constitution or infringing on the rights of our law-abiding citizens"".
""If the left disarms America, those crimes would no longer be stopped,"" Mr Cruz said. ""Many more single moms in subways would be assaulted or raped or murdered. Home invasions would turn much more deadly, as only the criminals would have guns. And far more children would be murdered.""
Outside the venue, hundred of protesters gathered to oppose the NRA. They held signs saying ""NRA kill kids"", ""protect children not guns"" and held crosses and photos of shooting victims.Former President Donald Trump has called on US lawmakers to prioritise funding for school security over sending military aid to Ukraine.

A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces.
""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai.
Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target.
If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.
Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through.
Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed.
If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.
The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters.
""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said.
American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant.
""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC.
Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas.
Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"".
President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down.
The Ukrainian leader appealed to European countries to show unity in the face of Russian aggression and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the West to ""kill Russian exports"" by stopping all trade.
As well as bombarding towns and cities in the east, Russia launched its biggest missile attack yet on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia at dawn on Wednesday, killing one person and damaging more than 60 homes and a shopping centre.
In a clear statement of intent that Russia's long-term plans extend across the south, as well as eastern Ukraine, President Putin signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports.
While the region of Kherson is under Russian occupation, only parts of the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzhia are in Russian hands. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, declared on Wednesday that the entire region should become a fully-fledged part of Russia, rather than a so-called people's republic.
Occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk became proxy republics after they were captured in 2014 and Russia has already handed out 800,000 passports there.A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces.
""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai.
Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target.
If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.
Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through.
Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed.
If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.
The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters.
""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said.
American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant.
""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC.
Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas.
Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"".
President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down.

European governments should ""stay strong"" even though the Ukraine war would hurt their economies, the Klitschko brothers told the BBC.
Former heavyweight champions Wladimir and Vitali were in Davos to encourage world leaders to support the Ukraine's fight against Russia.
They acknowledged that some European leaders may be wavering in their commitment to the cause.
But they thanked the UK for its support, urging, “please don’t stop"".
Ukraine’s Klitschko brothers dominated the sport of boxing for a decade. Both were world heavyweight champions, and between them they fought 40 title bouts.
Vitali Klitschko, the older of the two, turned to politics when his boxing career ended, and was elected mayor of Kyiv in 2014.
They are now bringing the power of their global fame to bear on another, even tougher fight. The brothers visited the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to urge the business and political leaders gathered there to step up their efforts in the struggle against Russian aggression.
“We are asking for help and support, we are getting some of it. But it is not enough because it’s never enough as long as this war is still going,” Wladimir Klitschko told the BBC.
Sanctions needed to go further, he said. “We need to walk the talk and not just say it but actually do it. Because very often it’s sad but in reality it’s not working.
""And that is why it is important to isolate Russia financially, economically, because every cent that they are getting is getting in the budgets to finance the war in Ukraine right now and finance their soldiers and buy more weapons that are killing us, Ukrainians.”
Wladimir told assembled reporters from the Swiss press that the country should set aside its long-standing tradition of neutrality, which has seen it prohibit Germany from supplying its stocks of Swiss-made ammunition to Ukrainian army.
The Klitschkos were at Davos town hall to meet a group of Ukrainian refugees who are staying in the area, before appearing on stage at the World Economic Forum.
Asked whether some nations, notably France and Germany, were beginning to waver in their support, and consider making concessions to Putin in a peace deal, Wladimir said: “I see that, and I tell to every politician, right now the world [is] black and white, and you have to decide: you on the side of democracy or peace, or you on the side of the dictator, the aggressors, Russian Federation?”
Vitali acknowledged that the world would pay a price to support Ukraine. “It is a very painful question for the economy but we pay to stop the war…with human lives.”
The brothers both thanked the British people for the support they have shown.
“I want to say thank you so much for all the support that has been provided since the beginning of the war,” said Wladimir. “And it is not just verbally, it is the financial side, military equipment, support for the refugees that have been taken, so we feel this it is very important for us. Please don’t stop, don’t stop supporting us don’t stop helping us as long as this war is still going.”

""Liar! Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage. Grey-haired trade unionists held signs that read ""no weapons, no war"".
Usually a workers' rights demonstration in Düsseldorf would be a cosy affair for a chancellor from the centre-left Social Democrats. But these left-wing activists were outraged that his government was sending weapons to Ukraine.
""It's cynical to tell Ukrainians they should defend themselves against Putin's aggression without weapons,"" he shouted back, battling to make himself heard over the booing.
However vocal, these German unionists are in a minority. Home and abroad, Mr Scholz has come under attack for not sending Ukraine enough weapons.
Leading politicians from across Germany's political spectrum accuse Mr Scholz of acting as a brake on arms deliveries.
Poland's President Andrzej Duda has accused Berlin of breaking its word, saying that modern German Leopard tanks, promised by Berlin to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent to Ukraine, have not arrived.
Internationally there is a perception that Germany does not want to arm Ukraine.
""I don't understand why it's so complicated,"" said a frustrated Ukrainian foreign minister this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser went on social media to plead for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS).
In reality Berlin is supplying large amounts of weapons; not as much as the US, but comparable to other European countries. Experts say Germany ranks somewhere in the middle.
The German parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of supplying heavy weapons. Most mainstream politicians and almost all parties support the move, including Olaf Scholz's own Social Democrat SPD, his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal FDP, as well as the conservative opposition.
The far-right AfD and radical left-wing Die Linke are the only parties to object to arming Ukraine. Both are struggling in the polls and are fractured by internal spats.
There have been objections to weapons deliveries in the media debate, such as a public letter written by some academics and media personalities. But none of the signatories have political influence, and few have any expertise on Russia or Ukraine.
And yet, despite the consensus in the political mainstream, Mr Scholz still appears hesitant.
In speeches he repeats set phrases like ""Putin must not win, Ukraine must exist"". Inexplicably he never talks about Ukraine winning the war.
Unlike many leading German politicians, he still hasn't visited Kyiv since Russia's invasion, saying that going for a ""photo-op"" is pointless.
This has sparked outrage in Germany, with photos shared on social media of Mr Scholz shaking hands with various dignitaries all over the world, clearly for photo-ops.
On the one hand Mr Scholz pledges full support for Ukraine. On the other, the security council that he chairs hasn't signed off requests for modern Leopard or Marder tanks which suppliers say they could send and which Ukraine wants.
This week Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliament's defence committee and defence expert for the liberal FDP, a party in Scholz's own governing coalition, said it was unacceptable that Germany was seen in the world as putting the brakes on military help for Ukraine ""simply because we're not able to communicate properly and organise ourselves"".
She wants a transparent list of what Germany is delivering and better coordination, saying the chancellor ""can pull all the strings"" when it comes to arms deliveries. ""I'm trying to understand why he doesn't. Is out of conviction or because of his party?""
Certainly in polls, Social Democrat voters are some of the most likely to oppose arming Ukraine. The SPD traditionally believes peace in Europe can only be achieved by working with, not against Moscow. Some influential party figures would rather focus on a peace deal with Vladimir Putin and believe sending weapons to Ukraine might escalate the conflict.
Overall the public mood is divided, febrile and changeable:
Either way people are confused.
Until recently Mr Scholz said sending tanks would mean escalation and that Germany didn't have enough tanks to send anyway.
Then he said tanks could be sent to Poland, but those don't seem to have arrived and it's not clear what the agreement was anyway. Now the message is that Berlin is sending Gepard defensive tanks directly to Ukraine, but not Leopard or Marder offensive tanks, because of a supposed informal agreement with Nato.
Other countries don't seem to have such fraught public rows about the details of arms deliveries.
But the lack of clarity is making people increasingly nervous and undermining trust in Mr Scholz's leadership. His ratings are falling and his SPD party has lost two major state elections in the last month.
His aim appears to be a conciliatory middle ground of compromise to avoid escalation, understandable given Germany's traumatic war-torn 20th Century. But the danger is that by trying to keep everyone happy, Mr Scholz satisfies no-one - least of all Ukraine.""Liar! Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage.

Preparations were under way for a pop-up Russian wedding in the courtyard of a disused textile factory in the remote Armenian town of Tumanyan. Most of the guests were artists and musicians who had fled Russia.
Bride and groom Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, moved here to escape Russia's crackdown on anti-war protesters.
""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said the bridegroom. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested.""
Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence, for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"".
Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have come here.
With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights here from Moscow. The two countries have long-standing ties. Armenia is Russia's strategic ally in the South Caucasus region and hosts a Russian military base as well as being part of the Russian-led security alliance CSTO.
Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them.
After his detention, strange, anti-government messages appeared on Yura's phone as the couple were preparing to board their flight to the capital, Yerevan.
Yura was well aware that Russia's FSB security service had been ordering people to unlock their phones to reveal personal messages and contacts. He feared the messages may have been an attempt to incriminate him, but he made it through security without being stopped.
As the guests brought out tables and erected gazebos, the bride's mother, Valeriya Kiselyova, revealed that back in Russia her husband had stopped a car with the letter Z emblazoned on its windscreen - one of the propaganda symbols of the invasion.
""He took out a shovel and ordered them to rip it off. I realised then that we had to leave to avoid being imprisoned,"" she said.
Wedding guest Polina Prokofyeva described spending 12 days in a prison cell for taking part in an anti-war rally in St Petersburg.
""The whole process was so humiliating, they try to make you feel that you are nobody and your voice means nothing,"" she said. After a three-minute court hearing, she said she was convicted of taking part in resisting Russia's so-called special military operation.
Many Russian emigres here are IT specialists who see Armenia as a practical place to resettle.
The arrival of tens of thousands of highly skilled Russian citizens will have a positive impact on Armenia's economy, says Haykaz Fanyan of the Armenian Centre for Socioeconomic Studies.
""In March, Armenia's accommodation and food services sector recorded growth of 230% and 30% compared with the same period last year. Relocated Russians established 1,500 enterprises, of which 300 are companies and the rest are private entrepreneurs.""
Among them was Dima, a 34-year Muscovite, who has just opened a cafe serving Israeli and Korean food. ""At the beginning of March the centre of Yerevan looked like the centre of Moscow, there were so many Russians,"" he said. ""They looked lost and didn't know what to do.""
He had been considering leaving Russia even before the war.
""We've been losing our freedom for some time, now it's dangerous for me to go back because two years ago I posted some anti-government message on Facebook, I could be jailed for it now.""
Sitting at his cafe were a young couple.
""I served in a regular army for a year, and now I'd have to serve again as there was mobilisation,"" says video games developer Sergei. ""I didn't want to be jailed for avoiding military service, but I also did not want to kill innocent people, so I decided to leave.""
He is ashamed of once voting for Vladimir Putin while serving in the army in return for more food: ""I sold my country for two gingerbread cookies.""
His partner Anya, an English tutor, dropped out of her third year at university when her head of department declared that Ukrainians deserved what Russia was inflicting on them.
""It opened my eyes, I could not believe it that those responsible for teaching could say such things, that it was right to kill someone and that it was not right to say anything against it.""
Russian state TV has not just spread propaganda and disinformation about the war in Ukraine, it has also reported on riots in Armenia that never happened.
Anya said she had to reassure her mother that recent anti-government protests had been largely peaceful: ""I checked the reports she was talking about and found out that Russian TV used footage from riots in France.""
Opposition protesters set up a tent city, demanding Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's resignation over territory lost to neighbouring Azerbaijan during a 2020 war.
Here too, Kremlin disinformation has found a ready audience, as most Armenians speak Russian.
""We are for Russia, the Russians are our brothers,"" said one female protester. Others gathered around, voicing their support.
Vardan Makhitaryan picks up the conversation: ""We don't want this democracy that destroyed the strong Armenian army, and Russia does not want it either. Why is the whole world looking at Russia with wolf eyes? Russia did not attack Ukraine, it is just defending itself.""
Sentiments like these may be of concern for recent Russian arrivals who oppose the war against Ukraine, and Polina Prokofyeva fears Armenia may not be the safe haven that dissidents need.
She points out that some hotels have been asked by police to hand over data of their Russian guests. ""Just talking to people in Yerevan, I feel they don't really get what's going on and they're on the side of my government which punished me and all my friends,"" she said.

Ukrainian troops could withdraw from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces are close to surrounding, an official there says.
Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russians were in part of the city. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave.""
Russia has made seizing the whole eastern Donbas region a key war aim.
Ukraine is pleading for long-range weaponry to resist Russia's advance, but the US has so far not offered it.
On Friday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine needed long-range multiple-launch rocket systems.
""I'm afraid that Putin, at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas,"" he told Bloomberg.
""He's continuing to make gradual, slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily.""
In Severodonetsk Mr Haidai said more than half the housing had been destroyed and almost all buildings there had been damaged. All remaining residents were in shelters.
The road out of the city to Ukraine-held territory was under constant fire but still passable, he added.
Also on Friday, pro-Russian forces seized the town of Lyman to the west of Severodonetsk, setting the scene for an advance towards the major cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.
By BBC Digital Europe Editor Paul Kirby
Seizing Lyman represents a significant moment in the slow advance of Russia's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. The battle for the city has been intense, even if Ukrainian forces started pulling back from it earlier this week. It's the second major success for Russia this week, following the fall of Svitlodarsk further south.
Lyman is not a big city in itself, but it gives Russia's proxies control of a key east-west road. It also means they are now within 20km (12 miles) of the city of Slovyansk, to the south-west. Slovyansk is a major transport and supply hub for Ukraine, even though the trains stopped running there weeks ago.
The other big battle is further to the east, where Russian forces are targeting the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. These are important cities in Ukraine's industrial heartland known as Donbas and losing them would be a significant blow for the army.
Away from the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks during a call with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.
According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin also denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports was to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause was sanctions imposed by the US and the EU.
The UN has warned that Russia's invasion could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years. It has reduced global supplies of cereals such as maize and wheat as well as cooking oil and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN.
Meanwhile the Moscow branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church says it is cutting ties with Russia because of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch's support for the war.
""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow... on the war,"" the Church said in a statement. It also declared the ""full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.""
Ukraine is highly significant for Russia's Orthodox Church and is home to many important monasteries. Part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had already broken away from Moscow in 2019.Ukrainian troops could withdraw from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces are close to surrounding, an official there says.
Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russians were in part of the city. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave.""
Russia has made seizing the whole eastern Donbas region a key war aim.
Ukraine is pleading for long-range weaponry to resist Russia's advance, but the US has so far not offered it.
On Friday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine needed long-range multiple-launch rocket systems.
""I'm afraid that Putin, at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas,"" he told Bloomberg.
""He's continuing to make gradual, slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily.""
In Severodonetsk Mr Haidai said more than half the housing had been destroyed and almost all buildings there had been damaged. All remaining residents were in shelters.
The road out of the city to Ukraine-held territory was under constant fire but still passable, he added.
Also on Friday, pro-Russian forces seized the town of Lyman to the west of Severodonetsk, setting the scene for an advance towards the major cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.

Seizing Lyman represents a significant moment in the slow advance of Russia's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. The battle for the city has been intense, even if Ukrainian forces started pulling back from it earlier this week. It's the second major success for Russia this week, following the fall of Svitlodarsk further south.
Lyman is not a big city in itself, but it gives Russia's proxies control of a key east-west road. It also means they are now within 20km (12 miles) of the city of Slovyansk, to the south-west. Slovyansk is a major transport and supply hub for Ukraine, even though the trains stopped running there weeks ago.

Moscow is attempting to encircle two cities in the east of Ukraine, in Luhansk.
The cities, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, straddle a key river and taking control of them would mean Russia would be closer to its goal of taking the whole of the Luhansk region.
And with no sign of an end to the fighting, two senior Russian officials signalled on Tuesday that Moscow was ready for a prolonged war. ""We are not rushing to meet deadlines,"" one said.

The war in Ukraine has highlighted how countries need to put values before profits, Nato's chief has warned.
Jens Stoltenberg said it had shown ""how economic relations with authoritarian regimes can create vulnerabilities"".
His speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos singled out trade with Russia and China in particular.
Mr Stoltenberg pointed to issues such as Russia's dominance over Europe's gas supply, as well as bids from Chinese companies to run 5G networks.
""International trade has undoubtedly brought great prosperity but we must recognise that our economic choices have consequences for our security,"" the former Norwegian prime minister told people gathered at the event.
""Freedom is more important than free trade. The protection of our values is more important than profit.""
He said the fact European countries could buy as much gas as they wanted from Moscow was ""wrong"" and ""dangerous"".
""It provides Russia with a tool to intimidate and to use against us, and that has been clearly demonstrated now, I regret to say.""
Europe has been accused of helping fund Moscow's war in Ukraine through its payment for energy, and is currently taking steps to reduce its reliance on Russian gas imports by two thirds by the end of 2022.
Meanwhile, Russia has cut off gas and electricity supplies to Finland since it announced its ambition to join Nato. Poland and Bulgaria have also seen their gas supplies cut off after refusing to pay in Russian roubles.
Mr Stoltenberg also noted that new 5G networks were part of countries' ""critical infrastructure"" and control of the networks was ""of vital security importance"".
""We cannot say that in the interest of profits and free trade we just open up those networks also for suppliers that actually are not reliable when it comes to our security,"" he said.
Fears have been raised in recent years over Chinese companies' involvement in telecoms networks.
The UK, US, Australia and New Zealand have already placed bans on China's biggest telecoms equipment makers getting involved in 5G networks.

Boris Johnson has called for more military support for Ukraine, as it battles Russian forces in the east of the country.
The prime minister said Russian troops are ""continuing to chew through ground"" in the Donbas region, making ""slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress.""
Thousands of frontline Ukrainian troops are now using weapons and other equipment supplied by the UK.
The government says it is spending £1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine.
So what exactly is being sent, and how much of a difference is it making?
The UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine.
Nlaws are designed to destroy tanks at short range with a single shot.
Crucially for Ukraine's armed forces who need weapons immediately, the missiles are easy to transport and simple to use. A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day.
Many analysts believe they have already had a major impact on the course of the conflict.
""Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,"" says Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute.
The weapons have been ""particularly effective"" when used in combination with artillery, he says.
He points to successful strikes on tank columns, where Nlaws have destroyed the front vehicles, trapping those to the rear for targeting with artillery.
Defence Minister James Heappey confirmed that ""hundreds"" of Brimstone missiles would be sent to Ukraine on 28 April.
Brimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.
The missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.
Launching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.
If used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.
""It all depends where you hit,"" he says. ""If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.""
Britain has donated 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.
Mastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.
Analysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.
It is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively, often to force enemy vehicles into areas where they can be targeted with anti-tank weaponry.
The Ministry of Defence says it is supplying ""dozens"" of heavy lift unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces.
Analysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the ""last mile"" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement.
While Russia has so far failed to encircle large numbers of Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine, the threat of artillery fire in some areas is ever-present.
""It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,"" says Mr Bronk. ""Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger.""
Britain says it has donated five air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.
Starstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.
It ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.
""From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,"" says Mr Bronk. ""There's very little you can do about it.""
He says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.
However,  Starstreak requires much more training than systems such as Nlaw, and is no substitute, say analysts, for longer-range air defence systems.
Britain is also supplying a ""small number"" of tracked Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.
Sustaining supplies of Western equipment, weapons and ammunition will be extremely important to the Ukrainians in the longer term, according to retired Brig Ben Barry, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
He says that although Ukraine has some weapons manufacturing capacity of its own, it will be difficult for its troops to take significant territory back from Russian forces without substantial outside support.
Military professionals point out that Ukraine's need is largely for equipment which its troops already know how to use, or can be trained on very quickly.
Much of Ukraine's weaponry was designed and manufactured in former Warsaw Pact eastern European countries.
For this reason, the UK has offered to send British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill its donations of T-72 tanks to Ukraine.
Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew.
In the days shortly before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, UK ministers insisted that supplies to Ukraine would be confined to ""defensive"" weapons.
That means weapons which can only be used to defend Ukraine from attack, and not to attack Russia.
The government has signalled that it is moving away from purely defensive supplies, but some experts question the whole distinction.
""There is no such thing as a purely defensive weapon,"" says Brig Barry. ""Defensive weapons are also offensive, because they can defend equipment being used to mount an attack.""
Other equipment supplied by the UK includes:

Many analysts believe they have already had a major impact on the course of the conflict.
""Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,"" says Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute.
The weapons have been ""particularly effective"" when used in combination with artillery, he says.
He points to successful strikes on tank columns, where Nlaws have destroyed the front vehicles, trapping those to the rear for targeting with artillery.
Defence Minister James Heappey confirmed that ""hundreds"" of Brimstone missiles would be sent to Ukraine on 28 April.
Brimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.
The missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.
Launching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.
If used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.
""It all depends where you hit,"" he says. ""If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.""
Britain has donated 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.
Mastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.
Analysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.
It is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively, often to force enemy vehicles into areas where they can be targeted with anti-tank weaponry.
The Ministry of Defence says it is supplying ""dozens"" of heavy lift unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces.
Analysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the ""last mile"" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement.
While Russia has so far failed to encircle large numbers of Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine, the threat of artillery fire in some areas is ever-present.
""It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,"" says Mr Bronk. ""Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger.""
Britain says it has donated five air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.
Starstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.
It ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.
""From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,"" says Mr Bronk. ""There's very little you can do about it.""
He says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.
However,  Starstreak requires much more training than systems such as Nlaw, and is no substitute, say analysts, for longer-range air defence systems.
Britain is also supplying a ""small number"" of tracked Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.
Sustaining supplies of Western equipment, weapons and ammunition will be extremely important to the Ukrainians in the longer term, according to retired Brig Ben Barry, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
He says that although Ukraine has some weapons manufacturing capacity of its own, it will be difficult for its troops to take significant territory back from Russian forces without substantial outside support.
Military professionals point out that Ukraine's need is largely for equipment which its troops already know how to use, or can be trained on very quickly.
Much of Ukraine's weaponry was designed and manufactured in former Warsaw Pact eastern European countries.
For this reason, the UK has offered to send British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill its donations of T-72 tanks to Ukraine.
Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew.
In the days shortly before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, UK ministers insisted that supplies to Ukraine would be confined to ""defensive"" weapons.
That means weapons which can only be used to defend Ukraine from attack, and not to attack Russia.
The government has signalled that it is moving away from purely defensive supplies, but some experts question the whole distinction.
""There is no such thing as a purely defensive weapon,"" says Brig Barry. ""Defensive weapons are also offensive, because they can defend equipment being used to mount an attack.""
Other equipment supplied by the UK includes:

A court in Ukraine has jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the conflict began.
Ukraine says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes, However, the Russian government denies it has been targeting civilians.
The International Criminal Court has also sent a team of investigators and forensics experts to the country.
It may not seem like it, but ""even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it.
These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements.
Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival.
Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons.
The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war.
Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or, in some circumstances, ""genocide"".
The 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin admitted shooting 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the head, a few days after the invasion began.
Sentencing Shishimarin, the judge said he had committed ""a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order"" and that only a life sentence was appropriate.
Ukraine is preparing cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offences including killing civilians, rape, bombing civilian infrastructure and looting.
US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both accused Russia of carrying out war crimes in Ukraine.
Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, and other nearby areas.
Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.
In March, a Russian strike on a theatre in Mariupol appeared to be the first confirmed location of a mass killing. The word ""children"" was written in giant letters outside the building.
Ukraine previously called Russia's air strike on Mariupol's hospital a war crime.
Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of ""aggressive warfare"".
There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia.
A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Today, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) both have roles upholding the rules of war.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states, but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia.
If the ICJ ruled against Russia, the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that.
But Russia - one of council's five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states.
It's the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg, which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945.
Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up special courts to uphold international law.
The ICC's chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan QC, believes there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine.
Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013, before Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
If there's evidence, the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague.
However the court doesn't have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects - and since Russia is not a member of the court it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.
It's far easier to pin a war crime on the soldier who commits it, than the leader who ordered it.
Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch - an organisation with expertise in gathering evidence of war crimes in conflicts - agrees there is evidence of summary executions and other grave abuses by Russian forces.
He says establishing the ""chain of command"" is very important for any future trials - including whether a leader authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it.
The ICC can also prosecute the offence of ""waging aggressive war"". This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict, beyond justifiable military action in self-defence.
It originated at Nuremberg, after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for ""crimes against peace"".
However, Professor Philippe Sands QC, an expert on international law at University College London, says the ICC couldn't prosecute Russia's leaders for this because the country isn't a signatory to the court.
In theory, the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again, Russia could veto this.

A British man who fled Kyiv with his family says his Ukrainian wife is in distress because her therapy dog has been stuck in quarantine for weeks.
Mike Haley, 61, fled the war-torn country with his wife Alla, 51, and her 81-year-old mother Valentyna.
They travelled more than 2,000 miles with Pomeranian Archie, who helps Mrs Haley manage panic attacks.
But the couple, now in Newcastle, said red tape over vaccination issues meant the dog could not join them.
Mr Haley, originally from Jarrow, had been working as an English teacher and translator when the war started in February.
The family sheltered in the corridor of their apartment for eight days - during which time Mr Haley was kicked down a flight of a stairs and his friend was shot - before they got a train out of Kyiv.
After travelling via Poland to Amsterdam they sailed to North Shields with Archie, who they said helped keep their spirits up by giving them ""something else to focus on"".
But on arriving in the UK, the dog was held by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, they said.
Officials said although he had been microchipped and vaccinated there was a technical problem with his rabies inoculation, which happened before he was chipped, the couple said.
The body, overseen by Defra, ensures animals coming in to the UK are rabies-free and Archie was given a second inoculation after he arrived.
The Haleys said they were worried about whether having two doses close together would be safe because Archie is a small dog.
They said he had so far been held - 240 miles away in Aberdeen - for seven weeks and they were having difficulty finding out what is going on.
Mr Haley said the uncertainty was ""like torture"" for his wife and was making her sick.
""We came 2,000 miles with him,"" he said.
""He was given a clean bill of health in Holland and checked over - we'd made sure he'd had all his vaccinations.
""This little dog gave positive emotions to everybody, and then he was just taken away when we arrived.
""This is torment.""
A Defra spokesman said they could not discuss individual cases but said: ""We have increased resources and streamlined processes to ensure those fleeing Ukraine and entering the UK are not delayed by bringing their pets.
""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times and lower-risk animals are being moved into isolation.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61575387;2022-05-26;Ukraine war: World Bank boss warns over global recession;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
The head of the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as the price of food, energy and fertiliser jump.
David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"".
He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown.
His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract.
""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast.
""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added.
Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%.
GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of economic growth. It is one of the most important ways of measuring how well, or badly, an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces.
Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates.
Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas.
That's even as Western nations push ahead with plans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.
He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region.
He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.
Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said.
Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"".
""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said.
""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added.
Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns.
""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopened… the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time.""
Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai.
The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country.
In recent weeks, official figures have shown that large parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided.
It's the first visit from a senior royal to the region since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The latest figures show almost a million Ukrainians have already crossed the border into Romania.
Prince Charles visited a centre near Bucharest, which supports a rising number of refugees.
""It's a nightmare situation,"" the prince said to Ukrainian families who were collecting supplies of food and clothing.
He said to ""keep praying"" and told them he was ""full of admiration for the Ukrainian people - their extraordinary courage and resilience"".
Aid workers explained the scale of the pressures.
More than six million people have left Ukraine in the three months of the war. In the past week alone, a further 40,000 people are estimated to have crossed into Romania.
Prince Charles has been strongly outspoken about the war, attacking the ""brutal aggression"" inflicted on Ukraine. Having travelled to Bucharest, about 150 miles from the Ukraine border - this is also the closest a senior British royal has come to the conflict.
The prince also has a long-standing connection with Romania, having set up a charitable foundation in the country and restored a traditional farmhouse.
The visit comes as figures from the UNHCR show 966,000 Ukrainians have entered Romania since the start of the war, with only Poland taking in more refugees.
""I've not seen anything so big and so fast. By any measure it's a major movement of people,"" says Mike Weickert, global rapid response director for World Vision, a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees in Romania.
""It's going to be increasingly difficult for refugees and for the hosting countries,"" said Mr Weickert, whose aid agency is working in the Romexpo centre, visited by Prince Charles and Margareta, head of Romania's royal family.
The conference centre site is helping more than 1,000 people a day, with Romanian authorities and international agencies providing food, clothing and advice services.
Among those helping with the international effort at the centre is Stephen Noble of the Salvation Army.
He spent the pandemic helping with a food bank in Scarborough, and there are some similarities to the services being offered here, with food parcels available and racks of second-hand clothing.
There are soft toys for children and pet food for the dogs and cats that some families brought with them.
Mr Noble has been struck by the dignity of those arriving, who had to leave everything behind - and says that for those in the UK who have made donations it is ""absolutely worthwhile"".
He says one of the most practical ways of supporting refugees has been to give them vouchers, worth about £10, to use in local supermarkets, which allows them to buy for their individual needs.
One of the translators is herself a refugee. Lisa has gone from being a sales manager in Odessa to helping disorientated new arrivals.
""At first it's a shock. You don't believe it. Then you realise you have to stay."" So many people have left Ukraine that in some villages there is only one person left, she says.
For those refugees continuing to stream across the border into Romania, by car, bus or train, there is still a generous reception.
At Bucharest's Gara de Nord train station there are volunteers and support workers waiting to help families escaping the war.
Romania has given Ukrainian refugees free travel on its railways, with women and children the great majority of new arrivals. On the station concourse there are tents ready to provide immediate shelter and first aid.
This is a refugee crisis in a highly-mobile, urban setting.
Many are moving on to other countries, some will try to return to Ukraine, and those that stay in Romania are mostly in the bigger cities, with spaces having to be found in hostels, private houses, public buildings or hotel rooms.
As well as emergency needs, such as food and shelter, aid workers say they will need to provide longer-term support for refugees.
Children will need schools, adults will need jobs to have an income, older people with health problems will need access to medical support and there will be mental health problems from such a traumatic uprooting.
The longer refugees are out of their homes the more they risk ""running out money, running out of options"", says Mr Weickert.The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided.

When their dogs started digging insistently at a spot in the woods, villagers in Zavalivka called in the authorities.
A Ukrainian military team were soon at the scene in white protective suits, carefully removing the topsoil.
They uncovered a man's body, face down with his legs oddly twisted beneath him. It was clear from his uniform that he was a Russian soldier.
Weeks after they failed to seize Ukraine's capital, the remains of Russian troops are still being discovered in and around the villages they passed through or occupied near the capital, Kyiv. But Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back.
From the grave in the woods, the body was removed to a refrigerated train on the outskirts of Kyiv that now operates as a mobile morgue for the Russian dead.
The white plastic sacks are marked with numbers rather than names and there were at least 137 stacked inside two carriages on the day we visited.
The Ukrainians attempt to identify the dead: on the body just brought in, the forensics team turned up two bank cards, as well as badges for a Russian motorised rifle brigade.
""At least this one has a chance of getting home,"" the man in charge announced, displaying the finds, including a soiled fragment of T-shirt printed with the Army of Russia logo.
Moments later, I confirmed that the man I had just seen exhumed had been a young, married soldier from Siberia. Next to his body bag, a carefully posed black-and-white photograph from his social media profile stared out from my phone.
Russia has a proud slogan: ""We don't abandon our own."" It's a big part of President Vladimir Putin's supposed justification for invading Ukraine, where he falsely claimed Russian-speakers needed protection.
That pledge appears not to apply so much to Russia's own soldiers.
""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies.""
We don't actually know how the young soldier in the woods came to be abandoned. The villagers in Zavalivka say they were mostly hiding in their cellars from shelling at the time - they assume he was injured and got lost as his unit was forced to retreat.
From what we've learned of the Russian troops fighting around Kyiv, many were young and inexperienced. It's likely they were fleeing under fire.
""We did do one swap,"" Col Liamzin says, explaining that the Russian side provided a shortlist of the dead soldiers it wanted returned.
""We're ready to give them all back, we want our own dead returned too. We knock on every door there is, but there is no response, no dialogue,"" the colonel says.
The delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia.
Neither side in this war is open about the number of casualties suffered. We've spoken to several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield.
One woman, who was told of her husband's death by the men in his unit, said she had been trying to recover his body for almost three months.
But the Russian dead are being discovered here all the time.
Just up the road from Zavalivka in Sytnyaky, the village elder told us at least 10 Russian soldiers were killed and left behind in March, probably more.
Their column was ambushed after they lost their way: the locals had removed and switched the traffic signs.
The battle was fierce. What was once a roadside restaurant at the spot is now a heap of rubble, a bit of wall and a giant aquarium that somehow survived the assault.
Leaflets in the ruins call on Russian soldiers to surrender and save their lives, and spare the blood of Ukrainian children.
The village elder says he and others buried the Russians after the battle ""for sanitary reasons"". When I look quizzical, he says most were blown to pieces.
He wasn't allowed to show us the graves: they constitute a crime scene until Col Liamzin's team can get round to visiting and exhuming the site. But his dig-list is already long.
A local man planting beetroot confirms that the Russians were killed along the main road.
""It's not humane to abandon a soldier, not to bury them,"" Mikola says, leaning on his spade. His own son is in Ukraine's army.
""My wife felt sorry for the Russians at first, but then we found out what they did here,"" he adds, referring to the shooting of unarmed civilians in places like Bucha and Irpin.
""No-one feels sorry for the Russians after that.""
The burned wrecks of Russian tanks still line all the main roads into Kyiv. Every few seconds, cars stop and families spill out to take photographs, children clambering over the top.
It seems somehow cathartic. The other day, I watched a man working out by lifting a tank barrel up and down, over his head, as though he was doing weights.
But that same day, just a few steps across the road, we spotted human remains on a scorched patch of verge - a charred piece of spine and a fragment of foot - and a sweet, deathly smell when the wind dropped. It was most likely one of the men killed in one of the nearby tanks.
So the refrigerated train in Kyiv is still filling up, and there are more in other cities close to the fighting. For the Ukrainian military who recover and store the bodies, there is little sympathy: the dead are enemy soldiers - invaders.
But in Russia, someone, somewhere must be looking for each one of them.

Imagine being a coal miner, descending into a deep, ageing, rickety mineshaft.
Then imagine doing that in a war zone.
""It's scary, but what can you do? We don't have many other options,"" said Ukrainian nurse Ira Yusko, 30, smiling grimly, as she switched on her headlamp at the Toretsk coal mine in the eastern Donbas region.
Around her, more than a dozen miners - their faces already smeared with grime - shuffled forwards in the dark towards a rattling iron elevator that stood waiting to take the group 800 metres underground for a six-hour shift.
""We try to be positive. But it's hard on the soul. Depressing. These are terrible times. It's sad at home too - my wife is gone,"" said Vitaly Vahorder. He's spent half his life working at the Toretsk mine. His family recently joined the exodus heading west to safer locations.
Outside, the occasional boom and crunch of artillery fire echoed across the wheat fields from the front lines 4km to the east and south, where Russian troops are struggling to gain ground against fierce Ukrainian resistance in Donbas.
""People go down the mine knowing they may not come back up. And when you do come back up, anything can happen - the town is constantly being bombed,"" said Anatoly Sholokhov, deputy head of Toretsk's coal miners' association, as he watched the elevator door slide shut. The 69-year-old miner was born in the town and was once its mayor.
The coal mines, their steep-sided slag heaps dotting the horizon like dark pyramids, have been a defining feature of eastern Ukraine for well over a century. They provided the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Union, with much of its raw energy. But the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the past eight years of separatist conflict with pro-Russian militias, and the Kremlin's new offensive have combined to force most of the mines to close.
One of many concerns today is that the latest mine closures are happening abruptly, and without proper safety measures, causing old shafts to flood with highly toxic water that threatens to poison local rivers.
""The danger comes when you stop several mines at once,"" said Anatoly. ""You can't control where the ground water goes. It would be a disaster if it comes to the surface. This whole area would become uninhabitable. So, an ecological crisis looms over our town. May God prevent these mines from stopping. If the work stops and water begins to flood the mines, it could cause a catastrophe,""
Only two mines are still working here in Toretsk - formerly called Dzerzhynsk in honour of the founder of the Communist secret police.
Driving in from the west, past Ukrainian army checkpoints and roadblocks and into the near-empty town with its Soviet-era architecture and monuments, is like stepping back into the past. A Soviet red star still clings to the top of one of the oldest towers at the Toretsk mine, which first began producing coal in the 1930s, and was badly damaged during World War Two. The mine appears to have experienced few improvements, or even licks of paint, since it was refurbished in 1955.
One sunny morning last week, staff showed visitors around the site. Giant pieces of rusting machinery sat beside doodle-like swirls of rail track, where a lone female worker was busy pushing mine carts into a wooden shed by hand. Two giant slag heaps behind the mine were partially covered with trees and undergrowth. A huge tree grew through one ancient winding wheel. Overhead, floorboards creaked ominously as staff walked along a footbridge from the shaft back to the communal shower block - currently without water, like the rest of the town, due to blockages on a nearby canal which locals blamed on the war.
""There's no water anywhere in this town. You go to the toilet - but how do you flush? When it rains, everyone in our apartment block goes out to collect rainwater,"" said Vitaly.
Only a third of the mine's staff have stayed on in the town since the Russian offensive began earlier this year - some out of loyalty to the mine itself, but mostly for financial reasons.
""I've been working here for twenty years. I went straight to the mines after school. We don't have any other professions here. No factories. We earn 8,000 to 10,000 hryvnias a month (£220 - £275, $275 - $343) and with the current prices that's nothing, tiny, no better than a student's stipend,"" said Yuri Podlutsky.
As a group, the miners appeared reluctant to pass judgement on the war or President Putin directly. Many of them are Russian-speaking and appeared keen to avoid territory that could cause frictions within a tight-knit community. But several men acknowledged a strong nostalgia for the Soviet era and the times when Ukrainians and Russians worked side by side in the mines.
""Whether you want Putin or not, we still need to live and work. There are a lot of 'Soviets' here,"" said Vitaly. ""I consider myself simply a local. Some of us speak Russian as our first language. But we all share the same sky.""Imagine being a coal miner, descending into a deep, ageing, rickety mineshaft.

The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion.
It could be fighting a losing battle in Luhansk, the northern part of Donbas region.
The Ukrainian General Staff says the Russians appear to be concentrating their forces for another push.
In the last day the Russians have intensified their attacks across the Donbas front line - getting closer to completing the encirclement of Severodonetsk, a city of 80,000 before the invasion.
The Ukrainians, as usual, are fighting with stubborn determination. Reinforcements are being poured into the battle.
In just a few minutes I saw about 20 armoured personnel carriers, with soldiers riding on them, driving to the front line - along with tanks on transporters and multiple rocket launchers.
They have slowed the Russians down but have not stopped the offensive grinding forward. The Russians are inflicting heavy casualties.
A military source in the 57th Brigade told me that one of their units went into the line with 240 men and came out with about 140 - the rest of them killed, wounded and captured.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Russians could be killing up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers a day in Donbas.
Not far from Severodonetsk, Bakhmut is a town getting slowly eaten by the war. This week it is about three miles from the Russians, well within range. Next week it might be much closer.
Civilians with somewhere to go have left. In the ruins in Donbas, the victory in Kyiv in March - the euphoria, glory and sacrifice - feel distant.
Bakhmut has been heavily shelled. Standing in front of his damaged house, a man in his 40s called Mitri showed defiance, apprehension and frustration. He had no idea what to expect in his town.
""I'm not Nostradamus. Why did Putin attack? It's all political games.""
Mitri said President Zelensky's predecessor Petro Poroshenko would have reached a ceasefire agreement by now.
""At least there was peace before, they were negotiating. It's a pity about the people who died, the soldiers. It is a real shame.""
It was, he said, President Zelensky's fault. He had missed an opportunity.
Mitri shrugged and sucked angrily on his cigarette when I asked him if he would accept a deal that allowed Russia to control all of Donbas, compared to roughly a third of the territory it controlled before the invasion.
""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive. This is just the beginning, everything is still to come. If we survive, we'll see how it goes.""
Thousands of civilians are still in Severodonetsk, as the Russians fight to encircle the last Ukrainian soldiers in the oblast of Luhansk, the northern side of Donbas.
At the railway station in Pokrovsk, a safe distance from the battle, I spoke to Lida, an elderly woman who uses a wheelchair. She had just been evacuated from Severodonetsk.
With other disabled and wounded civilians, she was being evacuated to the relative safety of western Ukraine on a special train, turned into an ambulance and intensive care unit by the medical organisation MSF, Doctors without Borders.
Lida, who radiated defiance and cigarette smoke, was rescued by soldiers who took her and other civilians through heavily shelled areas.
""They bombed everything, we barely escaped. Glass is smashed, everything is scattered around. And I am not able to walk at all. Disabled. That's how it is.
""Nine storey buildings, the upper floors are destroyed. All ruined.
""Putin's a scoundrel. We used to live peacefully. There was a Soviet Union and so be it. They divided Ukraine and Russia. So that's why the problems began.""
If President Putin's forces can encircle Severodonetsk, their next targets would most likely be the key cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk in the Donetsk Oblast, the other side of Donbas.
Then he might declare victory in the battle for Donbas.
I saw lines of freshly dug trenches near the two cities, as the Ukrainians prepared fall back positions. If they fell, and it is no certainty as they are both heavily defended, President Putin would be able to declare his first significant victory of the war.
Russia would control a belt of territory stretching along its border south from Donbas and along most of Ukraine's coastline.
President Zelensky says that only diplomacy can end the war, but he has said that Russia must return to the positions it held before the invasion.
His allies, led by the US and UK, want to weaken Putin's Russia permanently. They have said Russia must not win.
Their critics say they'll fight to the last Ukrainian.
The currency of war is blood. As families bury their dead, more Ukrainians, like Mitri in Bakhmut, will question the blood price they are paying, and ask whether it is better to pay for a ceasefire with land - or lives.The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion.

Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"".
In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.
Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring.
It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports.
Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"".
His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"".
""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said.
Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis.
On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister urged the international community to create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country.
Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed.
A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume.
However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added.
Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures.
Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria.
And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year.
Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term.
He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices.
""We have to explain to the public opinion what are the consequences of the war,"" he said. ""Putin's main tool is intimidation, fear, illusions and propaganda.""
On the possibility of a trade war between the UK and EU, Mr Morawiecki said it would be ""lose-lose"".
""Only Putin and our enemies will be happy with yet another disagreement between such close partner partners as the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said.
He said there was room for compromise between Brussels and London and he was trying ""to calm down the situation between France and the United Kingdom as much as possible"".
When pushed about what would happen if the UK unilaterally breaks the deal, as is currently being planned for, the Polish PM replied: ""In the current circumstances in particular, where we have such a brutal invasion, it should be a wake up call for those who want to disagree on anything.
""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak.""
But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues.
Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war.
""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything.""
Mr Morawiecki added that, as with other wars, including the Second World War, ""we have to be prepared for a long war, unfortunately, and we have to make public opinion knowledgeable about what is going on in Ukraine"".Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"".
In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.

The war has now become a ""global issue"" underscoring the importance of defending international order, he said.
Japanese PM Fumio Kishida echoed his comments, saying that a similar invasion should not happen in Asia.
Mr Biden was meeting the leaders of Japan, Australia and India in Tokyo in his first visit to Asia as president.
The four countries known collectively as the Quad discussed security and economic concerns including China's growing influence in the region - and differences over the Russian invasion.
Mr Biden's comments came a day after he warned China that it was ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan, and vowed to protect Taiwan militarily if China attacked, appearing to contradict a long-standing US policy on the issue.
It was later reported that Russian and Chinese warplanes had approached Japanese airspace as part of a joint military patrol, prompting Tokyo to announce it had scrambled jets in response.
Russian officials said the flight over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea was part of an annual military exercise.
Mr Kishida told a news conference that planning the exercise to coincide with today's summit was ""provocative"".
In his opening remarks at Tuesday's summit, Mr Biden said their meeting was about ""democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure that we deliver"".
The Ukraine war, he said, ""is going to affect all parts of the world"" as Russia's blockade of Ukraine grain exports aggravates a global food crisis.
Mr Biden promised the US would work with allies to lead the global response, reiterating their commitment to defend international order and sovereignty ""regardless of where they were violated in the world"" and remaining a ""strong and enduring partner"" in the Indo-Pacific region.
After their meeting, Mr Kishida told reporters that all four countries ""including India"" agreed on the importance of the rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity; and that ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force will never be tolerated"".
India is the only Quad member that has refused to directly criticise Russia for the invasion, and, in what appeared to be a concession to Delhi, there was no mention of Russia in the joint statement issued at the end of the talks.
There was also no direct reference to China or its activities, but the Quad nations announced a new maritime monitoring initiative that is expected to step up surveillance of Chinese activity in the region, along with a plan to spend at least $50bn (£40bn) on infrastructure projects and investment over the next five years.
Formally referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose grouping of countries following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that banded together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. The group fell dormant before it was resuscitated in 2017.
Since then however, the top leaders have gathered four times in less than two years, meeting once in Washington last September and twice virtually.
Analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given the grouping more impetus.
There has been mounting discomfort with China's growing assertiveness in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes between China and several countries, and a land boundary conflict with India.
Beijing's heavy investment in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia, while Japan has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy in its waters.
On Monday, Mr Biden unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led trade pact aiming to promote regional growth that includes 13 countries, mostly in Asia.
US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said it would provide countries ""an alternative to China's approach"". Officials said it would set standards in the areas of trade, supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and anti-corruption.
The IPEF has been widely seen as a way for the US to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific after former US President Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a regional trade pact - in 2017.The world is ""navigating a dark hour in our shared history"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden told key Asian allies.

A scheme for sponsoring Ukrainians who are seeking refuge in Guernsey has officially been launched.
The Guernsey Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme aims to ensure beneficiaries are ""provided with a sponsorship arrangement that is safe, suitable and dignified"".
About 300 islanders have expressed an interest in becoming sponsors.
Deputy Rob Prow, President of the Committee for Home Affairs, said it had taken a ""considerable amount of work"".
He added:  ""We absolutely needed to make sure that we could provide the necessary support to beneficiaries, some of whom may arrive with complex needs given the horrors they may have experienced.
""We needed to make sure an appropriate policy was in place to meet expectations as a responsible jurisdiction. And we had to carry out the necessary legal amendments to effect the changes to the Immigration Rules, to ensure visas can be granted to Ukrainian beneficiaries.""
People who put themselves forward as sponsors will be contacted, with a focus on those who can provide a self-contained unit of accommodation.
Ukrainian residents applying for the scheme will need to be matched to an approved sponsor prior to applying for a visa.
For the purposes of safeguarding, all individuals resident at a sponsors address may be subject to security checks as part of the visa application process, the States said.
The new policy covers eligibility for the scheme and the standards an individual will need to meet in order to become an approved sponsor.
It also details the visa application process and access to public services that Ukrainian beneficiaries can expect.
Deputy Prow said: ""It is paramount that any arrangements provided for beneficiaries under the scheme are safe, suitable and dignified.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61564440;2022-05-24;Ukraine war: Russia's jailed Navalny attacks invasion as judge rejects appeal;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Russia's prominent jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny has lost an appeal against a nine-year prison term, but not before launching a scathing attack on the war in Ukraine.
Condemning Vladimir Putin's war as stupid, he said it was ""like your courts, built entirely on lies"".
Navalny was already serving a jail term when he was convicted in a fraud case rejected by supporters as fabricated.
He addressed the court in Moscow via a video link at his penal colony.
Long seen as a President Putin's most vocal critic in Russia, Navalny was detained the moment he flew home from Germany after treatment for a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Siberia in August 2020.
He was initially jailed for two and a half years for breaking bail conditions while being treated in hospital, but in March he was given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court.
The prosecutor told the court the verdict in March had been fair and justified but Navalny's defence lawyer argued it had contradicted international law. In comments that were repeatedly interrupted, Navalny said he despised the court and said the rulings against him were no different from the lies used by ""madman"" President Putin and state TV to justify the war.
""You will suffer a historic defeat in this stupid war that you started. It has no purpose or meaning. Why are we fighting a war?"" he said.
Russia has silenced criticism of its three-month war in Ukraine, prosecuting dozens of people who have refused to use the term ""special military operation"" and blocking independent media outlets.
During Tuesday's appeal hearing, Navalny told the court that the judge who gave him his initial jail term in February 2021, Natalya Repnikova, had later told his lawyers she regretted her decision. Repnikova died months later of coronavirus ""according to the official version"", he reportedly told the court.
Since Navalny was jailed last year he has been held in a jail at Pokrov, east of Moscow, but he now faces being transferred to a penal colony with a far stricter regime and very limited rights to prison visits. His colleagues say he is due to be moved to a facility in Melekhovo, where one former prisoner has made allegations of systematic torture.Russia's prominent jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny has lost an appeal against a nine-year prison term, but not before launching a scathing attack on the war in Ukraine.

A woman who moved from the UK to Poland to help Ukrainian refugees says she has been both inspired and devastated by what she has witnessed.
Lucie Shanks, 43, left her home in Whitley Bay in March to go and help in the wake of the Russian invasion.
The former support worker has since got to know many refugees and has been struck by their strength and resilience in the face of suffering.
""Anyone of them could be you or me,"" she told BBC Radio Newcastle.
Ms Shanks, who runs a candle business, said she felt moved to do something after reports of people fleeing Ukraine.
""I actually saw a woman on the news and I just thought that could be my mum,"" she said.
""It was just devastating, I couldn't stand by and watch.""
She travelled to Poland independently but is now managing an eight-strong team of aid workers from across the world called The International Humanitarian Support Team.
As well as helping Ukrainians fleeing the invasion, Ms Shanks' group are making regular journeys into Ukraine to deliver supplies to those left behind.
She said she has seen the widespread destruction caused by missile strikes and came close to being hit while on a trip to the city of Lviv.
""Putin is just destroying everywhere and causing so much devastation,"" she said.
Ms Shanks is being cautious about who she speaks to amid fears Russian spies might be leaking information which could put aid workers in peril.
The BBC has decided not to reveal where in Poland her group is based.
""I don't think anybody feels safe but if we don't do it, that is what Putin is trying to achieve, to scare aid workers to not get aid to the front line,"" she said

She said the circumstances were heart-breaking: ""Mentally you've got to try and push things down because otherwise everything is going to go to pot.""
She said she felt ""quite emotional"" about the ""most lovely"" people of Ukraine, adding: ""These people are hard working, polite, very caring.

A Russian diplomat has quit his post in disgust over the invasion of Ukraine - saying he had never been as ashamed of his country as he was the day the war started.
It is the highest-profile resignation over the war yet from a Moscow official, and came on the same day a Kyiv court found a Russian tank commander guilty of war crimes.
Meanwhile in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region Russian forces have been intensifying their attacks on the city of Severodonetsk.
Boris Bondarev walked away from his 20-year career in the Russian foreign service on Monday, publishing a scathing statement which criticised both the war and his former employer.
In the letter, the 41-year-old said the ""bloody, witless"" war had been ""unleashed by Putin"" and was designed to keep those behind it ""in power forever"" - whatever the cost.
Mr Bondarev is one of few to speak out in such a public way, and has been cheered on by people like Kira Yarmysh, the spokesperson for the jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.
But he told the BBC he did not think many of his colleagues would follow his lead. Instead, he said, many of them had welcomed the war.

Tank commander Sgt Vadim Shishimarin became the first Russian soldier to be convicted in Ukraine for a war crime relating to the invasion.
Shishimarin was jailed for life by a court in Kyiv which found he had shot dead a civilian in the early days of the invasion back in February.
The captured soldier admitted killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka but said he had been following orders.
In a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become a recurring accusation, the verdict sets a significant legal precedent.
Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred.
Since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the United Nations.
As the court delivered its verdict in Ukraine's capital, the country's east was coming under intensifying attacks from Russian forces.
The city of Severodonetsk, the largest one under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk province, was targeted by Russian artillery and missile fire.
Moscow is trying to capture the city and yesterday officials claim they repelled Russian forces trying to enter it from four different directions.
UK defence officials say capturing the city of 100,000 is one of Moscow's ""immediate tactical priorities.""
Lilia Yapparova is an independent Russian journalist who could face years in prison for covering the invasion as she sees it.
Right now she is reporting from Kyiv, but a return to Russia could mean criminal prosecution for failing to toe the official Kremlin line on the war.
""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford.
She risks joining the dozens of Russians who have already been prosecuted under Moscow's draconian ""fake news"" law.
Thousands of kilometres away in Wales, some Ukrainian families have said that strict quarantine rules for pets are making it harder for them to settle into their new lives.
Under Welsh rules, many animals brought into the country have to stay in a quarantine centre for up to four months.

""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford.
She risks joining the dozens of Russians who have already been prosecuted under Moscow's draconian ""fake news"" law.
Thousands of kilometres away in Wales, some Ukrainian families have said that strict quarantine rules for pets are making it harder for them to settle into their new lives.
Under Welsh rules, many animals brought into the country have to stay in a quarantine centre for up to four months.
The government in Cardiff says it is trying to reduce the risk of rabies, but elsewhere in the UK animals can quarantine at home after health checks.
""We love Wales and our host family but half of our family isn't here,"" said Larysa Martseva - who's two Rhodesian Ridgebacks have been in kennels since their arrival from Ukraine on 26 April."

Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.
Russian troops are occupying the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant by the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine.
It is Europe's biggest nuclear plant. The Ukrainian staff are still operating it, but Russia has sent its own nuclear experts to monitor their work.
Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from it to Ukraine.
Marat Khusnullin said Russia would integrate the Zaporizhzhia plant with Russia's energy system if Kyiv refused to pay for the plant's electricity.
Visiting Russian-occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday he said ""if the Ukrainian energy system is ready to receive [electricity] and pay for it, then we'll work, but if not - then the plant will work for Russia"".
However a spokesman for Ukraine's state nuclear agency Energoatom said it would take years to link the plant to Russia.
""The plant only works in Ukraine's energy grid,"" Leonid Oliynyk told the BBC.
""The Russians can build a power line theoretically, but it will take a long time, like their Crimean bridge - several years,"" he said, referring to the bridge connecting Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to Russian territory.
""Now the power station is working at a minimum level, but Kyiv remains in charge, all the power lines are controlled by Ukraine. The Russian statement is wishful thinking,"" Mr Oliynyk added.
Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. But now just two of its six reactors are operating.
Ukrainian forces still control the city of Zaporizhzhia, on the opposite bank of the Dnieper. The nuclear power plant is in Enerhodar, a town of nearly 53,000 built in Soviet times to house the nuclear workers.
There have been several protest rallies in Enerhodar against the Russian occupation, violently broken up by Russian security forces with tear gas and stun grenades.
During his visit Mr Khusnullin said ""I think this region's future is to work in our friendly Russian family"".
On 3 March Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant, and later took control of it. Buildings around one of its reactors were damaged, according to Energoatom.
The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said radiation levels and reactor safety were not affected.
World leaders condemned Russia for the attack and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"".
The IAEA says the situation at the plant now remains ""fragile"" and ""unsustainable"", as Russian troops keep the staff under tight surveillance, along with a team of experts from Rosatom - Russia's state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it is trying to negotiate an inspection visit to the site.
Mr Oliynyk said ""the staff feel bad, because there's a lot of technical pressure on them, the Russians are behaving as occupiers"". He said Russia was keeping about 500 troops and 50 armoured vehicles at the site. ""They're checking documents, they don't let people speak freely and break up meetings in Enerhodar.""
He insisted that Ukraine ""will liberate the whole territory - no deals with the occupiers"".
Russia's temporary occupation of Chernobyl in northern Ukraine - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - also alarmed world leaders.
The radiation level at the decommissioned plant is reported to be stable and within safe limits, but there are hotspots in places nearby where Russian soldiers dug trenches.
There have been some forest fires in the exclusion zone around the plant - not directly threatening it, Mr Oliynyk said. But he added: ""Firefighters cannot go there as so many mines were laid, it's too dangerous.""
After Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region, he said, Ukraine stockpiled nuclear fuel, so now it has enough to last two years.
Ukraine now has a deal with US power company Westinghouse to provide nuclear fuel, with the goal of replacing the 40% of nuclear fuel that Kyiv still gets from Moscow.Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61525477;2022-05-24;Ukraine war: Melitopol residents resist Russian occupation;"Russian forces met fierce resistance from residents when they arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol in February.
Locals tried to block armoured vehicles as the convoy of soldiers rolled in to occupy the city, and people flooded the streets waving Ukrainian flags.
When the Russians started cracking down on the protesters, the resistance movement was forced to evolve and new groups emerged.
Melitopol, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, is an area where partisan warfare has been active since at least the middle of March.
Ukraine's Military Intelligence Directorate has reported that from 20 March to 12 April ""partisans eliminated 70 Russian soldiers during their night patrol"".
These groups are continuing to carry out attacks.
Last Wednesday a Russian armoured train was reportedly derailed. Days earlier, two Russian soldiers were found dead in the street. Last month a bridge near Melitopol - used to deliver supplies to the Russian army - was blown up.
Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, says these attacks were organised by partisan groups. ""It's the job of our partisans, our secret services and our soldiers. They do this job together,"" he tells the BBC.
Mr Fedorov himself was abducted by Russian forces and later released as part of a prisoner exchange.
The Russians are desperately trying to crush all resistance. They are searching houses and detaining people, residents say, often at random.
On 29 April, armed men in military uniform with white armbands - the marking used by Russian soldiers - abducted Boris Kleshev, the head of a local fire brigade in Melitopol.
For two weeks his relatives heard nothing about his whereabouts. A few days ago, a pro-Russian Telegram channel posted a video showing Mr Kleshev and other Ukrainian men admitting that they were sharing information on Russian movements with the Ukrainian military.
Mr Kleshev was speaking with a low voice, clearly under duress. But even if it looked like a forced confession, those who made the video were unlikely to have cared - their aim is to break the resistance spreading through Melitopol.
These resistance groups, however, are only a small part of the movement.
""Ninety per cent of Melitopol residents are now partisans and they resist in their own way,"" says Svitlana Zalizetska, a local journalist.
""Some people just stare at the Russian soldiers with hatred. Others sing patriotic songs at night. Some people hang posters in the street with Ukrainian flags,"" she says, adding that some also pass on information about Russian military movements.
At the start of the invasion in February, Melitopol residents organised mass protests against the Russian army's presence. People regularly took to the streets with Ukrainian flags, chanting: ""Melitopol is Ukraine.""
""Russian forces were truly shocked to see that the local population was not happy to see them. Those soldiers really believed that they were liberators,"" says Iryna (not her real name), who lives in Melitopol.
A few weeks after the invasion, police from Rosgvardia - Russia's national guard - arrived to crack down on the protests. They started dispersing crowds and detaining activists.
But Russian troops appear to understand that defeating the resistance here requires more than just stopping the rallies.
Unlike other regions occupied by Russian forces, the military in Melitopol have been trying to win people's hearts and minds. ""We have the brand of 'polite people'"", Iryna jokes, referring to the term used to describe Russian soldiers when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.
""These are ordinary guys who look like us and try to be nice,"" she explains. ""They help elderly women and show that they care about people. But they can't realise that it was them who created all these troubles and that our people didn't beg for help before.""
In order to create a perception of normality, the Russian forces try to silence anyone who openly opposes them.
Svitlana Zalizetska, who used to run a popular news website, was pressured to co-operate with the new authorities appointed by the Russian military. She refused. When the mayor, Mr Fedorov, was abducted, Svitlana realised she could be next. She later escaped into territory controlled by Ukrainian forces.
Then, Russian officers started threatening her family. ""First they wanted to destroy the website. They failed,"" she says. ""Then they tried to capture me. They failed again. Then they detained my father and took him hostage to make me come back, and gain control over the website.""
Only when she publicly acknowledged that she no longer owned the website and stopped writing for it, they released her father.
The Russian army is mobilising resources to change the pro-Ukrainian views of the population in Melitopol. They desperately want to get schools, shops and businesses to reopen with the aim of presenting Russian rule as a positive step.
And the longer the occupation lasts, the harder it is for people to resist. Some residents, with no funds left to feed their families, are returning to work - even if it implies supporting the new Russian regime.
""If they are physically killing Ukrainians in Mariupol, here they're trying to break our souls,"" says Iryna. ""But they will fail.""Russian forces met fierce resistance from residents when they arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol in February.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61548029;2022-05-23;Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports;"The international community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said.
Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed.
Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring.
It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports.
Ms Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's Minister of the Economy, urged the international community to help lift the blockade of the country's sea ports.
She said this could be a ""solution"" allowing Ukraine to export the grain currently stuck in its silos and unable to be shipped.
""We need the assistance of our international partners, to secure our exports through the sea ports... to find a way to build a corridor, or another solution, how to give an opportunity to Ukrainian vessels [to export via the Black Sea],"" she said. ""A safe passage.""
She hinted that military means might be necessary to achieve this.
""We need a guarantee from partners, of course it's a defence guarantee, a security guarantee, to be able to export [using] these vessels,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
""And to make it, not once but on a regular basis. That is most important.""
Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion.
As wheat prices soared on world commodity markets, the cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has gone up.
Ukraine is able to export small quantities of its commodities by river, rail and barges on the Danube river.
But Ms Svyrydenko warned those routes are insufficient.
""I think if you calculate it would take us five, six, seven years to export all these agricultural yields by these routes. So right now it's extremely important for us to unblock the seaports and we apply to our partners to do this,"" she said.
""The world needs it because Russia threatens the world with world hunger and the only way to solve this problem is to unblock the sea ports.
""If we don't give farmers the opportunity to export their goods, for them there won't be any sense in going to the next growing season,"" she continued.
Another item on the agenda, was how to make use of assets affected by international sanctions, Ms Svyrydenko said.
Ukraine made clear in March that it believed the assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and Russian central bank funds that have been frozen should be used to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine.
""We should take them and [use] them for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" she said. ""Otherwise what was the sense in freezing those assets, if no Ukrainian [would] receive them?""
""We just need to find a clear procedure for how to get these funds,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
Everything from railways stations to factories would need to be rebuilt, she said. Ukraine has estimated the amount of money needed to rebuild the country at around $600bn.
Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was examining how the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs could be used to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.The international community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said.

A same-sex couple who fled Ukraine have been welcomed into a home in Derbyshire after a woman and her wife offered to host LGBT refugees.
They were put in contact after a friend of the refugee couple read a BBC article.
One of the refugees, Tetiana, said living in the town of Belper was like being ""inside some English TV show"".
The BBC is not using photos of the couple as they were not openly in a relationship in Ukraine.
Sarah Barley-McMullen, who is hosting them with her wife Helen, said LGBT couples face more discrimination in Ukraine than they do in the UK.
""You are going against the family tradition and the Russian Orthodox Church,"" said Mrs Barley-McMullen, who is chair of Pride in Belper.
""You will then be accused of trying to destroy the culture and the identity of the country.
""It's so important that LGBT people from Ukraine are able to come to the UK and feel safe, often for the first time in their lives.""
Tetiana said she and her partner Yulia were struck by how beautiful their new home is.
""It's a very funny thing because our first and second and even third impression is we are in some movie, we are inside some English TV show, maybe Murder She Wrote, maybe Agatha Christie,"" she said.
""It's the setting for movies, for shows, because people cannot live in such a beautiful place. And very English, you know.""
But they still miss their own apartment, where they had lived for 10 years.
""Now I'm safe, I'm in a very wonderful place, I'm surrounded by wonderful people, but still, where is my home? Where is my former life? It's not here no more,"" said Tetiana.
Tetiana and Yulia had been temporarily living in Hungary and then Germany after fleeing their apartment in Ukraine.
Mrs Barley-McMullen said the visa process was more complicated because Yulia is Russian and the couple could not get married in Ukraine.
Same-sex marriage has been legal in the UK since 2014, but is not legal in Ukraine.
""There was a fear one of them couldn't get a visa, because they have no legal rights together as a couple,"" said Mrs Barley-McMullen.
""My wife and I had to write a letter to the visa office saying we would only accept them as an unmarried couple.""
They have now set up a group called OUT!Standing for Ukraine, for people in Derbyshire who want to support LGBT refugees.
One problem, Mrs Barley-McMullen said, is that the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme does not allow people to specify they would welcome LGBT refugees.
""You can specify whether you are happy to house some refugees with a pet but there isn't anything around sexuality or gender identity,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61555390;2022-05-23;Russian diplomat quits over war in Ukraine;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
A Russian diplomat has quit his job in protest at the ""bloody, witless"" war ""unleashed by Putin against Ukraine"".
Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor.
But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"".
Moscow has not yet commented.
Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"".
In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"".
""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote.
""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.""
The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy.
As resignation letters go, this one was scathing.
Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine.
""The aggressive war… the most serious crime… warmongering, lies and hatred…""
It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions.
Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.'
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so.""
Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"".
""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views.
""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said.
In contrast, Mr Bondarev said in his open letter he had ""never been so ashamed of my country"" as he was on 24 February, the day the invasion began.
It is unclear if he is the first diplomat to resign from the mission, although no one else has spoken out publicly.
Mr Bondarev is under no illusions that Moscow will now see him as a traitor, but notes he hasn't ""done anything illegal"".
""I just resigned and spoke my mind,"" he said. ""But I think I have to be concerned about my safety of course.""A Russian diplomat has quit his job in protest at the ""bloody, witless"" war ""unleashed by Putin against Ukraine"".
Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor.
But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"".
Moscow has not yet commented.
Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"".
In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"".
""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote.
""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.""
The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy.
As resignation letters go, this one was scathing.
Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine.
""The aggressive war… the most serious crime… warmongering, lies and hatred…""
It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions.
Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.'
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so.""
Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"".
""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views.
""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61549569;2022-05-23;Ukraine war: Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin jailed for life over war crime;"A court in Ukraine has jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the invasion.
Captured soldier Sgt Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka on 28 February.
He admitted shooting Mr Shelipov but said he had been acting on orders and asked forgiveness of the man's widow.
Many other alleged war crimes are being investigated by Ukraine.
And in a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become one of the defining features, Monday's outcome sets a significant legal precedent.
Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred.
Ukraine, however, is likely to bring more cases like this to unpick Moscow's blanket denials.
This sentencing is unlikely to lead to an immediate change in tactics from the invading forces, but it does bring Oleksandr Shelipov's widow Kateryna Shelipova justice.
Imposing the life sentence, Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, 21, had carried out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank.
""Given that the crime committed is a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order... the court does not see the possibility of imposing a [shorter] sentence of imprisonment,"" he said.
Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out.
His lawyer said an appeal would be lodged against the verdict.
The Kremlin's response is already in motion, with laws being drafted and courts being set up in Russia to try some Ukrainian prisoners as war criminals.
This suggests both countries could soon find themselves in a legal tit-for-tat while the conflict rages on.
Shishimarin served in Russia's Kantemirovskaya tank division. At the time of the killing, he and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit.
When they spotted Mr Shelipov he was speaking on his phone, Shishimarin told the court. He said he was told to shoot him with an assault rifle.
His defence lawyer told the court on Friday that Shishimarin had only fired after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three to four rounds had hit the man.
He said Shishimarin fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and he questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill.
In one dramatic moment, the victim's widow Kateryna Shelipova confronted Shishimarin. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?"" she asked, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine.
""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?""
The soldier had no answer to that. Asking forgiveness of the widow earlier, he said: ""But I understand you won't be able to forgive me.""
Ms Shelipova told the BBC: ""I feel very sorry for him but for a crime like that - I can't forgive him.""
Since President Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the UN.
Among the dead are numerous suspected victims of war crimes in occupied towns such as Bucha.
Earlier this month, the BBC obtained CCTV footage of the killing of two civilians in cold blood allegedly by Russian soldiers, a case now being investigated by prosecutors as a suspected war crime.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61547756;2022-05-23;Ukraine war: Russian assault on key Donbas city intensifies;"Russian forces in eastern Ukraine are intensifying attacks on a key city as they seek to seize the Donbas region.
Severodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from Moscow's forces.
On Sunday, local officials said Russian troops were repelled after trying to enter the city from four directions.
It comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky urged world leaders to end all trade with Russia.
Speaking via video link at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Zelensky called for ""maximum sanctions"" to be imposed on Moscow, saying frozen Russian funds should be used to rebuild Ukrainian cities destroyed by the war.
""There has to be a precedent for punishing the aggressor,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""If the aggressor loses everything then it definitely deprives him of any motivation to start a war.""
Meanwhile, Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai accused Moscow of adopting a ""scorched-earth approach"" in its efforts to capture the city of Severodonetsk.
""Every day they are trying to break the line of defence,"" Mr Gaidai said. ""They are simply systematically destroying the city. Everywhere is being shelled constantly.""
The city of 100,000 people sits on a strategic position on the Donets River, with UK defence officials saying it has likely become one of Russia's ""immediate tactical priorities"".
Mr Gaidai warned that Russian forces have destroyed all but one bridge across the Donets river and said that the city is at risk of being cut off.
He also accused Russian tanks of firing on residential buildings during fighting in the city and of seeking to erase Severodonetsk ""from the face of the earth"".
Ukraine's human right's ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said the city risks suffering the same fate as Mariupol - being surrounded and pounded into submission.
""The enemy threw all his forces to storm Severodonetsk, on the outskirts of which there are constant battles,"" Ms Denisova wrote on Telegram.
by Jeremy Bowen in Donbas
We visited the Ukrainian front line yesterday and the main thrust of the Russian activities at the moment is at Severodonetsk. Kyiv's soldiers have told us it is largely surrounded and they are undoubtedly under pressure.
They've taken serious casualties and a Ukrainian military source said one unit that went into combat with 240 men returned with just 135 - the others killed, wounded or taken prisoner.
The Russians have taken some territory - villages and little towns - but it's a very heavily defended area. They've been fighting around there since 2014 and there are concrete Ukrainian positions that are hard to overcome.
A couple of days ago in Moscow, the ministry of defence said they would take the whole of the Luhansk region.
If Vladimir Putin can seize the whole of Luhansk and then do something similar in Donetsk, he could then say to Russians: ""This is a victory guys.""
It would be nothing like the victory he sought when all this started in February, but one he could declare anyway. The Ukrainian authorities are very anxious that doesn't happen.
Elsewhere, at least seven civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in Sunday's bombardment of the Donetsk region, according to the Ukrainian army's Facebook page.
Shelling and missile strikes have targeted Kharkiv in the north, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, officials said.
The UK's Ministry of Defence has said that Russia has likely suffered a similar number of casualties in Ukraine as it did during the entirety of the Soviet war in Afghanistan.
It said ""a combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes officials"" had contributed to the high figures.
It is unclear exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in its invasion.
Moscow, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official figures since March, when defence officials said some 1,351 troops had been killed.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has said the global number of forcibly displaced people has risen above 100 million for the first time.
Officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to the grim milestone. More than 14 million people are thought to have fled their homes since the war began on 24 February.
The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the announcement should serve as a wake up call for world leaders.
""The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,"" Mr Grandi said. ""But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure.
""To reverse this trend the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight or exile.""Russian forces in eastern Ukraine are intensifying attacks on a key city as they seek to seize the Donbas region.

To Ukrainians it was clear from the very start of Russia's invasion that this was no ""special operation"" to liberate the Donbas region, as Vladimir Putin had declared. It was all-out war.
But in Russia it's a crime to call it that.
Dozens of people have already been prosecuted under the ""fake news"" law, as it's known. They face up to 15 years behind bars for challenging the official line on Russia's invasion or criticising the military.
It's a dramatic increase in censorship in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has spent his two decades in power removing opponents, stifling free speech and silencing the independent media: a dismantling of democracy that is having devastating consequences here in Ukraine.
Vladimir Kara-Murza tried to warn of the danger.
In a speech in the US in March, the Russian opposition activist lambasted Western leaders for seeking constant ""resets"" in relations with Mr Putin, allowing their countries to act as havens for tainted money and looking the other way even as Russia became ever less free.
""The whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine,"" Mr Kara-Murza told the Arizona House of Representatives, a fortnight into the war. ""The bombing of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. The war crimes. These are war crimes.""
But in Russia uttering such words is also a crime now.
A month after his speech, Mr Kara-Murza was picked up by police in Moscow and later charged with ""spreading false information"" about Russia's military. He's still in custody. The law he is accused of breaking was passed in March, soon after the invasion.
And yet Ukrainian prosecutors have already registered more than 11,000 alleged war crimes. A Russian soldier has admitted in court to shooting a civilian. And the BBC has gathered its own evidence, including CCTV footage of the shooting of two civilians by Russian forces.
Those returning to salvage what they can from the wreckage of Andriivka have more, powerful testimony.
When Russia invaded Ukraine, many families fled Kyiv for nearby villages like this, thinking they would be safer away from the capital. Instead they spent weeks cowering in cold cellars as occupying soldiers drove tanks into their yards and dug trenches in their vegetable plots.
After the Russians withdrew, in April, the village elder says the bodies of 13 residents were found here.
""They had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head,"" says Anatoliy Kibukevych. He then names every one of the victims.
The main road - the route taken by Russian tanks ordered to seize Kyiv - is lined with the rubble of homes: heaps of singed bricks with metal bedframes or pots and pans oddly marooned in the middle of them. Painted pleas that read ""Children!"" or ""People!"" on garden gates have been pierced by shrapnel.
""Truth is the regime's main enemy,"" says Evgenia Kara-Murza, Vladimir's wife, from Washington DC, where she lives for safety reasons. ""That's why I believe this regime is using this law to crush all dissent in Russia and to scare people into silence,""
""I'm sure Vladimir realised the risks were high. They have never been low for him,"" she says, with a reminder that her activist husband was poisoned twice in the past and nearly died.
But he kept returning to Russia and speaking out.
""He believes there comes a moment where you can't be afraid anymore and need to show to other people that they shouldn't be either.""
When the war in Ukraine started, Lilia Yapparova felt compelled to cover it.
""I couldn't sleep, because people started to die… and I needed to be there,"" she told me in Kyiv, where for a while she was the only Russian reporter on the ground in Ukrainian-controlled areas.
There are only three even now - all women from independent media outlets. It's a tiny contingent compared with the Russian state TV correspondents who stride through eastern Ukraine in military clothing, ""Z"" patches on their arms in support of Russian soldiers, talking about ""denazification"" and the ""liberation"" of cities like Mariupol.
Ms Yapparova wanted to at least dent that solid wall of propaganda.
""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she says.
But that's a battle of its own, on top of the danger of working on Ukraine's frontlines.
Meduza, the news site Ms Yapparova writes for, has been banned in Russia, like almost all independent outlets. Journalists and media have been labelled as ""foreign agents"" while Facebook and other social media are blocked.
Meanwhile, state TV channels have all switched to wall-to-wall coverage of Russia's ""special operation"".
""For now we lost the war with propaganda,"" Ms Yapparova concedes, describing how even people she knows personally are absorbing the official line. She feels a sense of responsibility for that, although the odds were stacked impossibly against her.
And now she knows that every word she writes from Ukraine - true stories about the shooting of civilians, mass graves, terrible destruction - is putting her at risk of prosecution for ""fake news"".
""I am ready for that. I am not covering my eyes. I see the law for what it is,"" the journalist says. ""But I couldn't allow myself not to be here.""
It doesn't stop her worrying, though.
""Constantly. It hurts sometimes to write because I can't hide facts, but am I going to jail for that? Anything can happen.""
For Michael Nacke the danger is already real.
The young journalist left Russia before the war, escaping an environment that became increasingly repressive.
He is now a wanted man for telling the truth.
""I used the word 'war' instead of 'special operation',"" he says of his ""crime"" as set-out by Russian investigators in a 91-page statement. ""It doesn't matter which law they use against you, it's just to make you shut up.""
The prosecution is based on an episode on his YouTube channel in which he discusses how Russian tanks fired on a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. The incident was widely condemned, including at an emergency session of the UN Security Council. But Moscow claims Ukrainian forces set the fire themselves so in Russia that makes reporting anything else illegal.
""The one thing that I understand after this is that the work I do really matters,"" Mr Nacke says of the criminal case against him. ""I used to ask myself: 'Is my work effective to stop the war?' Now I see that it makes sense.""
The risks and consequences of this war are far more severe for Ukrainians, as every shattered inch of Andriivka shows.
""We've been through so much. Fear and horror,"" Alina Petrovna tells me, as her son nails tarpaulin over the holes left in their roof by the shockwaves of heavy shelling. The elderly lady lived in the family vegetable cellar for 29 days after Russian troops took over her village. She was terrified.
There are bullet holes in the front door where soldiers shot their way through to loot from them. The only thing they left untouched were her icons.
""Let the Russian people come and see what they did to us!"" Her eyes fill with angry tears. ""Fear and horror,"" she repeats.
But most in Russia will never even hear about such suffering. Because Vladimir Putin has not only launched a war on Russia's neighbour, he has declared a war on truth.

But Moscow claims Ukrainian forces set the fire themselves so in Russia that makes reporting anything else illegal.
""The one thing that I understand after this is that the work I do really matters,"" Mr Nacke says of the criminal case against him. ""I used to ask myself: 'Is my work effective to stop the war?' Now I see that it makes sense.""
The risks and consequences of this war are far more severe for Ukrainians, as every shattered inch of Andriivka shows.
""We've been through so much. Fear and horror,"" Alina Petrovna tells me, as her son nails tarpaulin over the holes left in their roof by the shockwaves of heavy shelling. The elderly lady lived in the family vegetable cellar for 29 days after Russian troops took over her village. She was terrified.
There are bullet holes in the front door where soldiers shot their way through to loot from them. The only thing they left untouched were her icons.
""Let the Russian people come and see what they did to us!"" Her eyes fill with angry tears. ""Fear and horror,"" she repeats.
But most in Russia will never even hear about such suffering. Because Vladimir Putin has not only launched a war on Russia's neighbour, he has declared a war on truth.

Under Welsh rules, many animals brought over have to be in quarantine centres for up to four months.
Elsewhere in the UK they can quarantine in homes after health checks.
The Welsh government said it wants to reduce the risk of rabies and has ""concerns about how the current home isolation process can be monitored and enforced effectively"".
Marianna Koniushenko, 18, who fled to Cardiff with her family, said her two dogs would help the trauma and anxiety she suffers after escaping Bucha in Ukraine.
Along with brother Roman, 14, and mother Larysa Martseva, she managed to escape, despite people in cars in front and behind them being killed by Russian troops.
But they had to leave their Rhodesian Ridgebacks Trisha and Vinchi in Dover when they arrived the UK on 26 April.
They are now in kennels in Poulton-le-Fylde, south of Blackpool and they do not know when they will be reunited.
Ms Koniushenko said she is suffering from trauma following their experiences, adding: ""I think the dogs could help me. I can hug them and tell them all about my problems.
""I feel really upset. It's like a part of me. The dogs are a part of our family.""
Her mum said: ""My children have lost a huge part of their emotional support. Their lives - their happy lives in their country - changed just like that.
""They had a nice life and it's very important for all of us to be all together.""
The family has been sent photos of the dogs by staff at the kennels, but Ms Martseva added: ""I was crying when I saw the photos because it's like giving children to an orphanage.
""We love Wales and our host family but half of our family isn't here.""
The family pleaded ""please let the dogs be with us"", with Ms Martseva saying: ""They are a five hour drive away. At least it would be great if the kennels were in Wales we're ready to drive to see them every day but we can't.""
In Montgomery, Powys, on the border with England, three generations of the Komrokova family now live with a host family.
Their three cats Senia, Charly and Flora are in a cattery, and they are trying to secure a temporary home for them nearby, in England, so they can visit them.
Rita, eight, who has additional learning needs, finds comfort from spending time with the cats.
Mark Michaels, who is hosting the family, said: ""We're a stone's throw from England here. You look out of the window and England is there it just seems desperately unfair. They would have chosen to be in England if they'd known they couldn't be with their animals.""
Vladyslav Sdarikov, 24, who lives in Conwy, said he and his girlfriend, Darya Holodiak would have thought of different options if they had known their one-year-old pug Taylor had to quarantine in a kennel.
Mr Sdarikov said: ""We cannot have him because of this invisible border for animals.""
Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said she worked closely with the chief veterinary officer when considering the rules.
""We haven't had rabies in this country for 100 years,"" she said.
""This is about protecting the animal that arrives from Ukraine. It's about protecting animals here in Wales and of course it's about public health as well.
""England and Scotland have chosen home confinement as a form of quarantine - how do you enforce that? How do you ensure that it absolutely takes place? It's impossible in my view.""
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We understand how important people's pets are to them and we want to do everything we can to ensure people seeking refuge in Wales are reunited with their pets safely and as quickly as possible.
""We also need to take steps to protect the health and welfare of all animals in Wales by reducing the risk of exposing them to diseases such as rabies.

The Ukrainian government says it will not agree a ceasefire deal with Russia that involves giving up territory.
The apparent hardening of Ukraine's position comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war could be resolved only through diplomacy.
Presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said concessions would lead to an even larger and bloodier Russian offensive.
His comments come as Russia continues attempts to encircle Ukrainian forces defending Severodonetsk in the east.
In another development, Polish President Andrzej Duda has become the first foreign leader to address the parliament in Kyiv in person.
He received a standing ovation as he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future.
He added that Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the EU.
However, France's Europe Minister, Clément Beaune, said in a radio interview on Sunday that it would probably take ""15 or 20 years"" for Ukraine to be accepted as an EU member.
As fighting continued, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in its daily update that Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defences to reach the administrative borders of the country's easternmost Luhansk region.
Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had attempted to break into Severodonetsk from four separate directions.
Writing on the Telegram messaging app, he said the attempts had been unsuccessful, but shelling of residential areas was continuing.
He added that a bridge connecting the city to nearby Lysychansk had been destroyed.
It was not possible for the BBC to verify the claims independently.
There have been calls in some Western nations for a ceasefire that could involve Russian forces remaining in some of the territory they have occupied in the south and east of Ukraine since Moscow invaded the country on 24 February.
Most recently, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told his country's Senate on Thursday that a ceasefire ""must be achieved as soon as possible"".
But Mr Podolyak said that any such moves would backfire.
""The war will not stop. It will just be put on pause for some time,"" he said. ""They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.""

Sweden and Finland have formally applied to join the Western security alliance Nato.
Their decision was prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is being welcomed by most of the 30 existing countries in Nato.
However, Turkey is opposing either country joining the pact, saying the two countries support anti-Turkish terrorists.
Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a defensive military alliance. It was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France.
Members agree to come to one another's aid if they come under armed attack. Finland will take it to 31 members.
Nato's original aim was to counter Russian expansion in Europe after World War Two.
Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many of its former Eastern European allies joined Nato.
Both countries have been neutral for many years, but public support for joining Nato has grown since Russia invaded Ukraine.
It can take a year to apply and become a Nato member, and all member states must agree that a new country can join.
In order to join Nato, countries must be democracies, treat minorities fairly and commit to resolving conflicts peacefully.
They must also provide military support to the alliance.
Both Finland - which has a 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia - and Sweden have highly capable militaries.
Nato members agree to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. Finland already meets this target and Sweden says it will do so ""as soon as possible"".
However, one Nato member, Turkey, says it will refuse to let in either Sweden or Finland.
Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says the two countries have been harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation.
However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he is confident that Finland and Sweden will both join, despite Turkish objections.
As Ukraine isn't a member, Nato isn't obliged to come to its defence.
Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West.
This is also why Nato rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining a priority.
But this has not happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition.
Russia believes Nato has been encroaching on its area of political influence by accepting new members from eastern Europe - and admitting Ukraine would bring Nato into its backyard.
Ukraine's President Zelensky has accepted his country can't join Nato at present, saying: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this.""
Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining.
Initially, Nato countries limited their supplies to defensive weapons.
The UK and US sent thousands of anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles.
Slovakia sent its S-300 anti-aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles.
Several Nato countries are now sending heavier weapons, to enable Ukraine to counter-attack Russia's army.
The US is sending helicopters, artillery and armoured personnel carriers. It plans to offer a $33bn (£26bn) grant for security and economic assistance to Ukraine on top of the $3.7bn (£3bn) it has already spent.
The UK is offering an extra £300m in military support to Ukraine and plans to send armoured vehicles, electronic warfare equipment and anti-artillery radar systems.
The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine - the first time the EU has helped provide arms to a warzone.
Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic in the north to Romania in the south.
They had been stationed there in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Nato has now sent elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to countries bordering Russia and Ukraine.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61493182;2022-05-18;Mariupol's Azovstal fighters: What next for Ukraine's captured soldiers;"Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, who have been holed up in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol for weeks, have left their positions and handed themselves over to Russian forces and pro-Russian separatists, according to Russia's defence ministry.
The evacuation marks the likely end of the battle for the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which lies in ruins after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment.
What happens next to the evacuated Azovstal fighters is unclear, with Ukraine calling for a prisoner swap but some in Russia suggesting they should be put on trial.
""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address after the evacuation of the steelworks began, adding that ""work continues to bring our lads home"".
But when and if that will happen is uncertain and details of the agreement brokered between the two sides, as well as the UN and the Red Cross, are unknown.
Ukraine says negotiations are ongoing to exchange the fighters for Russian prisoners of war, but Russia has not confirmed that a swap will take place.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the soldiers would be treated ""in line with the relevant international laws"", but there is concern over what will happen to them if they remain in Russian custody.
Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko told the BBC that if they are not returned to Ukraine, ""the fate of these very brave men will be absolutely unknown and will be in Russian hands, which is far from an ideal situation"".
The signals coming from Russia are concerning for Ukraine.
""Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,"" the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Tuesday. ""We should do everything to ensure they are put on trial.""
Another senior politician, Leonid Slutsky, went further, calling the evacuated combatants ""animals in human form"" and saying they should be executed.
And the Donetsk separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, suggested that Ukrainians who are found to be ""neo-Nazi war criminals"" should face an international tribunal.
But Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar told the BBC that such statements ""were most likely made for domestic propaganda in Russia"".
Russia claims, without any evidence, that Ukraine is a Nazi hotbed, and one of the key aims of Russia's military operation in Ukraine is to ""denazify"" the country.
The Azov regiment, whose members are amongst those evacuated from Azovstal, is the most frequent target for Russia's claim that it is fighting against Nazis in Ukraine.
The regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia in 2014 but is now a National Guard unit, once had links to the far right.
Ultimately, it is likely to be Vladimir Putin who makes the final decision over what happens to the Azovstal fighters.
I think there was a sharp intake of breath right across this country when the news was announced that some of the last soldiers bunkered in the Azovstal steelworks were not just leaving, but leaving to territory occupied by Russia.
It was an impossible choice - if they stayed in the steelworks they would face certain death, but what they face now is, at best, a very, very uncertain fate.
President Zelensky for weeks and weeks had been telling the fighters ""please give up if you feel you must, please don't feel you must give your lives in this fight"".
Again and again the fighters of the Azov battalion said ""no, we must continue to fight"".
Last night President Zelensky said this mission to evacuate the remaining soldiers - and to take care of the ones who have already left - involved, in his words, the most influential international mediators.
Because the only thing which has reassured many here, and most of all the families of the fighters, is that there is international involvement, that behind the scenes there is the Red Cross and the United Nations, and they are hoping against hope this can help to persuade Russia.
Mariupol is a strategic prize for the Russians but members of the Azov battalion, a group which has origins in the far right, are a prize for President Putin, who it is feared may parade them to say ""see, I told you there were Nazis in Ukraine"".Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, who have been holed up in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol for weeks, have left their positions and handed themselves over to Russian forces and pro-Russian separatists, according to Russia's defence ministry.

President Zelensky for weeks and weeks had been telling the fighters ""please give up if you feel you must, please don't feel you must give your lives in this fight"".
Again and again the fighters of the Azov battalion said ""no, we must continue to fight"".
Last night President Zelensky said this mission to evacuate the remaining soldiers - and to take care of the ones who have already left - involved, in his words, the most influential international mediators.
Because the only thing which has reassured many here, and most of all the families of the fighters, is that there is international involvement, that behind the scenes there is the Red Cross and the United Nations, and they are hoping against hope this can help to persuade Russia.
Mariupol is a strategic prize for the Russians but members of the Azov battalion, a group which has origins in the far right, are a prize for President Putin, who it is feared may parade them to say ""see, I told you there were Nazis in Ukraine""."

There is still no end in sight to the fighting in Ukraine - but according to the country's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, the conflict can only be resolved through diplomacy.
Speaking on Ukrainian television, he suggested his country could be victorious on the battlefield - but that the war could only come to a conclusive halt ""at the negotiating table"".
But he indicated this would not be easy, as neither side wanted to give anything up - and negotiations between the two sides have stalled.
Meanwhile, on the ground, Russia's military said Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks had been ""completely liberated"", with the last Ukrainian defenders surrendering.
However, the exact number of fighters who are now in Russian hands is still not clear.
Russia claims more than 2,000 have surrendered, a number that hasn't been confirmed by Ukraine.
But the end of fighting in Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere - with fierce fighting reported around the city of Severodonetsk as Russia steps up its attempt to capture the whole eastern region of Luhansk.
Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with her husband.
This is only the second time the couple have been seen together since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
She said that even though she hadn't seen her husband for two and a half months, not even the war could take him away from her.
Kherson was the first city in Ukraine to be occupied by Russia. But in the past few weeks, more people have been seeking to leave the city as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory.
Escapees tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out.
The BBC spoke to Alexander, one of a number of volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war.
""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he says.
""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""

Speaking on national TV, he suggested his country could be victorious against Russia on the battlefield.
However, he added that the war could only come to a conclusive halt ""at the negotiating table"".
Meanwhile, heavy fighting is taking place in and around Severodonetsk, as Russian forces step up efforts to seize the whole of the Luhansk region.
The end of fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere and allowed them to intensify their onslaught in the east.
Local governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians were ""destroying"" Severodonetsk as they gradually surrounded it.
Writing on the messaging app Telegram, he said Ukrainian troops had repelled 11 attacks on the frontline - with eight tanks among the Russian vehicles destroyed. There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
BBC correspondent James Waterhouse said Russia had increased its artillery and air strikes as well as missile attacks - gaining ground mile by mile in Luhansk while the Ukrainians are forced to retreat.
In his TV address, Mr Zelensky said the conflict ""will be bloody, there will be fighting, but it will only definitively end through diplomacy"".
But he indicated this would not be easy, as neither side wanted to give anything up.
On Tuesday, Kyiv's lead negotiator, Mykhaylo Podolyak, said talks were on hold.
The following day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Kyiv authorities of not wanting to continue talks to end hostilities.
Russian news agencies say the last meeting happened nearly a month ago, on 22 April.
With no end in sight to the fighting, the US is sending more military, economic and humanitarian aid.
On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide a package for Ukraine worth nearly $40bn (£32bn), the White House said.
The money represents the largest programme of American assistance since Russia launched its invasion in February.
The bill, which will funnel support to Ukraine for about the next five months, includes some $6bn budgeted for armoured vehicles and air defences.
President Zelensky tweeted his gratitude, saying military aid was ""needed more than ever"".
It also emerged on Saturday that President Biden is one of over 900 US citizens who have been indefinitely banned from entering Russia.
The list also includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA chief William Burns and hundreds of members of Congress.

Katerina closed her eyes and took a breath when I asked about her husband, a fighter, who is still thought to be in the maze of tunnels beneath the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.
She'd been calm and composed until now. She too spent more than two months in one of the bunkers under the vast industrial facility with her two sons where the bombardment felt like it would never end.
""The missiles were so heavy it felt like the bunker walls were moving and the rooms themselves became smaller,"" she told me.
""Sometimes there was a one-hour break and we hoped maybe that's it. Maybe that's the end of it. But no. They carried on.""
Behind us, her two boys, aged 6 and 11, were playing with guns made from paper and duct tape.
""They are adapting to being outside again,"" said Katerina.
""Seeing them running around in the sun again is the best feeling in the world.""
She remembers all three of them being ""blinded by light"" as they finally emerged after two months in their dark refuge under the steel plant.
As the two boys duck and dive behind the trees in the park, they pretend they're fighting Russians.  At one point they drop to the ground and shout 'cover your ears'. One gives the shout of 'all clear' and they stand up and get going again.
It's haunting to watch.
Even the games with the guns feel realistic as they practice putting in a fresh magazine of bullets. They have obviously seen this up close.
Katerina believes their father is still at the plant.  She heard from him earlier this week and he was his usual upbeat self.
""He is a very strong man, strong in spirit. He has been supporting me all my life.""
It was love at first sight, she told me with a smile. Their hometown of Mariupol has now been hollowed out by Russian bombs.
Katerina first took her two boys to the Azovstal steel plant in early March, just after the first strikes on the port city. She thought they would use it as a shelter for maybe one or two days - a week at most. But as the bombing intensified, they had to stay below ground for more than 60 days.
Supplies dwindled. Food and water became scarce - along with information. As Russian forces encircled the city, she and around 30 others in their bunker were cut off.
Occasionally she would get a visit from her husband as he and around 1,000 other Ukrainian fighters continued to defend the steel plant - their last holdout.
""Whenever he visited us there, he would always tell us to hang in there, boosting everyone's morale, joking, laughing, cheering, telling us that we should not worry and that everything is fine.
""It was frightening because they were coming and leaving under shelling. It was weird to see them that cheerful, but I don't think there was any other way. In terms of morale and spirit, I think he is one of the strongest there.""
Katerina was finally brought above ground during an operation to free civilians organised by the Red Cross and the United Nations.
I first met her at the evacuation centre in Zaporizhzhia. When she stepped off the bus she had everything she owned stuffed in a rucksack on her back.
""There were several times when we were losing hope that we would ever get out,"" she told me back then.
Now, two weeks on, she is trying to plan a future for her family.
Her home has been destroyed, she has spent two months in a cold and fetid bunker beneath a steel plant and now she is watching and waiting for news for her husband.
And yet she remains upbeat - resilient.

The Kremlin still maintains that the Russian offensive is going according to plan. But studio guest Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, painted a very different picture.
He warned that ""the situation [for Russia] will clearly get worse"" as Ukraine receives additional military assistance from the West and that ""the Ukrainian army can arm a million people"".

She tearfully described seeing her hometown destroyed, people killed, and wanting to save her sons.
Having fled their home north of Dnipro, where military strikes began in early March, Ms Onopa and her boys travelled to Bucharest, Romania.
This was after attacks on the port city of Odesa made other methods of travel impossible.
They arrived in the Monmouthshire town last week after waiting five weeks for the British Embassy to approve their online application.
At the gathering, they were given the keys to a bungalow, a former caretaker's property which has been refurbished by volunteers from St Mary's RC Primary School and church with donations from across the area.
Speaking of the horrors she and her children had encountered after the war began, Ms Onopa thanked everyone who had helped them get to a place of safety, including the UK government who she said came to her aid when there were issues with their applications.
Ms Onopa said: ""The horrible situation happening to our country is because one person, one regime decided my country should not exist, that my nation should not exist.
""Imagine living next to a neighbour, he might have completely different opinions but you do live together.
""And one day your neighbour decides to invade your house, destroy your house, kill your kids, just because they think you're going to invade them.""
She said every mother would probably be able to understand how she was not scared for her own life, but those of her children.
""We saw our cities being destroyed, rockets falling on our houses and people dying, and the worst thing was we could do nothing to stop it,"" she added.
""All we could think about is what are we going to do next.""
Ms Onopa said she posted an appeal for help on social media and a group in the UK said they would help her.
She said travelling to the border she had seen thousands of displaced families, desperate for a route out of the war-torn areas.
""I was terrified I would lose my children so I wrote the addresses and contact details of my family in their rucksacks and clothes in the hope that should I die someone would  know where to take them to safety,"" she said.
Since arriving in the UK, Ms Onopa said she has felt ""overwhelmed"" with support.
""I don't have enough words to describe how grateful I am to everyone who helped,"" she said.
""I'm overwhelmed with the feeling that my kids can finally feel safe.""
Ms Onopa said she was keen to learn English and has already enrolled in classes.
Having been a keen cook and baker in Ukraine, she said she would like to start her own pastry business, and wants to volunteer to help other Ukrainian refugees settle.
She said her sons, aged between five and 15, were looking forward to beginning school.
But the devastation continuing in her own country where many of her family members and friends are still remains a source of fear and turmoil, she said.
""As a nation we haven't stopped fighting but its very difficult,"" she said.
""Just a couple of days ago I saw a 23-year-old boy from my village had been buried after being killed by the invaders.""
Presenting Ms Onopa with the keys, Archbishop of Cardiff George Stack said: ""This is an opportunity to say to our new family croesi i Gymru, welcome to Wales. The land of sanctuary.
""And we hope and pray that you will be happy and fulfilled and content as you begin to understand what wonderful people live and work in Wales.""
Chair of governors, Phil Cotterell said: ""Lilia and her family will not be alone, there is an incredible network of support here in Chepstow.""A Ukrainian mother and her six children who fled Russian bombing have been handed the keys to their new home.
Lilia Onopa, 43, and her children received an official welcome in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on Friday.
She tearfully described seeing her hometown destroyed, people killed, and wanting to save her sons.
Having fled their home north of Dnipro, where military strikes began in early March, Ms Onopa and her boys travelled to Bucharest, Romania.
This was after attacks on the port city of Odesa made other methods of travel impossible.
They arrived in the Monmouthshire town last week after waiting five weeks for the British Embassy to approve their online application.
At the gathering, they were given the keys to a bungalow, a former caretaker's property which has been refurbished by volunteers from St Mary's RC Primary School and church with donations from across the area.
Speaking of the horrors she and her children had encountered after the war began, Ms Onopa thanked everyone who had helped them get to a place of safety, including the UK government who she said came to her aid when there were issues with their applications.
Ms Onopa said: ""The horrible situation happening to our country is because one person, one regime decided my country should not exist, that my nation should not exist.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now nearly into its fourth month.
It is worth remembering that many people, including perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin, did not expect it to last this long.
But instead of swiftly taking the capital Kyiv, Russia faced strong resistance and last month switched focus to trying to capture the eastern region known as the Donbas.
A US foreign policy adviser, Derek Chollet, says Russia has already suffered a ""strategic defeat"". ""Ukraine is stronger today and closer to the West,"" Mr Chollet says. ""And Nato is stronger as well.""
Despite this, fighting continues and shows no sign of ending, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"". You can see the latest mapping of the war here.
Mr Zelensky has also condemned a missile strike against a cultural centre in the Kharkiv region that reportedly injured seven people including an 11-year-old child, describing it as ""absolute evil, absolute stupidity"".
""What is in the heads of people who choose such targets?"" he said.
Central to Russian ambitions in Ukraine has been the city of Mariupol, which connects its eastern regions to the annexed Crimea.
Soldiers at the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city still in Ukrainian hands - say they have finally ended their defence.
They had vowed to fight until the end, but eventually were told they could get out and save their lives.
Since Monday, hundreds have left the site and taken to Russian-controlled towns. The exact number is not yet clear, though Russia claims almost 2,000 have surrendered.
What will happen next is still not clear.

The war has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down. Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks.
That pattern of costly gains and losses is now being repeated in the east of the country.
Russia has been making small but steady advances in the Donbas - the renewed focus of its offensive. But it's also suffered setbacks - as highlighted by the destruction earlier this month of dozens of Russian armoured vehicles trying to cross the Siversky Donets river.

Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.
Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant in the south of the country back to Ukraine - and if it won't pay, he said, then the electricity could be sent to Russia instead.
But a spokesman for Ukraine's state nuclear agency Energoatom told the BBC it would take years to link the plant to Russia.

Russia still exports large amounts of gas to Europe, despite being under unprecedented sanctions.
It will be exporting a little less after it halted supplies to Finland.
Finland has been refusing to pay for its supplies in roubles after Russia said ""unfriendly"" countries must do so in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by Western powers. It also follows an announcement that Finland will apply for Nato membership.
Is Europe ready for Russia turning off the taps? The European Commission says it has a plan. Reality Check has been taking a look at how reliant the world is on Russian energy. .
Meanwhile in Russia, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reported on an unusual public protest in a small town.
In Russko-Vysotskoye, Steve writes, ""there is not a great deal to see here, apart from the chicken farm and the church that was reduced to rubble in World War Two.
""But there is one thing in this town that is particularly eye-catching: the local shopping centre.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61524175;2022-05-20;Ukraine war: What might tip the balance?;"Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down. Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks.
Overall, Russia is still the dominant force and has significant military might - but there has been no swift victory as planned. Here, we take a closer look at some of the things which could tilt the outcome in favour of either party.
In the north, a Ukrainian counter-offensive has successfully pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv. In the south, Russia has all but cleared out the final pockets of resistance in the port city of Mariupol. Both have been costly in terms of military and civilian casualties, but neither is likely to prove decisive.
What's happened in Mariupol and Kharkiv highlights the ebb and flow of this conflict. That pattern of costly gains and losses is now being repeated in the east of the country.
Russia has been making small but steady advances in the Donbas - the renewed focus of its offensive. But it's also suffered setbacks - as highlighted by the destruction earlier this month of dozens of Russian armoured vehicles trying to cross the Siversky Donets river.
In the east, each side is exchanging heavy, grinding blows using artillery. Ben Barry, a former British Army brigadier who is now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says that will continue to be the case in the battle of the Donbas.
He predicts artillery will be the main cause of casualties on both sides for weeks and months to come. Western officials have highlighted significant Russian losses, but they have been less willing to give estimates of Ukrainian casualties.
Ukraine is now receiving Western-supplied heavy weapons - including US M777 howitzers. It has also been sent counter-artillery radar systems - to help find and target Russia's artillery lines. But Ukraine is still outgunned.
Russia has been using its artillery and rocket launchers to tie down Ukrainian forces who are dug in - along well prepared defensive lines. Russia has been pressing from two main directions - from Izyum in the north and from the west around the city of Severedonetsk. They have made limited advances in both directions.
Brig Barry says it appears that Russia is ""trying to bleed Ukraine dry"" by forcing it to concentrate its forces at key points, which can then be targeted by its artillery. Military analysts believe Ukraine is likely to have suffered significant casualties as a result.
However, he says Ukraine will still be able to use urban areas in the Donbas to slow down Russia's advances. Fighting in town and cities, as has been shown throughout this war, favours the defender.
Once again, as in Mariupol, Russia is likely to try to grind resistance down - with the now familiar pattern of using mass artillery strikes until there remains little to defend. Ukraine's President Zelensky has already said Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"" and has described life there as ""hell"". It's going to get worse.
Military experts though still believe that Russia lacks the number of troops it needs to make significant advances in the east. Redeploying forces from the fight in  Kharkiv and Mariupol is unlikely to make a difference.
Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says Russia is still short of manpower and in particular infantry. Russia has tried to reconstruct and combine some of its already battered units - dubbed ""Frankenstein's Forces"".
Unit cohesion and morale of tired and depleted units is likely to be poor. A recent UK Ministry of Defence intelligence assessment concluded that Russian commanders were facing pressure to achieve results quickly and as a result were likely to redistribute forces without adequate preparation.
The ministry said that risked ""further attrition"". It is already claimed that Russia has already lost around a third of its original invasion force - an estimate that includes killed and wounded troops as well as equipment destroyed or damaged.
Mr Watling says Russia is trying to address these shortages - including mobilising reserves who are over 40 years old and offering short-term contracts to fill its ranks. But training and rebuilding an army takes time.
Russia has also proved vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks on its supply lines. But Ukraine's capacity to do this is likely to be limited with the bulk of its forces tied down in defensive positions.
No one thinks this war will be over quickly. It's not yet a stalemate. Russia is making advances - but very slowly. But the outcome of this war is unlikely to depend on military might alone.
Mr Watling says Russia is also pursuing economic and political levers to inflict as much damage on Ukraine as possible. While Russia's economy is taking a hit from Western sanctions, Ukraine's is likely to suffer even more.
Russia's GDP is expected to shrink by 12% over the next year, but Ukraine's GDP could fall by 50%. Russia's blockade of the Black Sea is causing significant damage.
Mr Watling says continuing Western economic, as well as military, support could prove crucial. Will the public's interest in the war wane the longer it goes on - just as it did after 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists first seized parts of the Donbas?
Western governments now also have to worry about their own domestic challenges, including rising inflation, gas and oil prices and a cost of living crisis - caused in part by the war.
When winter approaches it will be harder for armies to fight. It may also prove more difficult for the world to weather an economic storm.Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down.

The policy aims to ensure all Ukrainian refugees who come to the island are provided with a ""safe, suitable and dignified"" sponsorship arrangement.
Deputy Rob Prow said a lot of work had been carried out to ensure the scheme worked for all involved.
The president of the committee for home affairs said ""we know there is a strong desire"" for the scheme to be in place as soon as possible.
""We expect further significant progress imminently which will then allow us to focus on the process of matching potential sponsors, who have appropriate accommodation available, with Ukrainian beneficiaries.""
The policy aims to create a ""positive relationship"" between the sponsor and Ukrainian, and to ensure they have access to appropriate community and public service support.
The states plan to introduce the scheme in a phased approach, with successful sponsors to be contacted in stages to ensure they are still able to offer support and accommodation.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61511446;2022-05-20;Ukraine war: The volunteer drivers risking their lives to save others;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Alexander is used to following tracks that are not shown on maps.
Knuckles white, he holds the steering wheel tightly as the van jolts down mud tracks and through undergrowth. These paths were once used by tractors or for scenic bike trips. Now any inch of them or the open fields could be mined, hit by shells or surrounded by military.
Alexander is just one of the volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war.
""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he tells me. ""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""
In the last few weeks the volunteers say they have seen more demand from people wanting to leave Kherson as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory. Arrivals tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out.
Evacuating the city has been difficult. The UN and the Red Cross told us they have not run any evacuation routes as they've been unable to get safety guarantees from both sides.
Instead, volunteer drivers like Alexander negotiate the checkpoints and routes without any formal agreements. We are using false names for both drivers travelling into Kherson to protect their identities.
""You must have a cold mind and a firm heart,"" says Oleg. ""Otherwise, you won't get to the final destination.""
Oleg used to be a builder. He greets us with a broad smile and a piece of salted fish, a gift from Kherson that he carried in the glove compartment. He returned last night. It was a tough journey.
""Every new ride gets harder and harder. The old routes are closed and we must look for new ones.""
Oleg explains the process he follows, checking all the passengers' passports and documents, carrying a first aid kit. But following a plan is nearly impossible. For the last two days they arrived at the checkpoint at 05:00, only to wait until evening along with what he estimates to be around 2,000 other vehicles. No one, he says, was let through.
""We decided to go the way that is not yet open, because there are active battles there. It's a very fast route and because the women and children were so exhausted, we had to take risks. It was agreed by all passengers.""
The team was lucky.
Two other vans are still in Kherson, trying to make the journey out. One is driven by Alexander. They haven't been heard from since last night.
The drivers are part of a volunteer organisation that sprung up from a Telegram channel called Odessa As It Is. In the group's evacuation hub, volunteers pile vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and nappies into rescue packs for new arrivals.
Julia Pogrebnaya, one of the key co-ordinators here, flicks anxiously through her phone as she shows us around. Normally the first to smile and laugh, today she is tense.
""I don't sleep,"" she says. ""I feel like I can't breathe out until the drivers are back. I worry about everything. We have a lot of responsibility.""
Does she worry that they are encouraging people to take big risks?
""We have to do it. As we speak now we have about 5,500 people on the list that want to be evacuated from Kherson, not even counting from the surrounding villages.""
Julia tells us she will let us know about the drivers. As we leave, I spot her sitting at her desk, one hand holding her phone, the other brushing away tears.
It was the first day of the war when Puryshev Mykhailo made the decision to go to Mariupol. He arrived with humanitarian products and left with evacuees. That was the first of his seven trips.
""If I had waited for a safe corridor, I probably would have waited until now,"" he tells me. ""After I spent six days in a bomb shelter watching what children in the city were going through, something broke in me. At that moment I decided I would continue to do these trips.
""I just do it because I feel like it needs to be done. And to be honest, I would never have imagined that I was capable of such a thing.""
Puryshev has filmed much of the last few weeks, from the smiling faces of the children he's evacuated to sheltering from shelling during a pick-up.
""Driving through the road, it can be difficult to distinguish what is dirt and what is a corpse,"" he says quietly.
""Sometimes it is both mixed together. I saw bodies wrapped in carpets, others buried right next to the entrance of the house. You try not to dwell on it because you have a goal, to take people out alive.""
In Odessa, there is news of the drivers.
After frantic calls to the military, the hub have heard that both drivers were hit. Following the same path Oleg had taken a few hours before, one driver was in Russian territory, they tell us, when he was shelled. He is in hospital in Ukrainian-held territory with a severe head injury, his skull fractured and part of his ear severed. One passenger died, another is also in hospital.
A few hours later, Alexander left Kherson travelling in convoy with a car, only to come across a tank that turned them back. The driver of the car, Alexander's friend, was shot in the head by a sniper. Alexander survived, rescuing a passenger from the car to his van before escaping through shelling.
When I speak to Julia, the team is shaken, but say they will continue.
""We had calls from people, crying for us to come,"" she tells me. ""We have no choice, but to help them.""Alexander is used to following tracks that are not shown on maps.
Knuckles white, he holds the steering wheel tightly as the van jolts down mud tracks and through undergrowth. These paths were once used by tractors or for scenic bike trips. Now any inch of them or the open fields could be mined, hit by shells or surrounded by military.
Alexander is just one of the volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war.
""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he tells me. ""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""
In the last few weeks the volunteers say they have seen more demand from people wanting to leave Kherson as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory. Arrivals tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out.
Evacuating the city has been difficult. The UN and the Red Cross told us they have not run any evacuation routes as they've been unable to get safety guarantees from both sides.
Instead, volunteer drivers like Alexander negotiate the checkpoints and routes without any formal agreements. We are using false names for both drivers travelling into Kherson to protect their identities.
""You must have a cold mind and a firm heart,"" says Oleg. ""Otherwise, you won't get to the final destination.""
Oleg used to be a builder. He greets us with a broad smile and a piece of salted fish, a gift from Kherson that he carried in the glove compartment. He returned last night. It was a tough journey.
""Every new ride gets harder and harder. The old routes are closed and we must look for new ones.""
Oleg explains the process he follows, checking all the passengers' passports and documents, carrying a first aid kit. But following a plan is nearly impossible. For the last two days they arrived at the checkpoint at 05:00, only to wait until evening along with what he estimates to be around 2,000 other vehicles. No one, he says, was let through.
""We decided to go the way that is not yet open, because there are active battles there. It's a very fast route and because the women and children were so exhausted, we had to take risks. It was agreed by all passengers.""
The team was lucky.
Two other vans are still in Kherson, trying to make the journey out. One is driven by Alexander. They haven't been heard from since last night.
The drivers are part of a volunteer organisation that sprung up from a Telegram channel called Odessa As It Is. In the group's evacuation hub, volunteers pile vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and nappies into rescue packs for new arrivals.
Julia Pogrebnaya, one of the key co-ordinators here, flicks anxiously through her phone as she shows us around. Normally the first to smile and laugh, today she is tense.
""I don't sleep,"" she says. ""I feel like I can't breathe out until the drivers are back. I worry about everything. We have a lot of responsibility.""
Does she worry that they are encouraging people to take big risks?
""We have to do it. As we speak now we have about 5,500 people on the list that want to be evacuated from Kherson, not even counting from the surrounding villages.""
Julia tells us she will let us know about the drivers. As we leave, I spot her sitting at her desk, one hand holding her phone, the other brushing away tears.
It was the first day of the war when Puryshev Mykhailo made the decision to go to Mariupol. He arrived with humanitarian products and left with evacuees. That was the first of his seven trips.
""If I had waited for a safe corridor, I probably would have waited until now,"" he tells me. ""After I spent six days in a bomb shelter watching what children in the city were going through, something broke in me. At that moment I decided I would continue to do these trips.
""I just do it because I feel like it needs to be done. And to be honest, I would never have imagined that I was capable of such a thing.""
Puryshev has filmed much of the last few weeks, from the smiling faces of the children he's evacuated to sheltering from shelling during a pick-up.
""Driving through the road, it can be difficult to distinguish what is dirt and what is a corpse,"" he says quietly.
""Sometimes it is both mixed together. I saw bodies wrapped in carpets, others buried right next to the entrance of the house. You try not to dwell on it because you have a goal, to take people out alive.""
In Odessa, there is news of the drivers.
After frantic calls to the military, the hub have heard that both drivers were hit. Following the same path Oleg had taken a few hours before, one driver was in Russian territory, they tell us, when he was shelled. He is in hospital in Ukrainian-held territory with a severe head injury, his skull fractured and part of his ear severed. One passenger died, another is also in hospital.
A few hours later, Alexander left Kherson travelling in convoy with a car, only to come across a tank that turned them back. The driver of the car, Alexander's friend, was shot in the head by a sniper. Alexander survived, rescuing a passenger from the car to his van before escaping through shelling.

Both countries submitted their applications to be part of the Western defence alliance this week, marking a major shift in European geopolitics.
To join the alliance, the two nations need the support of all 30 Nato member states.
But the move by the Nordic nations has been opposed by Turkey.
Speaking alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto at the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden called Sweden and Finland's applications ""a watershed moment in European security"".
""New members joining Nato is not a threat to any nation,"" he said. The president added that having two new members in the ""high north"" would ""enhance the security of our allies and deepen our security co-operation across the board"".
Russia has repeatedly said it sees Nato as a threat and has warned of ""consequences"" if the block proceeds with its expansion plans.
Turkey has accused both Sweden and Finland of hosting suspected militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation.
However, both Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and British Defence Minister Ben Wallace have expressed confidence that these concerns will eventually be addressed.
Mr Biden's comments came as the US Senate voted to approve a new $40bn (£32bn) bill to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It is the biggest emergency aid package so far for Ukraine.
The bill - which was passed by the House of Representatives with broad bipartisan support on 10 May - was expected to be passed earlier this week, but was blocked by Kentucky Republican Rand Paul over a dispute about spending oversight.
But the Republican's Senate leader Mitch McConnell dismissed these concerns and told reporters that Congress had a ""moral responsibility"" to support ""a sovereign democracy's self-defence"".
""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,"" Mr McConnell said.
Last week, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Congress to approve the package and warned that the US military only had enough funds to send weapons to Kyiv until 19 May.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the aid package as ""a significant US contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"".
The package brings the total US aid delivered to Ukraine to more than $50bn, including $6bn for security assistance such as training, equipment, weapons and support.
Another $8.7bn will be allocated to replenish stocks of US equipment already sent to Ukraine.Sweden and Finland have the ""full, total and complete backing"" of the US in their decision to apply for Nato membership, President Joe Biden says.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russian forces of carrying out a missile strike against a cultural centre in the Kharkiv region, describing the attack as ""absolute evil, absolute stupidity"".
Zelensky posted a dramatic video of the moment missiles hit the newly-renovated House of Culture in Lozova on his Telegram channel.

The French carmaker said it would sell its 68% interest to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow.
Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property.
It is the first Russian nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine.
""Agreements were signed on the transfer of Russian assets of the Renault Group to the Russian Federation and the government of Moscow,"" Russia's industry and trade ministry said.
Financial details of the deal were not provided, but in April Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Renault planned to sell its Russian assets for ""one symbolic rouble"".
In a statement on Monday, Renault Group said its board of directors had approved agreements to sell Renault Russia to the Moscow city entity, as well as its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to the Russian Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute (Nami).
The deal also included Renault's Moscow plant, Avtoframos, which makes Renault and Nissan models.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said production at the plant would now resume under the Soviet-era Moskvich brand.
Renault boss Luca de Meo said: ""Today, we have taken a difficult but necessary decision; and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia, while preserving the group's performance and our ability to return to the country in the future, in a different context.""
The agreement, which Renault said would cost the company an estimated €2.2bn ($2.29bn), includes an option for the group to buy back its interest in Avtovaz for six years.
Avtovaz is Russia's largest carmaker and makes the country's popular Lada brand.
In March, Renault announced it was suspending operations at its Moscow factory.
It came after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Renault and other French companies to leave Russia, accusing them of ""financing the murders of women and children"".
Renault's chief executive Luca de Meo said the firm was making a responsible choice - but just how much choice did it actually have?
In the early stages of the conflict, the company prevaricated, choosing to remain in Russia while other international brands were leaving.
But after being name-checked by Ukraine's President Zelensky, who said Western firms in Russia were helping to finance Vladimir Putin's war, it suspended its operations in late March.
Abandoning its Russian business will be costly - Renault's own estimate is $2.3bn. It will lose a major market once seen as a key avenue for growth. And it will lose Lada as well - a brand that was central to Renault's strategy for affordable cars.
Arguably, Renault could not remain in Russia. Yet the damage to its reputation has already been severe.
Hundreds of international brands including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple have left Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February, with many now looking to sell their businesses in the country.

Twitter has said it plans to put misleading tweets from official accounts about the Ukraine war behind warning notices.
The change follows heightened scrutiny of the social media platform after the war unleashed a new surge of misinformation, sometimes from government sources.
Twitter has already limited content from more than 300 Russian government accounts, including President Putin.
But it also faces free speech concerns.
Under the company's new ""crisis"" policies, Twitter will prioritise labelling false posts from accounts with wide reach, like state media or official government accounts, while preserving them for ""accountability"" reasons.
Users will be required to click through the warning notice to view the post and Twitter will disable the ability to like, retweet or share the content.
Twitter said it would also change its search and explore features to avoid amplifying false tweets.
""While this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis,"" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of security and safety wrote in a blog post announcing the changes.
Twitter said examples of problematic posts included false or misleading allegations of war crimes, false information regarding the international response and false allegations regarding use of force.
The company said it would rely on multiple sources to determine when claims are misleading. Strong commentary and first person accounts are among the types of tweets that would not be challenged by the policy, it said.
The new policies come just weeks after Twitter's board agreed to a $44bn (£34.5bn) takeover offer from billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has called for less moderated speech on the platform.
He has said he would revoke Twitter's controversial ban of former US President Donald Trump, whom Twitter suspended citing the risk that he would incite further violence.
by Mike Wendling, BBC Disinformation Unit
Social media companies don't want to act as referees of the truth, but they now have so much power over what we see that they feel increasingly compelled to act as information judge and jury.
Twitter's new crisis policies are geared towards war and conflict. It's hard not to see them through the lens of war in Ukraine, where there's been an intense information war.
But of course there are other conflicts where these rules might apply - take Myanmar, where a civil war rages and where social media played a key role in a deadly slaughter, according to the UN.
Announcing a rule is one thing, but implementing it is another. The company uses automated systems but user reporting is rather limited. Twitter has only rolled out its misinformation reporting tool to the US and handful of other countries.
And of course, there's another event on the horizon that could easily change things.
You may have heard Twitter might have a new owner soon - one whose views tend to be more laissez-faire than the current management.
We don't yet have a very clear idea of what Elon Musk will do about moderation - if he does eventually take control.
Mr Roth said Twitter had started working on the new policies for crisis situations before the invasion of Ukraine, though the conflict had highlighted their importance.
Early in the war, the company took steps to limit the reach of Russian media accounts. But it did not have a clear approach to disinformation spread by political figures or government accounts.
While moderators did remove some posts, experts called the lack of strategy regarding government propaganda a ""critical gap"" in the firm's moderation policies.
Last month Twitter said it had identified more than 300 Russian government accounts that it would stop recommending in timelines, notifications or elsewhere on the site.
On a call with reporters, Mr Roth said the firm had seen ""both sides share information that may be misleading and/or deceptive"".
""Our policy doesn't draw a distinction between the different combatants,"" he said. ""Instead, we're focusing on misinformation that could be dangerous, regardless of where it comes from.""Twitter has said it plans to put misleading tweets from official accounts about the Ukraine war behind warning notices.
The change follows heightened scrutiny of the social media platform after the war unleashed a new surge of misinformation, sometimes from government sources.
Twitter has already limited content from more than 300 Russian government accounts, including President Putin.
But it also faces free speech concerns.
Under the company's new ""crisis"" policies, Twitter will prioritise labelling false posts from accounts with wide reach, like state media or official government accounts, while preserving them for ""accountability"" reasons.
Users will be required to click through the warning notice to view the post and Twitter will disable the ability to like, retweet or share the content.
Twitter said it would also change its search and explore features to avoid amplifying false tweets.
""While this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis,"" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of security and safety wrote in a blog post announcing the changes.
Twitter said examples of problematic posts included false or misleading allegations of war crimes, false information regarding the international response and false allegations regarding use of force.
The company said it would rely on multiple sources to determine when claims are misleading. Strong commentary and first person accounts are among the types of tweets that would not be challenged by the policy, it said.
The new policies come just weeks after Twitter's board agreed to a $44bn (£34.5bn) takeover offer from billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has called for less moderated speech on the platform.
He has said he would revoke Twitter's controversial ban of former US President Donald Trump, whom Twitter suspended citing the risk that he would incite further violence.

Social media companies don't want to act as referees of the truth, but they now have so much power over what we see that they feel increasingly compelled to act as information judge and jury.
Twitter's new crisis policies are geared towards war and conflict. It's hard not to see them through the lens of war in Ukraine, where there's been an intense information war.
But of course there are other conflicts where these rules might apply - take Myanmar, where a civil war rages and where social media played a key role in a deadly slaughter, according to the UN.
Announcing a rule is one thing, but implementing it is another. The company uses automated systems but user reporting is rather limited. Twitter has only rolled out its misinformation reporting tool to the US and handful of other countries.
And of course, there's another event on the horizon that could easily change things.

Nato's secretary general says Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to plan and that its attempt to capture the eastern Donbas region has ""stalled"".
Jens Stoltenberg also said Ukraine could win the conflict.
Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February.
The Russian invasion has been hampered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues.
Its initial goal appeared to be to sweep across the country and topple the Ukrainian government. Instead, Russia has withdrawn from areas around the capital Kyiv after failing to capture it and since mid-April has been focusing its efforts on two eastern provinces.
In Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, officials say Russian forces have withdrawn from to the border and that residents were returning.
""Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,"" said Mr Stoltenberg.
""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives.""
Mr Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers.
On top of the military setbacks, another consequence of the invasion is that Russia will likely face an expanded Nato with Sweden and Finland set to join.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Nato as a security threat to Russia and invaded Ukraine in part to stop it joining Nato.
In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured.
The MoD said Russia's Donbas offensive had ""lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"".
It said Russia was constrained by ""continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61442387;2022-05-15;Ukraine: The children's camp that became an execution ground;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Since Russian forces were pushed back from Kyiv at the end of March, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha region - many hastily buried in shallow graves. The BBC has learned that around 650 people were shot in what a senior police official has described as executions. Sarah Rainsford has been investigating what happened at a children's summer camp - now being treated as a crime scene.
*This report contains material some readers will find disturbing*
It is easy to miss the killing spot at first in the gloom. But in a cold, damp basement on the edge of the woods that made Bucha a popular get-away spot before the war, five Ukrainian men were forced to their knees and shot in the head.
To the right of the entrance, there are stones coated in blood that has turned dark red. Lying among that is a blue woollen hat with an exit hole in one side and its rim soaked in blood. In the wall, I counted at least a dozen bullet holes.
A couple of steps away are the remains of a Russian military ration pack - an open can of rice porridge with beef and an empty packet of crackers. A name daubed in graffiti on a wall is a reminder that the scene is a children's camp. But when Russian troops moved into Bucha, just outside the capital, in early March, Camp Radiant became an execution ground.
The story of the summer camp killings is chilling but so is this detail: more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the Bucha region during a month under Russian occupation, but most did not die from shrapnel or shelling. More than 650 were shot dead by Russian soldiers, according to a senior police official.
Now Ukraine is searching for their killers.
Volodymyr Boichenko lived in Hostomel, just up the road from Bucha and near the airfield where the first Russian forces landed to try to overthrow Ukraine's government. When his sister Aliona Mykytiuk decided to flee before the fighting reached her, she pleaded with Volodymyr to join her. He was a civilian, not a soldier, but he wanted to stay and help. So he spent the days searching Hostomel for food and water to bring to neighbours, including children, who were trapped in their cellars by the constant shelling and Russian airstrikes.
A chatty 34-year-old, who had travelled the world in the merchant navy, Volodymyr phoned his family from Hostomel most days to reassure them he was safe. Aliona would wait nervously for his brief calls: she knew he had to move to higher ground to get a connection and if the shelling was heavy it was impossible to leave the bomb shelter. As supplies ran low, she urged her brother to try to escape but by then the roads were blocked.
The last time Aliona heard from him was on 8 March. Volodymyr wasn't the demonstrative type, but that day he told his sister not to worry about him. ""He said 'I really love you,' and that was so painful to hear,"" Aliona sobs, rubbing her eyes hard but unable to stop the tears. ""There was fear in his voice.""
Four days later, Volodymyr was spotted by neighbours close to Promenystyi, as it's known here, or Camp Radiant. Then he disappeared.
In March, the fighting around Kyiv was intense and the small town of Bucha was at the epicentre. The withdrawal of Russian troops in early April revealed scenes that shocked the world: the bodies of residents slumped in the streets where they'd been shot.
Moscow tells anyone who will listen that the killings were staged, an idea that is as twisted as it is patently false. Determined to hold those responsible to account, Ukrainian investigators are busy collecting the hard evidence on territory now back under their control.
""We don't know what Putin's plans are, so we are working as quickly as possible in case he drops a bomb and destroys all the proof,"" says Kyiv regional police chief, Andrii Niebytov.
That evidence includes a field full of civilian cars pierced with multiple bullet holes, now piled up on the edge of Bucha. They are vehicles that were shot at when families tried to flee. One still has a length of white cloth at the window, hung to show the soldiers that its occupants were no threat. Step too close, and you catch the sickly smell of death.
When the bodies beneath Camp Radiant were discovered on 4 April, Volodymyr Boichenko was among them. Aliona had spent weeks frantically calling hospitals and morgues. That day she was sent a photograph to identify. She knew it was her brother before it had even downloaded.
""I hate them with every cell of my being,"" Aliona cries, about Volodymyr's killers. ""I know that's wrong to say about people, but they are not human. There was not one patch on those men's bodies that was not beaten.""
The five men had been found crouching on their knees, heads down and hands bound behind their backs.
""We know they had been tortured,"" the police chief told the BBC. ""The Russian army has crossed the line of how war is conducted. They were not fighting the military in Ukraine, they were kidnapping and torturing the civilian population.""
Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the SBU security service will disclose details of ongoing investigations, but some Russian military were so careless at covering their tracks that there are likely to be considerable clues to work with. Ukrainian territorial defence units have even discovered lists of soldiers at some abandoned positions. One appears to be part of a rota for litter duty, another includes passport details and mobile phone numbers.
With such a vast volume of work - more than 11,000 potential war crimes cases registered so far - Ukraine's security services have called on more digitally savvy civilians for help.
""I feel some call of duty,"" said Dmytro Replianchuk, a journalist at slidstvo.info who worked to expose corruption within Ukraine's law enforcement bodies before the war. Now he's joined forces with prosecutors, scouring the internet for extra data to help catch suspected war criminals.
""I understand it will be so hard and a lot of cases won't be solved. But in these weeks, it's important to find as much information as possible,"" Dmytro explained.
We found one potential clue among the litter at Camp Radiant - the wrapping from a parcel sent by a woman named Ksyukha to a Russian soldier whose own name and military unit are clearly marked. Unit 6720 is based in Rubtsovsk, in the Altai region of Siberia. It has been linked to Bucha before when soldiers from the town were caught on CCTV sending giant packages to relatives full of goods that they had looted from Ukrainian homes.
We can't be sure yet whether soldiers from Rubtsovsk were based at the children's camp, or were there when the men were killed. The police first need to establish a more precise time of death.
""We are working on it, but it's not a quick thing,"" Mr Niebytov  explains. ""But that camp was a headquarters so there would have been a commander. The soldiers could not have executed anyone without the commander's knowledge. So we will first find the organisers and then look for the implementers.""
Across the road from Camp Radiant, behind a church spattered with shrapnel damage, a corner of Bucha is slowly showing renewed signs of life. Young boys run around the yard, while a man fixes sheets of wood to windows shattered when the town was being shelled, constantly. And a little shop has just reopened to serve others now trickling back to begin their own repairs.
As neighbours cross paths, they discuss the days when Russian tanks rolled into their town, the soldiers who would shoot wildly and those who roamed the streets drunk, breaking into homes and stealing from them. And they remember the local man who escaped to their block of flats from the summer camp opposite, and who they had sheltered despite the risk.
Viktor Sytnytskyi didn't know Camp Radiant before, but all the details he gives match up. He's now in western Ukraine and told me his story over the phone, calling from his car so he wouldn't upset his mother.
It was early March when Viktor was grabbed by Russian soldiers on the street. They tied his hands and pulled his hat down over his eyes, then dragged him to a cellar that he's sure was on the grounds of the children's camp.
There, the Russians poured water over his legs so he would freeze, and they held a gun to his head.
""They kept saying, 'Where's the fascists? Where's the troops? Where's Zelensky? One of them mentioned Putin so I said something rude and he hit me,"" Viktor recalls.
He remembers being angry at his captors as well as terrified. He had worked in Moscow in the past with men from Siberia and was horrified that Russians could now treat him with such brutality. Even more so, when one of the soldiers revealed that he, too, was from Siberia.
Viktor told him he was sad things had come to this.
""The sad thing is that our grandfathers fought together against the Nazis and now you're the fascists,"" was the Russian's angry reply.
""He told me: 'You have until the morning to remember what you've seen, and if not, you'll be shot.'""
That night, Viktor got lucky. There was heavy shelling and when he realised his captors were no longer guarding him, he ran for his life.
""I calculated that I had more chance of surviving under shelling than if I stayed in that cellar. They'd already put the gun to my head. What would it cost them to pull the trigger?""
From a common grave beneath the children's camp, Volodymyr Boichenko has now been given a proper burial beneath the cherry blossom in the old cemetery of Bucha.
After his funeral, Aliona says she finally saw her brother's face in her dreams again, as if he were comforting her.
But she still has many questions. The cross on Volodymyr's grave is marked only with his birthday, not the date of his death, because the family have no idea when he was shot.
They may never know, unless the Russian commander who took over Camp Radiant can be found.
Like everyone in Bucha, though, they do know that civilians are not only caught up in this war. They are being targeted - by Russian soldiers who either don't know the rules of war, or don't care.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Investigators have been searching for evidence of alleged Russian war crimes, in apartment blocks in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians.Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians.Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.

""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.

It will host Al Rayyan Sports Club, with a 20,000 capacity, after the tournament.Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians.Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""

Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.

""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.
Venue: Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium
Capacity: 40,000
Games: Seven, up to last 16
Location: Al Rayyan, 20km west of Doha
This stadium was built on the site of an old ground with the same name - with more than 80% of the construction materials reused or recycled - including from the initial ground.
Its glowing facade is ""comprised of patterns that characterise different aspects of the country"".
It will host Al Rayyan Sports Club, with a 20,000 capacity, after the tournament."

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61691816;2022-06-04;Ukraine anger as Macron says 'Don't humiliate Russia';"Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians.Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.
