Last October, I sat in the office of Klaus Emmerich—the chief union representative at the Garzweiler brown-coal mine, in western Germany—as he shared his misgivings about the country’s celebrated plan to stop burning coal. Germany’s buildup of renewable energy was lagging, and, given that coal accounts for more than a quarter of its total electricity supply, that meant it would have to rely on another energy source for the time being: natural gas, which came mostly from Russia. “We’re giving ourselves over to the Russians,” Emmerich told me. “I have a bad feeling about it.”
Ostpolitik, or “eastern policy,” dates back to Willy Brandt, who led the Social Democrats (known by their German acronym, the S.P.D.) into power in West Germany in 1969. His embrace of détente and diplomatic outreach to East Germany and the Soviet Union was born of a combination of pragmatism in the face of a nuclear-armed threat, guilt over the Nazis’ unfathomable destruction on the Eastern Front, and a desire to show at least some independence from the country’s chief ally and protector, the United States.
In hindsight, Germany’s complacency toward Putin’s abuses and consolidation of power looks feckless. But there was little public appetite in Germany for confrontation. Behrends described Merkel’s soft stance as a form of “silent populism.” She sensed that the Germans, basking in peace and prosperity, would not support upending the status quo. “She was popular with Germans because she didn’t disturb their need for Bequemlichkeit, their comfort zone,” he told me.
Olaf Scholz is an unlikely figure to lead Germany’s abrupt break with its postwar maxim “Es gibt keine militärische Lösung” (“There is no military solution”). This past summer, when I saw him speak at a campaign rally in Berlin, he struck me as a politician in the mold of an old-fashioned Midwestern Democrat, like Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown: progressive but measured, comfortable in his own skin, self-effacing, motivated above all by domestic concerns. (Like Brown, Scholz spoke often of restoring “respect” to the non-college-educated workers who had been drifting away from his party.) There was barely any mention of Russia, or foreign policy in general, during the campaign’s televised debates.
Scholz’s military shift calls for an immediate expenditure of a hundred billion euros on the armed forces and, in years ahead, a return to spending more than two per cent of G.D.P. on defense. Reaching the two-per-cent threshold would meet Germany’s commitment to NATO.

Five months later, Emmerich’s premonitions have been borne out, powerfully. President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has unleashed civilian and military carnage, ravaged cities, and sent some two million people fleeing the country. As its effects have rippled across Europe and the world, one has gone underexamined: the invasion has upended the political and economic policies of Germany, where the government has reconsidered its long-planned energy transition, undone a congenial political stance toward Russia that lasted for half a century, and reversed a policy of military minimalism that dates to the end of the Second World War. In many ways, Germany has rethought its place in the world—all in two weeks.

At the heart of the shift is Germany’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels—which, until recently, was not seen as problematic by German leaders. Quite the opposite: it was part of a deliberate, decades-long effort by Germany to maintain comity with the huge, nuclear-armed neighbor against whom it fought in two bloody twentieth-century wars. Germany chose its dependence on Russia because it saw the economic links created by fuel imports—physical links, in the form of pipelines through Eastern Europe and under the Baltic Sea—as integral to keeping peace and integrating Russia into the rest of Europe.
On February 22nd, Germany’s new Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a curtailment of that dependence on Russian energy. The country was halting Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia that would be capable of providing Europe with fifty-five billion cubic metres of gas per year, at a time when the rest of the Continent’s gas production is declining. Not only would this leave Germany without a crucial source for its energy supply; it was an admission that the strategy of Ostpolitik—accommodation with Russia, which Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party had embraced, at least in spirit, for more than fifty years—was a failure.
On February 27th, Scholz made an even more stunning declaration. After having already decided to send heavy weaponry to Ukraine, Germany would vastly increase its defense spending—by one estimate, making it the third largest military spender in the world, after the U.S. and China—and shift its entire posture toward military engagement. “President Putin created a new reality with his invasion of Ukraine,” Scholz said. “This new reality requires a clear response. We have given it.”
The following day, Finance Minister Christian Lindner told the broadcaster ARD that Germany would now “get one of the most capable, most powerful armies in Europe, one of the best-equipped armies in Europe in the course of this decade.” More than seventy-five years after the Nazis were vanquished, Germany would allow itself to think and act as a regional power again, complete with pride in its military capability. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a senior member of the historically pacifist-inclined Green Party, said, “If our world is different, then our politics must also be different.” It is hard to overstate the magnitude of this shift, which has left many Germans in shock. “I don’t think I’ve seen anything like it in my political life,” Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, the vice-president of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund think tank and a former senior government adviser, told me. “It’s staggering.”
Ostpolitik, or “eastern policy,” dates back to Willy Brandt, who led the Social Democrats (known by their German acronym, the S.P.D.) into power in West Germany in 1969. His embrace of détente and diplomatic outreach to East Germany and the Soviet Union was born of a combination of pragmatism in the face of a nuclear-armed threat, guilt over the Nazis’ unfathomable destruction on the Eastern Front, and a desire to show at least some independence from the country’s chief ally and protector, the United States.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unravelling of the Soviet Union, the policy was widely judged a rousing success, credited by many Germans with having helped bring about the end of the Cold War. “Germans thought that, because the Wall came down peacefully, that Ostpolitik was right,” Kristine Berzina, also with the German Marshall Fund, told me. “Their lived experience was that those relations led to the right outcome, and that meant that making sure that the gas keeps flowing was paramount not only for the German economy but that it was the right strategic decision.” To Berzina and others, though, this was an inaccurate and  fateful misremembering of Ostpolitik and an overstatement of its role in the fall of the Iron Curtain.
The policy depended both on diplomacy and military strength, according to Jan Behrends, a loyal S.P.D. member who has served on the Party’s historical commission. In Behrends’s view, Brandt was no “hippie peacenik”; he was a Cold Warrior who had, in the late nineteen-forties, lived through the Soviet blockade of Berlin. In 1970, when Brandt paid his first state visit to Moscow, West Germany was spending more than three per cent of its G.D.P. on the military and had half a million people under arms. “They took him seriously because Brezhnev looked at him and saw that he was head of the most important fighting force in Western Europe,” Behrends, a historian at the European University Viadrina, in eastern Germany, said.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Germany kept up with Ostpolitik, and the country’s military spending slipped below 1.5 per cent of G.D.P., even as signs mounted that Russia was on an alarming trajectory under Putin, who, in the nineteen-nineties, levelled Grozny, in Chechnya, and presided over a regime that saw disturbing numbers of dissidents persecuted and journalists murdered. Germany further expanded its energy ties with Russia. Angela Merkel, whose center-right Christian Democrats won the 2005 election and led a coalition government with the S.P.D., agreed to carry on with the construction of the first Nord Stream. The S.P.D. Chancellor she unseated, Gerhard Schröder, became the chairman of the subsidiary overseeing construction of the pipeline, in which Russia’s Gazprom held a fifty-one-per-cent stake.
As Chancellor, Merkel continued to protect the country’s investment in Russian energy even as more ominous signs emerged: Putin’s speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference decrying the expansion of NATO, Russia’s bombardment of Georgia in 2008, its annexation of Crimea and fuelling of the conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014, the murder of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. (One disturbing episode even occurred inside Germany. In 2019, a Georgian citizen was killed by a bike-riding assassin, alleged to be a former colonel in the Russian intelligence service, in broad daylight at a Berlin park.)
Yet Germany’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels only increased. After the Fukushima disaster, in 2011, Merkel committed to closing all of Germany’s nuclear plants in a little more than a decade. At the time, nuclear energy was providing nearly a quarter of the country’s electricity. “When we closed down nuclear, they must have drunk champagne in the Kremlin,” Behrends said. “That’s when we gave up our energy sovereignty.”
Behrends doesn’t just blame Merkel. In 2014 and 2015, the U.S. essentially deputized the German Chancellor to handle its Russia policy during negotiations in Minsk to end the fighting in the Donbas region. (Merkel grew up in East Germany, where Putin worked for the K.G.B., and speaks Russian. Among journalists, she was known as the “Putin whisperer.”) “Why did they outsource their Russia policy to Merkel and trust her so much?” Behrends asked. “If the U.S. had sat at the table, they would have carried much more weight, but they weren’t there.”
In hindsight, Germany’s complacency toward Putin’s abuses and consolidation of power looks feckless. But there was little public appetite in Germany for confrontation. Behrends described Merkel’s soft stance as a form of “silent populism.” She sensed that the Germans, basking in peace and prosperity, would not support upending the status quo. “She was popular with Germans because she didn’t disturb their need for Bequemlichkeit, their comfort zone,” he told me.
Looming above all, of course, was the boundless shame of the Third Reich, which left many Germans intent on moral repentance. Within the country, there has long been a divide over what this repentance should entail, roughly aligned in two camps: those who believe that Germany should never permit itself to return to totalitarianism (“never again dictatorship” or “never again Auschwitz”), and those who believe that Germany should never engage in any war, full stop. With a few exceptions, such as Germany’s limited participation in NATO’s operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan, the “never again war” camp has held sway.
Germany was further restrained by a regional political dynamic that came into play post-reunification. Former East Germans, who had endured the Red Army’s depredations at the end of the Second World War in ways that the rest of the country had not, were deeply wary of antagonizing Russia. Some also felt betrayed by western Germany for having abandoned its promises of vast economic aid in the east following reunification, which created some sympathy for Putin’s claims to having been cheated by the West.
Olaf Scholz is an unlikely figure to lead Germany’s abrupt break with its postwar maxim “Es gibt keine militärische Lösung” (“There is no military solution”). This past summer, when I saw him speak at a campaign rally in Berlin, he struck me as a politician in the mold of an old-fashioned Midwestern Democrat, like Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown: progressive but measured, comfortable in his own skin, self-effacing, motivated above all by domestic concerns. (Like Brown, Scholz spoke often of restoring “respect” to the non-college-educated workers who had been drifting away from his party.) There was barely any mention of Russia, or foreign policy in general, during the campaign’s televised debates.
Scholz assumed the Chancellorship in December, and his allies sent more weapons to Ukraine. Germany was ridiculed for promising only helmets. As the U.S. prepared sanctions against Russia, Germany equivocated on the fate of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
On February 15th, Scholz visited Putin at the Kremlin. The experience of listening “to Putin unplugged” for hours likely helped transform Scholz, Kleine-Brockhoff said. “He got a good education from Vladimir the Great.” A week later, Putin recognized the two separatist regions in Ukraine, and Russian forces invaded. Behrends’s S.P.D. sources have told him that Scholz discussed the substance of his landmark speech on military spending with few beyond his closest advisers, which made for good theatre in the Bundestag: members who might have decried such a major shift were caught unawares, and were carried along from applauding Scholz’s generalities about supporting Ukraine to applauding rhetoric whose import registered too late.
After the speech, applause poured in from Germany’s allies, too. A little more than three decades after Margaret Thatcher and François Mitterrand warned against German reunification, the leaders of the Western alliance were a generation removed from living through the Second World War and German military aggression. Their countries, the U.S., and others were desperate for Western Europe’s largest country to step up. “It represents the moment when Germany became comfortable—and found it inevitable—to become a military power, and when others around Germany became comfortable with that decision,” Kleine-Brockhoff said. “That was the momentous thing. You could hear the cheers from Paris and Warsaw. You could see the smiles from London and Washington.”
Scholz’s military shift calls for an immediate expenditure of a hundred billion euros on the armed forces and, in years ahead, a return to spending more than two per cent of G.D.P. on defense. Reaching the two-per-cent threshold would meet Germany’s commitment to NATO. (Putin’s actions might achieve what former President Donald Trump’s browbeating never did.)
Notably unresolved, though, is how Germany plans to survive with much less of the Russian fossil fuels it has sought all these years. According to Bloomberg, the country now relies on Russia for two-thirds of its natural gas, half its coal, and nearly a third of its oil. Extending reliance on nuclear energy won’t be an easy stopgap. Last fall, energy experts told me that prolonging the life of Germany’s three remaining nuclear plants wasn’t feasible; once the process of closing starts, it’s difficult to reverse. On Tuesday, Economy Minister Robert Habeck, a member of the Green Party, ruled out a nuclear extension.
The country could delay its exit from coal, but that would imperil its goals for sharply reducing carbon emissions. And electricity production is far from the only concern: natural gas is used to make fertilizer and, crucially, for home heating in the winter. So assured had Germany been in its Russian pipelines that it is only now building two terminals on the North Sea to receive liquefied natural gas from other countries. The terminals will take at least two years to complete, and the gas itself will likely be far costlier. (The European Union, as a whole, announced plans this week to reduce annual imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds.)
Berzina, of the German Marshall Fund, told me that the most immediate concern will be buying enough natural gas this summer to put in storage for next winter, at what will likely be painfully high prices. Beyond that, the country will need to invest heavily in switching as many households as possible from gas boilers to electric heating sources, which she said could cost thousands of dollars per home. To provide the energy for that additional electricity, she added, the country should reconsider its opposition to nuclear power, an aversion stemming from a combination of deeply rooted naturalist conceptions of the inviolability of German soil and Cold War-era fears about being caught in the middle of a nuclear war. “The moral imperative of Ukraine now outweighs this,” she told me.
That would represent a dramatic turnabout, but at the pace of current transformation in Germany, one shouldn’t rule out anything. During a recent forum, Kleine-Brockhoff was challenged by a participant who wanted to know how Germany could swing, in a matter of days, “from appeasement to brinkmanship.” “My answer is that it’s because it was so long in coming,” Kleine-Brockhoff told me. “Because the domestic debate lingered for years and got nowhere. Until the breaking point—and the breaking was the invasion.” He went on, “In the end, a democracy will defend itself and stand for democratic values. That I never doubted. The question is: Would it come too late?”

https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-growing-fear-of-a-wider-war-between-russia-and-the-west;2022-03-10;The Growing Fear of a Wider War Between Russia and the West;"U.S. officials warn that tensions over Ukraine could trigger a once unthinkable conflict pitting Russia against NATO.
On his visit to Poland last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken walked fifteen feet into Ukraine, as snow began to fall, to meet briefly with its foreign minister. It was symbolic of the Biden Administration’s deliberately calibrated policy—going up to the border, but not beyond—to avoid any move that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could perceive as provocative. “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the President also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe,” Blinken told “Meet the Press” the next day, from Moldova. Yet, just two weeks into the war, the U.S. increasingly fears being drawn into a war with Russia. The undercurrent to frantic diplomacy and waves of U.S. military deployments—thousands more troops dispatched to Europe, Patriot-missile batteries to Poland, and B-52 bombers flying over Central Europe—is the palpable fear that the unthinkable is now thinkable.On Tuesday, a new U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia will pursue its interests in “competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways, including pressing to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad.’ ” In testimony on the Hill, William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former Ambassador to Russia, was pressed about Vladimir Putin’s intent. “He’s not going to stop at Ukraine, correct?” asked Representative Jackie Speier, of California. Burns replied, “That’s what makes it more important than ever to demonstrate that he’s not going to succeed in Ukraine.” The stakes, Burns acknowledged, are bigger. “This is one of those pivotal points where we and all of our allies and partners need to act.”

Since Russia’s invasion, the besieged Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly warned the West about the danger that Putin would target other European nations. “Everyone thinks that we are far away from America or Canada. No, we are in this zone of freedom,” Zelensky said in a television interview, on Monday. “And, when the limits of rights and freedoms are being violated and stepped on, then you have to protect us. Because we will come first. You will come second. Because, the more this beast will eat, he wants more, more, and more.”
The U.S., however, pushed back this week on key military requests from Ukraine, for fear of Russia’s reaction. Putin’s reckless offensive has forced the U.S. to adopt awkward policy positions. On March 5th, Zelensky made an impassioned appeal to members of the House and Senate for more military aid, notably help in obtaining Soviet-era warplanes that Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly and that could balance Russia’s air superiority. On Wednesday, the Pentagon rejected an offer from Poland to turn over twenty-eight MIG-29 fighter jets to U.S. custody—flying them to a base in Germany—for transfer to Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials assessed that an American role in a transfer “may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters. U.S. involvement was deemed to be “high risk.” The majority of Ukraine’s warplanes are still intact, a senior Defense Department official added, while acknowledging that Russia’s surface-to-air missiles now have an “umbrella” that covers virtually all of Ukraine.
The Administration cited the same fears about Zelensky’s request for help from NATO in establishing a no-fly zone over part of Ukraine to protect civilians. “We also have to see to it that this war does not expand,” Blinken said on Wednesday, at a joint press conference with his British counterpart. “Our goal is to end the war, not to expand it, including potentially expand it to NATO territory.” Otherwise, he warned, “it’s going to turn even deadlier, involve more people, and I think potentially even make things harder to resolve in Ukraine itself.”
On Thursday, Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, acknowledged that the U.S. is now in a uniquely challenging position. “We are obviously providing enormous amounts of support to the Ukrainians, as we should and need to do,” she told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “But at the same time trying not to escalate the conflict into a full-on NATO or U.S. war with Russia. And that’s a challenging space to manage.”
Yet, at each of his four stops in NATO countries near Russia, Blinken heard dire predictions about the broader Russian threat beyond Ukraine—and the need for the U.S. to do more. In Riga, on Monday, the Latvian Foreign Minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, lamented to Blinken, “We have no illusions about Putin’s Russia anymore.” In Vilnius, the Lithuanian President, Gitanas Nauseda, turned to Blinken and said, “Deterrence is no longer enough. We need more defense here, because otherwise it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary. Putin will not stop in Ukraine; he will not stop.” And in Tallinn, on Tuesday, the Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, said that NATO countries “need to adapt to the new reality” of a “very aggressive Russia” and permanently strengthen their defenses in the air, on land, and at sea. Pressed on what specifically countries on Russia’s borders needed, she replied, “Everything.”
Eastern European countries—notably those once allied with, or part of, the former Soviet Union’s empire—have long warned of the potential for Russian aggression. “We, the Poles, are already tired of reminding everyone: ‘We told ya so,’ ” Marek Magierowski, Poland’s Ambassador to the U.S., told me in an interview this week. He cited the forewarning by the late Polish President Lech Kaczynski during the Russian invasion of Georgia, in 2008. “Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the day after tomorrow—the Baltic states and later, perhaps, time will come for my country, Poland,” Kaczynski had said.
Magierowski added, “We have never had any doubts whatsoever about Vladimir Putin’s neo-imperial ambitions.” Putin has been waiting for this “window of opportunity” for years, he said. “He convinced himself that the West is weak, divided, wallowing in a decadent mood. He thought the free world wouldn’t care about Ukraine’s fate, as it didn’t care about Czechoslovakia’s in 1938,” when Europe tolerated Nazi Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland. Putin, he told me, is similarly “emboldened” because the West was “tragically lenient” and “outrageously complacent” after Russia murdered the defector Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006; invaded and annexed Crimea, in 2014; helped destroy the Syrian city of Aleppo, in 2016; reportedly used chemical weapons to poison the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, in 2018; and poisoned the opposition leader Alexey Navalny, in 2020. Over the past three decades, Eastern Europeans have often encountered skepticism of their view of Putin as the U.S. and Western Europeans, notably the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, advocated dealing pragmatically with Russia.
During his European trip, Blinken repeatedly promised that NATO, this time, would prevent further Russian expansion. “We will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power,” he vowed, in Estonia. But U.S. experts worry, too, about an unintended incident triggering a wider war, like the spark that ignited the First World War, a conflict that dragged on for four years and killed tens of millions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “could easily escalate into a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and further west into Europe,” Thomas E. Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, warned in a new report issued on Tuesday. It might not matter what the U.S. does, he wrote. Crippling sanctions “could provoke Putin to lash out with greater violence,” Graham cautioned. But, if NATO appeared restrained, Moscow could be “tempted to press militarily even further into Europe” to enlarge its sphere of influence. The rippling impact of broader Russian aggression would stress “the geopolitical, economic, and institutional foundations” of the international order created after the Second World War, Graham wrote.
Given the Russian leader’s history, Angela Stent, a former National Intelligence officer and the author of “Putin’s World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest,” is worried about a miscalculation. “The concern we have to have immediately is that the war in Ukraine doesn’t inadvertently spread to Poland or Romania by some unforeseen clash, which would then have to involve NATO in a war with Russia,” she told me. Stent also worries about Putin’s intentions short of war. “You can use nonmilitary means to disrupt societies. And he’s already been doing that for the past couple of decades.” As the Russian leader grows increasingly cornered, she added, he will seek to exploit popular sentiment in countries like Serbia, where a pro-Russia march to support the war was held last week. The new U.S. intelligence assessment warns that Russia will employ “an array of tools” to undermine the interests of the U.S. and its NATO allies. “We expect Moscow to insert itself into crises” whenever it sees an opportunity, it concludes.
On Wednesday, the Biden Administration issued a forceful denial after Russia’s bizarre claim that the U.S. and Ukraine were developing chemical and biological weapons. The State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, said that Moscow has a long track record of accusing the U.S. of the very crimes that Russia is perpetrating. These tactics are “an obvious ploy” by Russia to try to justify “further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks,” he said.
Russia, as the aggressor, still has the upper hand. But, for the U.S. and its allies, the one positive sign is that the performance of the Ukrainian military has exceeded expectations. Russian forces have fallen far short of Putin’s goal of a swift seizure of Kyiv and the ouster of Zelensky’s government. The first two weeks have, instead, been grinding for Moscow. U.S. intelligence estimates that between two thousand and four thousand troops fighting for Russia—not all of them Russian—have died in the first two weeks. The bravery of Ukrainians, so far, has prevented the worst-case scenario.On his visit to Poland last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken walked fifteen feet into Ukraine, as snow began to fall, to meet briefly with its foreign minister. It was symbolic of the Biden Administration’s deliberately calibrated policy—going up to the border, but not beyond—to avoid any move that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could perceive as provocative. “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the President also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe,” Blinken told “Meet the Press” the next day, from Moldova. Yet, just two weeks into the war, the U.S. increasingly fears being drawn into a war with Russia. The undercurrent to frantic diplomacy and waves of U.S. military deployments—thousands more troops dispatched to Europe, Patriot-missile batteries to Poland, and B-52 bombers flying over Central Europe—is the palpable fear that the unthinkable is now thinkable.
On Tuesday, a new U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia will pursue its interests in “competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways, including pressing to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad.’ ” In testimony on the Hill, William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former Ambassador to Russia, was pressed about Vladimir Putin’s intent. “He’s not going to stop at Ukraine, correct?” asked Representative Jackie Speier, of California. Burns replied, “That’s what makes it more important than ever to demonstrate that he’s not going to succeed in Ukraine.” The stakes, Burns acknowledged, are bigger. “This is one of those pivotal points where we and all of our allies and partners need to act.”

But How Much Has Changed?;"The order to shutter Al Mabani, a notorious jail set up in Libya to detain migrants bound for Europe, might be seen as progress. But it is also an indication of darker aspects of migrant detention.
In mid-January, without explanation, the Libyan government officially shut down Al Mabani, the country’s most notorious prison for the detention of migrants. The prison, which first opened in January of 2021, had previously held several thousand people under ghastly conditions in a set of makeshift warehouses in Tripoli, the capital of Libya.Al Mabani, which means “The Buildings” in Arabic, functioned as part of a shadow immigration system created by the European Union to stop migrants, many of them from sub-Saharan Africa, from reaching Europe’s shores. When the migrant crisis began, in the early twenty-tens, the dominant tone on the continent was one of compassion. Angela Merkel promised to welcome migrants, saying, “We can do this!” But as the crisis accelerated, and as nationalist parties began fanning xenophobic fears, Europe searched for ways to keep migrants out. One of its primary partners in this endeavor has been Libya, which, after the fall of its longtime leader Muammar Qaddafi, became a failed state, run by rival governments and powerful militias. The E.U. now equips and trains the Libyan Coast Guard, an assortment of patrols with links to militias, to patrol the Mediterranean Sea and intercept migrant rafts before they arrive in Europe. The migrants are then held in a network of Libyan prisons run by militias.
Migrants at Al Mabani and elsewhere have routinely faced sexual assault, deprivation of food and health care, savage beatings, and forced labor at construction sites, on farms, in private homes, and in military facilities. The trade in captive migrants is big business in Libya, and the militias that run the detention centers make money on detainees through extortion and ransom. At Al Mabani, migrants typically had to pay about five hundred dollars for their release. Human-rights abuses at Al Mabani reached a peak in October, when armed men rounded up and detained as many as five thousand migrants from a nearby slum. In the following days, guards fired on migrants attempting to escape, killing six and injuring two dozen more. Federico Soda, the head of the Libya mission for the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration, said at the time, “Some of our staff who witnessed this incident describe injured migrants in a pool of blood lying on the ground.”
In November, The New Yorker, in collaboration with the Outlaw Ocean Project, a nonprofit journalism organization where we work, published an investigation into abuses at Al Mabani. (On Monday, the investigation was recognized with a George Polk Award for International Reporting.) The piece told the story of Aliou Candé, a climate migrant from Guinea-Bissau, who was intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard in the Mediterranean Sea and sent to Al Mabani. He succeeded in getting a message out to his family on a phone that he managed to hold onto in prison: “We were trying to get to Italy by water. They caught us and brought us back. Now we are locked in prison.” Eventually, he was killed by guards, who fired into his cell during a fight between inmates.
For years, the E.U. has formally called for the closure of migrant prisons in Libya. (An E.U. spokesperson denied direct involvement in migrant detention in Libya, saying, “Our programs are intended to save lives, protect those in need, and fight trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling.”) But Jeff Crisp, who from 2006 to 2013 was the head of policy development and evaluation at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.), said that these claims have “arguably not been serious,” since the E.U. also supports “the whole system of interception and return” that causes migrants to be brought to the prisons. Last year, the Libyan Coast Guard picked up and returned to the country more than thirty-two thousand migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, up from nearly twelve thousand in 2020, according to the U.N.’s migration agency. In the days after our investigation, Najla Mangoush, the foreign minister of Libya’s Government of National Unity, said that years of European money sent to bolster her country’s migration-enforcement actions had primarily served the E.U.’s agenda. “Please do not push the problem in our lap, and please don’t point your fingers at Libya and portray us as a country which abuses and disrespects refugees,” Mangoush said, at a conference promoted by the Italian government in December.
After our investigation was published, there was a flurry of international attention on the state of migrant detention in Libya. On January 13th, the Libyan authorities ordered the closing of Al Mabani—a development we found out only several weeks later, through the U.N.H.C.R. The move to shutter Libya’s most notorious migrant prison might be taken as progress. However, it is also an indication of the lack of accountability in the ways that migrants are handled in Libya. Detention centers are opened, closed, and reopened from one week to the next, and the migrants are shuttled between them. In 2019, Tajoura, a particularly infamous detention center, was decommissioned, only for its staff to be moved to Al Mabani, where severe abuses continued. The ever-shifting nature of these prisons and their lack of proper record-keeping help to insulate the abuse from scrutiny: each time detainees are relocated or a center closes and another one opens, it becomes more difficult for aid groups to track the migrants and to insure that they are not being sold into forced labor or otherwise trafficked.
The order to close Al Mabani also underscores the patronage system that passes for governance in Libya. Detention centers and the trafficking of detainees offer money-making opportunities, and militias vie for access, which is granted based on political connections. Militias with allies in the national agency that oversees migration in Libya, the Directorate for Combatting Illegal Migration (D.C.I.M.), get more of these lucrative migrants sent to their facilities. A former director of the D.C.I.M., General Al-Mabrouk Abdel-Hafiz, was tied to the militia that ran Al Mabani. (We were not able to reach Abdel-Hafiz for comment.) As a result, much of the profitable flow of migrants went to his favored center. For reasons that remain unclear, Abdel-Hafiz was ousted from this job, in December. After the new director, Mohammed al-Khoja, took over the D.C.I.M., he did not move into its headquarters. According to an activist who runs a humanitarian group in Tripoli, al-Khoja instead manages the agency from Tariq al-Sikka, another prison in Tripoli that he ran. Most of the transferred detainees from Al Mabani seem to have wound up at Tariq al-Sikka, and at another detention center in the Libyan capital called Ain Zara. (The D.C.I.M. did not respond to requests for comment.)
Although Al Mabani has officially been closed, the humanitarian activist—who spoke on the condition of anonymity, out of concern for his safety—said that as many as fifty migrants are still being held at the site. “The local militia is using them in construction, maintenance, and for cleaning their military vehicles, and also for cleaning and maintaining their own homes and farms,” the activist said. Judith Sunderland, the associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that her organization is concerned about this. “Anyone left in Al Mabani is now detained in an unofficial detention site, where there is no chance of any outside help,” she said. “If official centers are hellholes, unofficial centers are black holes where it’s even easier for people to be abused, exploited and disappeared.”
Observers fear that the official closing of Al Mabani could also mark the beginning of a broader effort by the Libyan government to move detention centers outside of Tripoli. There is not yet evidence that other centers will be moved, but the motivations to do so are clear. “Escapes by detainees would presumably be more difficult when the prison is in the middle of nowhere,” Crisp said. “Pestering from aid groups and journalists is also less likely, since the government more tightly limits movement outside the capital city.” The humanitarian activist said that fewer migrants are being disembarked in Tripoli, and that his organization is extremely concerned about the safety of those who are held elsewhere. “Almost all the landings take place to the west of the city of Al-Zawiya,” he said. “The D.C.I.M. says it is holding eight thousand people, but inside Tripoli the number is small, we do not believe that it exceeds two thousand.”
In January, the Outlaw Ocean Project detailed its investigation before the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, outlining the E.U.’s role in filling Libya’s migrant-prison system. During the hearing, E.U. officials denied responsibility for abuses. “We are not funding the war against migrants,” Rosamaria Gili, the head of the Maghreb division at the European External Action Service, said. “We are trying to instill a culture of human rights.”
A week later, an E.U. official announced plans to provide five more vessels to the Libyan Coast Guard. More vessels mean more high-seas arrests—and more migrant detainees sent to prisons like Al Mabani or Tariq al-Sikka. Sunderland said, “What’s insane is that the European Union is propping up this monstrous business model by helping Libyan forces to intercept people at sea and take them back to these detention centers.”In mid-January, without explanation, the Libyan government officially shut down Al Mabani, the country’s most notorious prison for the detention of migrants. The prison, which first opened in January of 2021, had previously held several thousand people under ghastly conditions in a set of makeshift warehouses in Tripoli, the capital of Libya.

Judith Sunderland, the associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that her organization is concerned about this. “Anyone left in Al Mabani is now detained in an unofficial detention site, where there is no chance of any outside help,” she said. “If official centers are hellholes, unofficial centers are black holes where it’s even easier for people to be abused, exploited and disappeared.”
Observers fear that the official closing of Al Mabani could also mark the beginning of a broader effort by the Libyan government to move detention centers outside of Tripoli. There is not yet evidence that other centers will be moved, but the motivations to do so are clear. “Escapes by detainees would presumably be more difficult when the prison is in the middle of nowhere,” Crisp said. “Pestering from aid groups and journalists is also less likely, since the government more tightly limits movement outside the capital city.” The humanitarian activist said that fewer migrants are being disembarked in Tripoli, and that his organization is extremely concerned about the safety of those who are held elsewhere. “Almost all the landings take place to the west of the city of Al-Zawiya,” he said. “The D.C.I.M. says it is holding eight thousand people, but inside Tripoli the number is small, we do not believe that it exceeds two thousand.”
In January, the Outlaw Ocean Project detailed its investigation before the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, outlining the E.U.’s role in filling Libya’s migrant-prison system. During the hearing, E.U. officials denied responsibility for abuses. “We are not funding the war against migrants,” Rosamaria Gili, the head of the Maghreb division at the European External Action Service, said. “We are trying to instill a culture of human rights.”
A week later, an E.U. official announced plans to provide five more vessels to the Libyan Coast Guard. More vessels mean more high-seas arrests—and more migrant detainees sent to prisons like Al Mabani or Tariq al-Sikka. Sunderland said, “What’s insane is that the European Union is propping up this monstrous business model by helping Libyan forces to intercept people at sea and take them back to these detention centers.”"

Emmanuel Macron has been battling on all fronts to prevent an actual war. On Monday, the French President visited the Kremlin, where, speaking across an inordinately long white table, he tried to sell his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on the need for “de-escalation” at the Ukrainian border, where Moscow has recently positioned more than a hundred thousand troops. Speaking from Kyiv, the next day, Macron reassured the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, of France’s determination to “consolidate” his country’s sovereignty, just before flying to Berlin for a meeting with the new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the Polish President, Andrzej Duda. This frantic itinerary was just one element of Macron’s diplomatic and political agenda of late. In the past two weeks, he has had more than a dozen conversations with world leaders. Since mid-December, he has talked to Putin by phone five times—more than twice the number of calls between Moscow and Washington in the same period.Beyond the palpable sense of urgency, what Macron is trying to achieve looks more like a balancing act. On the one hand, with the French Presidential elections just two months away, he seems intent on establishing himself as Europe’s leader—a role previously held by Angela Merkel, the former German Chancellor. On the other, he is following the hard line adopted by the United States and its NATO partners, including the rejection of Russia’s demands that NATO limit its military activity in eastern Europe and that it bar Ukraine, a former Soviet territory, from ever entering the alliance, while remaining more open than the Biden Administration and some other European nations to considering Putin’s security concerns. The situation seemed to escalate on Friday, with the Times reporting that Russia and its separatist allies in eastern Ukraine are, according to Kyiv and Washington, ramping up military preparations. Can Macron’s frenetic mediation help resolve the crisis, or will it simply be what the French call un coup d’épée dans l’eau, or a sword stroke in the water—an action that produces no effect?
The French President has a history of trying to cultivate personal ties with autocratic figures. He did it with Donald Trump—initially, at least—in a number of bonding events that included a “double date” at Mt. Vernon, with the First Lady, Melania, and the Première Dame, Brigitte. “It’s always important for Macron, the personal side of relationships,” Tara Varma, the head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “He wants to open a new chapter of French foreign policy,” she said, one that includes rekindling relations with Moscow.
At first, Macron’s eagerness to engage directly with Russia caused some concern among France’s allies. Only two weeks after being sworn in, in May, 2017, he invited Putin to the Palace of Versailles, greeted the former K.G.B. officer on a red carpet, and held a joint news conference with him in the palace. While Macron did not shy away from discussing subjects such as the war in Syria and the role of Russian media in spreading disinformation, he insisted on maintaining an open dialogue with Moscow. Macron welcomed Putin again, in 2019, at the Fort of Brégançon, the Presidential summer retreat on the Mediterranean, where he acknowledged “this great power that is Russia” and offered to build, together, “a new security architecture for our Europe.” He doubled down a week later at a gathering of French Ambassadors. “Pushing Russia away from Europe is a profound strategic error, because we will push Russia either into an isolation that increases tensions or into alliances with other great powers such as China,” Macron said.
At the time, Macron’s policy troubled his European partners, who felt that he had not sufficiently taken into account their security concerns with Russia. “There are many countries in Europe for which Russia is an existential threat, and they must be involved in the decision-making process,” Varma said, referring to Poland and the Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—which fear becoming the next target of Putin’s expansionism. Along with Germany and the Netherlands, these countries were made uneasy by any initiative that could lead to the lifting of economic sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia after the invasion of Crimea. “There was a hint of complacency,” Varma said, pointing to Macron’s failure to coördinate with his European partners.
France has been a somewhat unruly ally to the U.S. since the Cold War, often trying to assert its independence on the world scene, as when Charles de Gaulle decided to pull out of NATO’s integrated military structure in the nineteen-sixties. Macron shocked his Western partners in 2019, when, in a blunt interview with The Economist, he declared that NATO was experiencing “brain death.” He later explained that he’d meant the comment as a “wake-up call” to prompt a reflection on the alliance’s strategic goals. But it came at a time when the relationship between Europe and Washington was already severely strained. Trump, accusing the E.U. of taking advantage of the U.S. in trade agreements, had imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the Continent, and threatened additional taxes on eleven billion dollars of European products. The Biden Administration brought a softening of tone—and a rollback of tariffs—but also a shift in the U.S. geopolitical focus to Asia, and to China in particular, which further rankled Europeans. Last October, Biden’s announcement that the U.S. and the U.K. would help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarines to counter China in the region led the Australian government to withdraw from a sixty-six-billion-dollar deal to buy French-built submarines, infuriating Paris. Biden soon patched things up with Macron, acknowledging that the U.S. had been “clumsy.”
Now NATO—and U.S. engagement in Europe—has been revitalized by the threat of a potentially full-scale war on the Continent. And Macron is striving to leverage his personal connection with Putin to prevent it. But he seems to have learned the lessons of 2019, taking care to conduct some preliminary consultative diplomacy. A French official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told me that Macron had the U.S.’s full support. “They tell us what they are doing, and we debrief them on what we do,” the official said. Muriel Domenach, the French Ambassador to NATO, retweeted a list of calls that Macron had with other heads of state in the lead-up to his Moscow visit. They included discussions with Biden, Zelensky, and Putin (several with each); the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson; and the leaders of the three Baltic states and a few other nations. This inclusive stance was on full display on Tuesday, in Berlin, when Macron debriefed Scholz and Duda on his visit to the Kremlin, resurrecting an old, informal compact, the so-called Weimar Triangle, which had been instituted after the Cold War to boost over-all coöperation between the three countries.
One of Macron’s proposals to solve the current crisis is to revive the “new security architecture” that he pitched to Putin in 2019. “These next few weeks should lead us to bring to fruition a European proposal to build a new order of security and stability,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, last month, after France assumed the rotating, six-month presidency of the E.U. But he was careful to add, “We must build it among Europeans, then share it with our allies within the NATO framework. And then offer it for negotiation to Russia.”
Exactly what this new order would look like and how it could prevent a war remains unclear. “It’s a bit ambiguous,” Anne de Tinguy, a senior researcher at the Center for International Studies at Sciences Po, in Paris, said. “This is part of his desire for strategic empowerment of Europe vis-à-vis the United States, and therefore vis-à-vis NATO,” she said, “but still in coöperation with NATO and the U.S.” A more concrete option, which France and Germany have been promoting in recent days, would repurpose a moribund peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, known as Minsk II, to de-escalate the crisis. Minsk II, which was negotiated in the Belarusian capital in 2015, was meant to resolve a conflict in the eastern Ukraine region of Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists had seized swaths of territory. It offered a path to reintegrate the separatist areas into Ukraine, while giving Russia some avenues to influence Ukrainian politics. But disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over such matters as the degree of autonomy granted to the Donbas rebels, and whether they would have the ability to block Ukraine from joining NATO, prevented Minsk II from being fully implemented. Still, Macron said on Tuesday, after speaking with Putin and Zelensky, that both leaders were open to pursuing this solution, calling it the “only path on which peace can be built.”
To that purpose, Macron and Scholz have been working to revive another European initiative, the Normandy Format, a diplomatic grouping that includes representatives from France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine, and which helped broker the Minsk II agreement. Created in 2014, at an informal meeting of the leaders of the four countries during the seventieth-anniversary commemoration of the D Day landings, in Normandy, the format has been largely inactive in recent years, but it met in Paris at the end of last month, and again in Berlin on Thursday. Because the format excludes the U.S., some experts believe that it has the merit of avoiding direct confrontation between Washington and Moscow. Others are skeptical. “The Minsk negotiations, until yesterday, until today, are completely blocked,” de Tinguy said, noting that the January meeting in Paris had been disappointing. “As far as we know, the representatives of the four countries mainly took stock of their disagreements.” (The Thursday meeting in Berlin also reportedly ended without major breakthroughs.) Still, according to the French official I spoke with, “the U.S. backs both the Minsk agreements and the Normandy Format.”
European dependence on Russian energy supplies further complicates things, as the Biden Administration seeks French and German support for threatening Moscow with hard economic sanctions. At the center of the problem is Nord Stream 2, the controversial eleven-billion-dollar natural-gas pipeline that connects Russia to Germany. Nord Stream 2 is not yet active, but Germany has been ambivalent about the prospect of shutting the project down. “It looks like the new ruling coalition has not taken a definite position on the matter,” de Tinguy said. That reluctance was evident following Scholz’s meeting with Biden at the White House this week. “If Russia invades, there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,” Biden told the press. Scholz, however, appeared less committal, saying, “We are absolutely united.”
If Macron’s capital-hopping tour and the personal relationship he has been trying to cultivate with Putin for nearly five years help prevent war in Europe, it will certainly bolster his case for reëlection in April (though he has yet to officially announce his candidacy). But, as Anne de Tinguy points out, “In the eyes of the Russians, the real interlocutors are the United States.” She added, of Macron, “In truth, he doesn’t have much leverage. But he sure has the will.”Emmanuel Macron has been battling on all fronts to prevent an actual war.

The Party’s prospects in the midterms do not look bright, and everyone involved in Democratic politics is exhorting the Party’s elected officials to do something about it.

To many, the Party’s fate hinges on the earthy personas of a few red-state survivors—Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Jon Tester in Montana—as if the only thing keeping the center left from a total wipeout is, as one Montana Democratic operative put it to me last week, in describing Tester, “a flat-topped, three-fingered dirt farmer.” Pick different candidates, Democrats tell their leaders, and say different things.

Last Wednesday, at about noon local time in Germany, the question of who the most powerful woman in the world is became harder to answer. Until then, the easy response was Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. But, that afternoon, Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democratic Party, was sworn in as Chancellor, and Merkel, of the Christian Democratic Union, who had held the job for a little more than sixteen years, began her life as a retired politician. She didn’t lose the last election, which was held in late September (it’s taken since then for Scholz, a former mayor of Hamburg, to form a governing coalition); she didn’t run at all. On Wednesday, she watched from the visitors’ gallery as members of the Bundestag, Germany’s federal parliament, cast their votes for Scholz. Afterward, during a brief exchange in which Merkel formally handed over occupancy of the chancellery offices to Scholz, she wished him good luck, and he gave her a bouquet of flowers. Merkel, the first woman to hold the office, is also the first postwar Chancellor to leave the office on her own terms, neither resigning under pressure nor leaving in defeat. That is a rare kind of power, too.Merkel wasn’t only a spectator in the transition; she used the occasion to deliver statements both symbolic and explicit. Last week, she was honored with a ceremony known as a Großer Zapfenstreich, a marching-band military salute and presentation of arms. It is held after dark and involves soldiers, in formation, carrying torches. Bettina Schausten, who was anchoring coverage of the ceremony for ZDF, a public-television broadcaster, noted that the Großer Zapfenstreich has its roots in the sixteenth century, when something like it was used as a sort of last call to tell soldiers to stop drinking and go to bed. It has been part of Germany’s postwar democratic tradition, used to honor departing Chancellors and ministers of defense. Still, Schausten observed, the torch aesthetics might have “odd” and “false associations” for some—Merkel’s ceremony was held in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which was used by the Wehrmacht during the Second World War and now houses both the Ministry of Defense and a memorial to the German resistance to the Nazis. “Sort of shows the burden of history, of course,” Schausten said.Last Wednesday, at about noon local time in Germany, the question of who the most powerful woman in the world is became harder to answer.

At the Vatican last Wednesday, the general audience—a weekly ritual in which the Pope speaks and leads prayers for several thousand pilgrims and dignitaries—was spontaneously taken over by a ten-year-old boy in a sweatsuit and running shoes. The child, named Paolo, clambered onto the stage in the Audience Hall, where Pope Francis was seated with a cleric on either side. Francis smiled at him as a scriptural text was read aloud. Paolo pointed to the zucchetto, the Pope’s white skullcap, and sat in a chair that one of the clerics vacated for him.

The episode, Francis later said, showed the kind of freedom commended in Scripture—the freedom to act “from the heart,” the way that children do.On Friday, Francis will greet a very different guest: President Joe Biden, who will be in Rome for a summit of leaders of the G-20 nations—a highly unspontaneous exercise in international diplomacy. The audience will be the first meeting of the two since Biden’s election as President (though they spent time together when Biden was Vice-President), and it will be scrutinized both for its substance and its symbolism. Already, traditionalist Catholics are leery that it will be seen as evidence that Francis is siding with Biden in the controversy stirred up by the large contingent of U.S. bishops who insist that, because the President supports legal abortion, he should be barred from receiving Communion at Mass. But the Pope is an anomaly —a religious leader who is also a head of state—and holding audiences with other world leaders is part of the job: Francis had an audience with President Trump in 2017. He will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of India (who is also en route to Glasgow) prior to the G-20 summit. And, as the encounter with Paolo showed, a meeting with the Pope is as much about aura as about doctrine or policy.At the Vatican last Wednesday, the general audience—a weekly ritual in which the Pope speaks and leads prayers for several thousand pilgrims and dignitaries—was spontaneously taken over by a ten-year-old boy in a sweatsuit and running shoes.

On Friday, Francis will greet a very different guest: President Joe Biden, who will be in Rome for a summit of leaders of the G-20 nations—a highly unspontaneous exercise in international diplomacy. The audience will be the first meeting of the two since Biden’s election as President (though they spent time together when Biden was Vice-President), and it will be scrutinized both for its substance and its symbolism. Already, traditionalist Catholics are leery that it will be seen as evidence that Francis is siding with Biden in the controversy stirred up by the large contingent of U.S. bishops who insist that, because the President supports legal abortion, he should be barred from receiving Communion at Mass. But the Pope is an anomaly —a religious leader who is also a head of state—and holding audiences with other world leaders is part of the job: Francis had an audience with President Trump in 2017. He will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of India (who is also en route to Glasgow) prior to the G-20 summit. And, as the encounter with Paolo showed, a meeting with the Pope is as much about aura as about doctrine or policy."

Elections, we are often reminded, have consequences, but those consequences can take time to unravel. Sometimes the result is a marathon of negotiations, which can go in many directions. In Washington, one consequence of the 2020 election is that Democratic control of the Senate can be lost with a single vote, and that of the House with the defection of a relatively small group. These narrow margins have led to a bewildering situation in which the country can simultaneously come close to a federal-government shutdown (because of a failure to fund the government) and to a default (because of a failure to raise the debt ceiling, a statutory limit that serves not as an instrument of financial prudence but of legislative blackmail). Those negotiations happen both within and between the parties, and in both cases they have taken on a tone that veers from fervent and idealistic to unyielding, bitter, cynical, meretricious, and absurd—sometimes at dizzying speed.It might, then, be instructive to look at another set of election-induced negotiations unfolding this week, some four thousand miles away. Last Sunday, Germany held its first election in almost a generation in which Angela Merkel did not lead her party, the Christian Democratic Union (which runs alongside its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, in federal elections). Merkel, who is sixty-seven, has been Chancellor since 2005. She is stepping down from politics, and the weight she has carried can be seen in the election’s results: no one really won. The C.D.U. had a historically bad result: it received 24.1 per cent of the votes. But the biggest vote-getter, the center-left Social Democratic Party, known by its German initials S.P.D., got only 25.7 per cent. The Green Party was third, with 14.8 per cent, and the Free Democratic Party (F.D.P.), which might be described as socially liberal and economically conservative, came fourth, with 11.5 per cent. Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party, came in at 10.3 per cent, while the Left, whose name is apt, got about five per cent; both had their strongest showings in the states that were once part of East Germany.Elections, we are often reminded, have consequences, but those consequences can take time to unravel.

Joe Biden has waited a lifetime for this trip. As his White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, joked, before Biden departed on his first European tour as President—which will culminate in a face-to-face staredown with Vladimir Putin next Wednesday, in Geneva—“he’s been getting ready for fifty years.” The buildup suggested nothing less than an epochal event, but there is often a mismatch between the grand language of international summitry and the accomplishments that actually result. That is likely to be the case with Biden’s inaugural foray, as well. His national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that the purpose of the trip was nothing less than “to rally the world’s democracies to tackle the great challenges of our time.” Biden himself, soon after landing in Britain, his first stop on the three-country, eight-day trip, said something similar. “The United States is back, and the democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges,” he told U.S. troops stationed in England. “I believe we’re at an inflection point in world history.”Joe Biden has waited a lifetime for this trip.

So much for lowering expectations. Before the trip, Biden’s advisers said that the summits would focus on the “three ‘C’s”: COVID, climate, and China. Sure enough, one of the first initiatives they rolled out was a plan to purchase five hundred million COVID vaccines from Pfizer and distribute them internationally. Supporters immediately hailed this as a “vaccine Marshall Plan.” On Thursday, Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the host of the G-7 meeting, signed an expansively worded update of the famous Atlantic Charter, which was first executed by F.D.R. and Winston Churchill during the Second World War. This one vows to “commit to continue building an inclusive, fair, climate-friendly, sustainable, rules-based global economy for the 21st century,” among other lofty aspirations. The forthcoming communiqué for the NATO summit next week, meanwhile, was said to focus extensively on how the transatlantic alliance could begin to reorient itself toward the security challenges posed by a more assertive China, which has been the primary foreign-policy goal articulated by Biden. The message from the new Administration is simple: Europe should unite with the United States in order to counter the increasingly global threat from authoritarian nations both near (Russia) and far (China).This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

He soon became a German folk hero.

He grew up in a working-class family in West Berlin, in the nineteen-fifties, and spent his childhood tinkering with chemistry kits and sending gunpowder rockets whizzing into the sky. In school, he was mischievous. Because of his sense of humor, a kindergarten teacher called him “Micky Maus.” He left school at fifteen to become an apprentice sign-maker, spent time sketching, and tried his hand at caricatures of politicians and celebrities. “I was born with a talent for drawing,” he told me.

https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-there-is-so-much-confusion-about-the-astrazeneca-vaccine;2021-03-23;Why There Is So Much Confusion About the AstraZeneca Vaccine;"A lack of transparency seems to have caused unnecessary doubts—and damaged the effort to build public trust in vaccines.
Why is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which was approved for use in the United Kingdom in December and in the European Union in January, not yet available in the United States? Every answer to that question leads to another query. It isn’t available because the Food and Drug Administration hasn’t given it an emergency-use approval, as it has for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Why not? Because AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company that partnered with Oxford University researchers in developing the vaccine, hasn’t applied for F.D.A. approval. And why hasn’t it? Until this week, the answer was that the vaccine’s U.S. clinical trials had not been completed. But, on Monday, AstraZeneca put out a press release with what it said were key interim results of the trial, which included more than thirty thousand participants, and the data looked excellent. The vaccine appeared to be seventy-nine-per-cent effective at preventing “symptomatic COVID-19.” The press release said that no one in the trial who was given the vaccine became severely ill, was hospitalized, or died as a result of COVID-19, and that the study did not turn up any serious safety concerns.The stage seemed to be set for an emergency-use approval by May, after an F.D.A. review of the raw data and a hearing by its vaccine-advisory committee. Then, in the early hours of Tuesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—the part of the National Institutes of Health that Anthony Fauci runs—put out an extraordinary and troubling statement. It said that the independent board monitoring AstraZeneca’s clinical trial had “expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.” In a response issued several hours later, AstraZeneca acknowledged that the “cut-off” for the numbers in its release had been February 17th; the company said that the data it had gathered since then seemed to be “consistent,” but that it would work to get them integrated and planned to have revised results “within 48 hours”—raising the question of why it didn’t just wait two days and get it right.Why is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which was approved for use in the United Kingdom in December and in the European Union in January, not yet available in the United States?

The pandemic has been both a bad and an embarrassing time to be an American. Bad in an actuarial sense, because per-capita death rates here have been among the highest in the world. Embarrassing at the level of national identity. In Washington, last year, the President promised that the virus would be gone by Easter, and when it wasn’t he mused that Americans might self-treat with bleach. In Michigan, armed men guarded a barbershop that had defied public-health orders to close. On South Padre Island, in Texas, spring break proceeded as usual—packed and unmasked—even as cases were climbing. The state’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, insisted that there were “more important things than living”; later, he urged Texans to keep the economy open even if it meant more deaths. In cities everywhere, the virus followed the furrows of racism and inequity; Black and Hispanic people suffered the most from the disease and women from the economic aftermath. Churches sought exceptions from bans on gatherings that applied to everyone else. The news unfolded with the juxtaposed clarity of a historical montage: the death counts were mounting, even as resistance to public-health measures defined the political debate. The rich retreated to second homes and the beach. Even in dying, we couldn’t manage collective action. It seemed so finally, depressingly American—a mistrustful, poorly led, decentralized, and historically libertarian country that couldn’t even put on a cloth mask without making a national political fight about it.And yet, for all the crowdsourced, up-to-the-minute dashboards of deaths and hospitalizations and vaccinations, the elegant, colored curves showing the arc of the disease in Lombardy or Louisiana, it’s been surprisingly tricky for epidemiologists to pinpoint exactly where these American idiosyncrasies mattered. Some of the obvious candidates don’t pan out. Donald Trump refused to wear a mask, but so, for a time, did Angela Merkel. Despite the surreal intensity of the anti-lockdown protests, cell-phone data show that Americans really did stick close to home when they were asked to, and even our adherence to masking was as good as or better than in comparable countries. The United States is rolling out vaccines faster than any other country, except for Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. As deeply rooted as the resistance to vaccination can seem here, it is worse elsewhere—in France, sixty per cent say they might refuse. The pressure on hospitals in the U.S. has been easing, and new case counts are in slow decline. But take the American experience of the past year, marked as it was by cycles of sickness, death, resentment, and shame, and compare it with others around the world, and an entirely different story emerges.The pandemic has been both a bad and an embarrassing time to be an American.

On a morning in May, 2019, forty-three lawyers, academics, and media experts gathered in the windowless basement of the NoMad New York hotel for a private meeting. The room was laid out a bit like a technologist’s wedding, with a nametag and an iPad at each seat, and large succulents as centerpieces. There were also party favors: Facebook-branded notebooks and pens. The company had convened the group to discuss the Oversight Board, a sort of private Supreme Court that it was creating to help govern speech on its platforms. The participants had all signed nondisclosure agreements. I sneaked in late and settled near the front. “Clap if you can hear me,” the moderator, a woman dressed in a black jumpsuit, said.Since its founding, in 2004, Facebook had modelled itself as a haven of free expression on the Internet. But in the past few years, as conspiracy theories, hate speech, and disinformation have spread on the platform, critics have come to worry that the company poses a danger to democracy. Facebook promised to change that with the Oversight Board: it would assemble a council of sage advisers—the group eventually included humanitarian activists, a former Prime Minister, and a Nobel laureate—who would hear appeals over what kind of speech should be allowed on the site. Its decisions would be binding, overruling even those of Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder. Zuckerberg said he had come to believe that a C.E.O. shouldn’t have complete control over the limits of our political discourse. “Maybe there are some calls that just aren’t good for the company to make by itself,” he told me.On a morning in May, 2019, forty-three lawyers, academics, and media experts gathered in the windowless basement of the NoMad New York hotel for a private meeting.

Eight days into his tenure, President Joe Biden has not occupied my every waking thought—nor, I suspect, yours. He has not insulted anyone, as far as I’m aware. He has not played golf instead of working, or held late-night counselling sessions with cable-television anchors, or caused a rupture in our relationship with Australia. He had a friendly call with Angela Merkel, and a stern one with Vladimir Putin. He went to church on Sunday, and stopped for bagels in Georgetown. His tweets have been sparse and so anodyne that a writer for the Washington Post compared them to the sayings that come inside fortune cookies. He has returned policy wonks and message discipline to the White House.

In some ways, Biden has already fulfilled his first, and arguably most compelling, campaign promise: being the un-Trump. Just three weeks ago, the former President was seeking to overturn the results of the Electoral College and exhorting a white-supremacist mob that later stormed the Capitol. Biden’s scandals so far—buying a Peloton bike, wearing an expensive Rolex watch—look to be more of the Obama-wore-a-tan-suit variety. Shrinking the Presidency back into its pre-Trump size in our collective consciousness may be the easiest part.This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

He has not played golf instead of working, or held late-night counselling sessions with cable-television anchors, or caused a rupture in our relationship with Australia. He had a friendly call with Angela Merkel, and a stern one with Vladimir Putin. He went to church on Sunday, and stopped for bagels in Georgetown. His tweets have been sparse and so anodyne that a writer for the Washington Post compared them to the sayings that come inside fortune cookies. He has returned policy wonks and message discipline to the White House. Technocrats are in; Rudy Giuliani is out.
In some ways, Biden has already fulfilled his first, and arguably most compelling, campaign promise: being the un-Trump. Just three weeks ago, the former President was seeking to overturn the results of the Electoral College and exhorting a white-supremacist mob that later stormed the Capitol. Biden’s scandals so far—buying a Peloton bike, wearing an expensive Rolex watch—look to be more of the Obama-wore-a-tan-suit variety. Shrinking the Presidency back into its pre-Trump size in our collective consciousness may be the easiest part."

It is hard to overstate the scale of the pandemic in America. On many days, a quarter of a million Americans become newly infected with the coronavirus, and four thousand die—numbers that dwarf the deadliest moments of last spring. The country’s COVID-19 death toll has passed four hundred thousand and, according to Joe Biden’s chief of staff, will reach half a million in February; at any given time, more than a hundred thousand Americans are hospitalized with COVID-19, and health systems are running out of space, equipment, and personnel. Meanwhile, a new coronavirus variant, thought to be fifty per cent more transmissible and possibly thirty per cent more deadly than the original, has been discovered in at least nine states. The U.S. has no genome-sequencing or reporting system in place, so it’s impossible to say just how widespread the new variant is, or whether other, more dangerous strains are already in circulation. In any event, the sheer contagiousness of the new version means that the death toll is almost certain to rise further and faster.Vaccines are a reason for hope, and are already making a difference; nearly twenty million Americans have received a shot. But vaccine distribution has also proceeded chaotically and haphazardly. The problem isn’t strictly one of supply. Doses are being shipped as quickly as they can be manufactured, but only about half of the shots received by states have actually been administered. Meanwhile, four in ten people say that, even if vaccines were more widely available, they would hesitate to get innoculated, because they distrust the government and the approval process. Sixty per cent of older Americans—many of whom are now eligible for vaccination—say they don’t know where or when to get immunized.It is hard to overstate the scale of the pandemic in America.

Kirtiraj Rana grew up in Rajamunda, a village of fewer than a thousand people in the northeastern Indian state of Odisha, which faces the Bay of Bengal. A migrant worker, he dropped out of school when he was in tenth grade to help support his family—his parents, a brother who also dropped out, and a sister who received only a fifth-grade education. Odisha’s farming revolves around its brief rainy season. Unable to find work in the off months, Rana travelled with his brother to Mumbai in December of 2019. They were hired as construction workers.

We were very scared.” A few days later, Narendra Modi, the Indian Prime Minister, announced one of the world’s largest and strictest lockdowns. Modi delivered his speech at 8 P.M. on March 24th; restrictions started at midnight. Millions of migrant workers were stranded without wages, food, or shelter. All forms of public transportation—by air, rail, and road—were suspended. Police arrested, and sometimes beat, people who remained out for nonessential activities.

Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has spent more than half of her short political career in exile. Six months ago, the former English teacher was a stay-at-home mom. Her husband, the businessman Siarhei Tsikhanouski, often used his popular YouTube channel to criticize the regime of the dictator Alexander Lukashenka, who has ruled Belarus for twenty-six years. In May, as Belarus prepared for the quinquennial ritual that Lukashenka calls a Presidential election, Tsikhanouski, who had planned to run, was arrested. So was another opposition candidate, Viktar Babaryka. A third, Valery Tsepkalo, was not allowed on the ballot. Three women—Tsepkalo’s wife, Veronika; Babaryka’s campaign director, Maria Kalesnikava; and Tsikhanouskaya—joined forces and put Tsikhanouskaya forward as the opposition candidate for President. She was allowed on the ballot, apparently because Lukashenka didn’t take her seriously. On Election Day, August 9th, she appeared to get a majority of the vote. Lukashenka claimed victory, however. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets in protest and have continued protesting since. Every weekend for the last eighteen weeks, people have marched in the streets of Minsk, the Belarusian capital, and other cities and towns. Lukashenka’s forces have cracked down brutally, jailing upward of a thousand protesters some weekends, but the demonstrations continue.The day after the election, Tsikhanouskaya entered the building of the central election commission in Minsk; the following day, she posted a video in which she said that she had been forced to leave the country. Since then, she has been based in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. (The two women who aided her are in exile and jail. Veronika Tsepkalo left Belarus just before the election. Kalesnikava was arrested after she refused to leave the country.) The United States and the European Union have not recognized Lukashenka’s claim to have won the election, and Tsikhanouskaya has become her country’s representative to the world.

For four years, Donald Trump has been asking us to believe the unbelievable, to accept the unthinkable, to replace harsh realities with simple fantasies. On Thursday night, using the White House as a gaudy backdrop, the President made his case to the American people for four more years. His speech capping the Republican National Convention was long, acerbic, untruthful, and surprisingly muted in comparison to the grandeur of the setting, which no chief executive before him has dared to appropriate in such a partisan way. “We will make America greater than ever before,” he promised.For four years, Donald Trump has been asking us to believe the unbelievable, to accept the unthinkable, to replace harsh realities with simple fantasies.

On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is widely known in Washington to have his own Presidential ambitions, broke with long-standing diplomatic tradition and delivered a glowing speech about Donald Trump’s “bold initiatives” in “nearly every corner of the world.” Speaking from the rooftop of a Jerusalem hotel, while on a taxpayer-funded trip through the Middle East, Pompeo praised the President for exposing China’s “predatory aggression,” getting North Korea to the negotiating table, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and the recent diplomatic opening between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Yet what was most striking  about the surprisingly stiff and skimpy speech was how much Trump hasn’t done in four years—and even that at a cost. He’s devastated America’s reputation globally. He’s done little to confront dictators or counter competing powers. And his policies on the defining issues of our time are too often empty, even illusory. In 2020, America is a shell of the nation it once was on the global stage.As Trump seeks reëlection, some of the toughest criticism on his foreign policy is from other Republicans, including a scathing joint condemnation last week by seventy-five senior Republican officials from four Administrations. “Without question, Trump has denigrated our standing with friends and with foes. They all think less of us,” Richard Armitage, one of the signatories, and the Deputy Secretary of State during the George W. Bush Administration and Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan Administration, told me. “Our standing globally has not been this low since the end of the Cold War and probably not since before World War Two. . . .  People don’t really care about us. They’re so over us because of this guy.”On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is widely known in Washington to have his own Presidential ambitions, broke with long-standing diplomatic tradition and delivered a glowing speech about Donald Trump’s “bold initiatives” in “nearly every corner of the world.” Speaking from the rooftop of a Jerusalem hotel, while on a taxpayer-funded trip through the Middle East, Pompeo praised the President for exposing China’s “predatory aggression,” getting North Korea to the negotiating table, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and the recent diplomatic opening between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

On a bright morning in May, Isabel Klugherz, a medical student at Ludwig-Maximilians University, in Munich, arrived at the geographical center of the city’s Milbertshofen district. Over the previous month, as Munich’s streets emptied under lockdown orders, an exception had been granted for roving medical students in mint-green scrubs and face masks. The university’s department for infectious diseases was screening for the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2—antibody testing—by sending police-escorted teams on the winding pattern of a predetermined algorithm, otherwise known as a random walk. Start in the center of an electoral district, continue past a few houses, cross to the other side of the street, select the third house, and knock. In the past month, Klugherz had knocked on nearly a thousand doors, and residents had been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about participating; one man had pronounced it more important than his Sunday celebration of the Holy Mass. That morning, the algorithm led Klugherz into a quiet road of whitewashed modernist buildings. The day before, she had texted a friend who lived nearby to let him know that she would be in the area. Now, unexpectedly, the algorithm led her to his door. She rang the bell. When her friend answered, and found Klugherz standing outside, he was still in his pajamas.In late March, the government of the state of Bavaria, which includes Munich, was trying to decide how to respond to what appeared to be an accelerating community spread of COVID-19. Michael Hoelscher, the director of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at L.M.U., was involved in official debates about whether to impose a citywide lockdown. That, to him, was a foregone conclusion. Considering the disease’s rate of transmission, under the most extreme scenarios, it could take about two and a half years to reach herd immunity in Germany. “Not an option,” Hoelscher said. What was less clear was how the city could effectively track the disease’s spread. Because so many cases of COVID-19 appeared asymptomatic, as Hoelscher had first noted in a paper published in January, diagnostic testing alone would only provide a partial measurement. “So I said, ‘O.K., we need something,’ he told me. The only way to get an accurate measurement of the epidemic, he reasoned, was to implement wide-scale antibody testing. Within six hours, just before the lockdown was announced, on March 21st, he received a million euros from the government.On a bright morning in May, Isabel Klugherz, a medical student at Ludwig-Maximilians University, in Munich, arrived at the geographical center of the city’s Milbertshofen district.

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled, on Thursday morning, against Donald Trump’s effort to stop a Manhattan prosecutor from obtaining his tax returns, the President lamented how unjust the decision was. “Courts in the past have given ‘broad deference,’ ” he tweeted. “BUT NOT ME!” He elaborated: “This is all a political prosecution,” he said. “Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!” POTUS is, as ever, a whiny loser.Soon after the Supreme Court ruled, on Thursday morning, against Donald Trump’s effort to stop a Manhattan prosecutor from obtaining his tax returns, the President lamented how unjust the decision was. “Courts in the past have given ‘broad deference,’ ” he tweeted. “BUT NOT ME!” He elaborated: “This is all a political prosecution,” he said. “Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!” POTUS is, as ever, a whiny loser.
His whinging, though, should not obscure the fact that Trump, yet again, has escaped to fight another day. In a 7–2 ruling, the Justices, including two Trump appointees, reaffirmed the principle that no one, not even the President, is above the law. But the decision allowed Trump to continue fighting in lower courts over the terms under which he must comply, a ruling that makes it all but certain that he will not have to turn over his tax returns before this fall’s Presidential election. He may lament “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,” but Trump seems to have once more managed to avoid having to produce information about his sketchy finances before facing voters. Losing just might be a form of winning after all. Sure enough, that was exactly what Trump’s advisers took to claiming. “This was a win for the President,” the Administration’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, declared from the White House lectern. Asked about Trump’s angry tweets, McEnany simply dismissed them as “general” comments. “It is a big win,” she added, before also saying, confusingly, that the President agreed with the dissenters in the case. “I would underscore the victory here.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

On Tuesday morning, a day after Donald Trump crossed Lafayette Square for an awkward photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, I met an outraged Lutheran pastor there—he was in a cassock, parking his bike. Only a few hours earlier, on Monday evening, heavily armed federal troops had beaten with batons and fired smoke grenades and chemical irritants at a stunned crowd of peaceful protesters, to make way for the President. Now it was a lovely June morning, and the square was quiet, punctuated only by the sound of TV reporters’ live standups and the distant hum of buzz saws, as carpenters installed plywood boards on the front of nearby office buildings.On Tuesday morning, a day after Donald Trump crossed Lafayette Square for an awkward photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, I met an outraged Lutheran pastor there—he was in a cassock, parking his bike.

The pastor, Michael Wilker, is one of the leaders of the Washington Interfaith Network, and he had been summoned from St. John’s sister parish, a Lutheran church on Capitol Hill. His bishop had already denounced Trump’s Monday-night actions as “a desecration of the church.” Wilker told me that he considered them not only an “abomination” but an effort by the President to distract from the point of the protests that have followed the murder of George Floyd: police brutality and racial injustice. As a Lutheran, Wilker said, he felt especially upset by Trump’s clumsy wielding of the Bible as he stood in front of St. John’s, a scene that was soon turned into a campaign-ad-style montage by the White House. “During Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler used the symbols of the Lutheran church—our own church—as a way to divide Christians from one another, and especially to deny the humanity of Jews in Germany. It’s the same thing Trump is doing here: he is using the symbols of the church,” Wilker said, “as a way to divide the church from one another and to divert our attention from the actual suffering and killing that’s going on.” It was, he concluded, “a demonic act.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a knack for stripping politics to their basics. While many leaders have been ill prepared for the crisis, and made errors of judgment about how best to protect their populations, a handful of leaders have shown an admirable degree of statesmanship: Jacinda Ardern, in New Zealand; Sanna Marin, in Finland; and Angela Merkel, in Germany, come to mind.

While many leaders have been ill prepared for the crisis, and made errors of judgment about how best to protect their populations, a handful of leaders have shown an admirable degree of statesmanship: Jacinda Ardern, in New Zealand; Sanna Marin, in Finland; and Angela Merkel, in Germany, come to mind.

The conventional wisdom is that a woman could never ascend to the leadership of North Korea, a country stuck in a time warp of passé fashions, hairdos, music, and social mores. A toxic mix of Confucianism and totalitarianism indentures women to their husbands, to their in-laws, and, ultimately, to a male-dominated regime. With a few exceptions (the best known being the vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui), North Korea’s senior cadres are almost entirely male. The Supreme People’s Assembly—which currently has six hundred and eighty-seven members—is supposed to set aside twenty per cent of its seats for women, but the percentage has frequently dipped lower. And the primary function of these token deputies seems to be to brighten the optics, by wearing the jewel-toned, floor-length Korean gowns best known by the South Korean term hanbok. Since 1948, North Korea has been ruled by three men—the founder, his son, and his grandson—but, nevertheless, it is now conceivable that the fourth man will be a woman. That is because, with reports that Kim Jong Un is in failing health, the most obvious successor is his thirtysomething sister, Kim Yo Jong.Kim Jong Un was a conspicuous no-show at ceremonies marking his grandfather’s birthday, on April 15th—the most important holiday on the North Korean calendar and an event that he has never missed since becoming leader, in 2011. A series of missile tests scheduled to coincide with the holiday went off without the customary footage of Kim watching from a viewing stand or peering through binoculars. North Korea’s official news agency, KCNA, continues to report on his purported activities (such as greetings and birthday messages sent to allies), but no reliable photographs of him have emerged since April 11th.The conventional wisdom is that a woman could never ascend to the leadership of North Korea, a country stuck in a time warp of passé fashions, hairdos, music, and social mores.

Late last year, Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture released a succinct new take on the country’s national narrative, via YouTube: a five-minute animated music video unpithily titled “The History of Ukraine—Complete and Uncompromising, Unadorned and Pop.” With rap from the venerable Ukrainian hip-hop group TNMK, lyrics by the activist poet Artem Polezhaka, and nostalgic hand-drawn animation by Sashko Danylenko, the video is post-Soviet “Schoolhouse Rock!” for digital natives. Released in the heat of the U.S. Presidential impeachment hearings, it’s also a reminder that there’s more to Ukraine than phone calls from Donald Trump. Viewers should keep in mind, however, that every national story has a political slant.In this case, the politics are a holdover from Ukraine’s previous administration, led by President Petro Poroshenko, who was elected after the 2013–14 Maidan protests, in Kyiv. One of Poroshenko’s priorities was to counter Russia’s propaganda war: tactics included suppression of media deemed anti-Ukrainian, new requirements for the use of the Ukrainian language in the media, and assorted projects intended to foster patriotism. The music video was funded by the Ministry of Information Policy, a department hastily established in 2014 and instantly denounced as an Orwellian “Ministry of Truth” by Ukrainian journalists concerned about threats to freedom of speech. (Under Ukraine’s new President, Volodymyr Zelensky, it has been subsumed into the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport.) The video is also part of a more personal political project: Polezhaka told me that he wrote his lyrics as part of the ongoing series “That’s How Memory Works”—songs dedicated to the memory of a teen-ager killed during the 2015 bombing of a pro-Ukrainian march in the eastern city of Kharkiv.Late last year, Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture released a succinct new take on the country’s national narrative, via YouTube: a five-minute animated music video unpithily titled “The History of Ukraine—Complete and Uncompromising, Unadorned and Pop.” With rap from the venerable Ukrainian hip-hop group TNMK, lyrics by the activist poet Artem Polezhaka, and nostalgic hand-drawn animation by Sashko Danylenko, the video is post-Soviet “Schoolhouse Rock!” for digital natives.

In a Park Hyatt hotel ballroom in midtown Manhattan, on Wednesday, Greta Thunberg, the sixteen-year-old climate activist, stood before world leaders and delivered a goosebump-inducing speech. The occasion was the release of “The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate,” a major scientific report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that human activities have made the oceans increasingly inhospitable to marine life and have caused glacial melt and sea-level rise to happen at an even faster rate than scientists had previously projected. The effects—already well under way, with some locked in over the next century—pose an immediate threat to the survival of certain island nations and high-alpine communities, as well as hundreds of millions of other coastal inhabitants and many of the world’s fisheries. “The reason we have taken to the streets is because of science,” Thunberg said, after thanking the U.N. scientists who authored the report. “This is about an existential crisis for the biosphere and for humanity.” On the projection screen behind her was a seal stranded on a tiny iceberg in a big blue ocean. “Our main enemy now is physics. We can still fix this, it is still possible, but not if we continue like now.” She concluded, “We must listen to the scientists.”The report, which is based on nearly seven thousand peer-reviewed studies, was prepared and written by a hundred and four scientists from thirty-six countries. It was the latest addition in a dire trilogy of I.P.C.C. special reports, which previously included studies on the extreme risks of even 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming and on the impacts of climate change on land. (Additionally, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, a U.N.-backed body, released a report in May on the accelerating rate of widespread extinction across species.) Wednesday’s report took a similarly comprehensive approach to studying climate change’s impact on ice formations, sea level, and the planet’s oceans.In a Park Hyatt hotel ballroom in midtown Manhattan, on Wednesday, Greta Thunberg, the sixteen-year-old climate activist, stood before world leaders and delivered a goosebump-inducing speech.

“Oomph,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, earlier this week, is what he plans to bring to negotiations with the European Union as the deadline for Brexit approaches. But, given the state of play, that term is less likely to evoke the decisive force of Johnson’s diplomacy than the sound an overstuffed sack of flour makes when it’s dropped from a great height and bursts. As things stand, the United Kingdom is due to crash out of the European Union without essential rules in place—on trade, travel, data sharing, and, crucially, the rights of millions of European citizens living in the U.K., and vice versa—on October 31st. These areas and more were covered in a withdrawal agreement that Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, negotiated with the E.U., but Parliament rejected that deal three times. Almost everything Johnson has done this week has made a potential no-deal Brexit more likely and more damaging. On Wednesday, at a joint press conference with Johnson in Berlin, Angela Merkel—“Chancellor Angela,” as he called her—effectively told him that he had thirty days to stop being ridiculous. It won’t be enough time.This round of trouble was set off on Monday, when Johnson sent a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, insisting that everything would work out if the E.U. simply agreed to ditch one of the central components of the withdrawal agreement, known as the backstop, which relates to the Irish border. This is a long-standing issue, and Johnson’s airy declaration that the backstop was unfair, undemocratic, and simply had to go, with unspecified “alternative arrangements” to be figured out at some point, was seen in Europe not only as impractical but infuriating. (France’s President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Johnson in Paris on Thursday, called the backstop “indispensable.”) It didn’t help that, the same day, Johnson’s government made a garbled announcement about the end of the free movement of people in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which raised more questions for E.U. citizens in the U.K. than it answered. In both cases, the message was to trust Boris: he’d figure it out, or muddle through, or at least be the amusing author of a disaster.“Oomph,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, earlier this week, is what he plans to bring to negotiations with the European Union as the deadline for Brexit approaches.

For the past two and a half years of Donald Trump’s Presidency, I have consoled myself with the argument that, despite all the chaos and narcissism and racial incitement and norm-shattering, the American system of government is holding itself together. When Trump attempted to introduce a ban on Muslims entering the country and sought to add a citizenship question to the census, the courts restrained him. When he railed at NATO and loyal allies like Germany’s Angela Merkel, other members of his Administration issued quiet reassurances that it was just bluster. When the American people had the chance to issue a verdict on Trump’s first two years in office, they turned the House of Representatives over to the opposition party.All of this was reassuring. But, while watching what happened on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, testified before two House committees, I struggled to contain a rising sense of dread about where the country is heading. With Republicans united behind the President, Democrats uncertain about how to proceed, and Mueller reluctant to the last to come straight out and say that the President committed impeachable offenses, it looks like Trump’s blitzkrieg tactics of demonizing anyone who challenges him, terrorizing potential dissidents on his own side, and relentlessly spouting propaganda over social media may have worked. If so, he will have recorded a historic victory over the bedrock American principles of congressional oversight and equality before the law.For the past two and a half years of Donald Trump’s Presidency, I have consoled myself with the argument that, despite all the chaos and narcissism and racial incitement and norm-shattering, the American system of government is holding itself together.

One of Trump’s great skills has been to confound his opponents. In the third year of his Presidency, this is as true as it was on his first day in office, and his critics, at home and abroad, have, in the intervening time, become more skilled at reading Trump but hardly less capable or united in agreeing what to do about him. They have received the message that he is a threat to the established order—just about any established order—but resistance has often been more loud than effective, and the divisions over how to take him on seem to widen by the day. He is historically unpopular for a President by many measures, but no matter what he does the allegiance of some forty per cent of the American public has so far remained unwavering.This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Many people were understandably relieved by the results of last weekend’s European elections, which saw the rise of the far right somewhat contained, at least for now. In Britain, France, Hungary, and Italy, nationalist parties that have embraced Euroskepticism did well. But, in Austria, Germany, and Spain, they won a smaller share of the vote than they did in the most recent national elections, and in Denmark and the Netherlands they suffered big setbacks. When the new Parliament gathers, an assortment of xenophobic right-wing parties will control about a quarter of the seats, making them a potent force but not a dominant one.Among the winners of the election were two pro-European groups: the Greens, who took about nine per cent of the vote over all, and the centrist liberal-democrat bloc, which was strengthened by the presence of Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance alliance. An optimistic reading of the outcome is that, with the Greens on the rise and the centrists emboldened, the new Parliament will be able to provide the leadership that Europe so desperately needs after a decade of political crises and economic stagnation. On Tuesday, Macron, whose alliance gained 22.4 per cent of the French vote—one percentage point less than the far-right National Rally, which was formerly known as the National Front—outlined an agenda for European renewal, which includes addressing climate change, creating more jobs, and strengthening the E.U.’s economic institutions.Many people were understandably relieved by the results of last weekend’s European elections, which saw the rise of the far right somewhat contained, at least for now.

Since the global financial crisis, European politics have fragmented and swerved alarmingly to the right, as voters across the continent have elected nationalists and given far-right parties their largest vote shares of the postwar era. When, in late May, the European Parliament held its first election since 2014, many feared that far-right parties would increase their vote totals; indeed, the far right will see its representation increase by about a fourth, to twenty-five per cent. But that wave was smaller than expected, and left-wing, pro-Europe parties—particularly Green parties—gained significant ground, largely at the expense of the center left. (Center-right parties, predictably, took a hit from the far-right surge.)Still, European politics remains extremely fragile. In Italy, the coalition government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the neo-Fascist Northern League has taken harsh anti-immigrant lines, and Matteo Salvini’s Northern League won a plurality in the recent European vote. In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (which recently changed its name from the National Front)  was the top vote-getter, coming in slightly ahead of President Emmanuel Macron’s new centrist party, En Marche! In Britain, where the Prime Minister, Theresa May, has announced that she will step down, in early June, Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party took a clear plurality of votes, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour lost ground to both the passionately pro-Remain Liberal Democrats and the Green Party.Since the global financial crisis, European politics have fragmented and swerved alarmingly to the right, as voters across the continent have elected nationalists and given far-right parties their largest vote shares of the postwar era.

“Good morning,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said to a room of bleary-eyed reporters in Brussels on Thursday, at a little after 2 A.M. He and the twenty-eight leaders of the European Union’s member states had been meeting since the previous afternoon to try to figure out what to do about Brexit. Theresa May, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister, was invited to only some of those meetings. There was no space in the schedule to sleep and reconvene, because the U.K., which had failed to ratify a withdrawal agreement that May had negotiated or to come up with an alternative, was due to crash out of the E.U. on Friday night. Such a No Deal Brexit would have been bad for almost everyone, and yet seemed a possible product of the sheer weariness and frustration surrounding the Brexit negotiations—or of the clock simply running out. In the press conference, Tusk announced that the No Deal disaster had, at least, been averted: the U.K., which had already received one extension, would get another. Now it has until October 31st to decide what it wants, with some conditions attached. And Tusk also delivered what he called “a message to my British friends.” It was this: “Please, do not waste this time.”For anyone who has watched Parliament in the past few months, it’s hard to imagine the British political establishment doing anything but waste time. The Brexit referendum was held almost three years ago, in June of 2016. And it was in March of 2017 that the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the E.U.’s basic treaty, to notify other members that it was leaving. That provision gave it two full years to negotiate a withdrawal agreement, or divorce—which, if May had not sought the first extension, would have expired on March 29th. This time, she asked the E.U. for a short extension, to June 30th, but no one really believed that the U.K. could get the deal done by then. And so, although May desperately needed an extension, getting a different date than she’d asked for could also be seen as a defeat—yet another personal rejection. In her own early-hours press conference, she faced a series of questions from the British press that seemed premised on the idea that she had just been humiliated: Could she “in good conscience” still serve as the leader of the Conservative Party? Hadn’t she once suggested that she’d resign if there was a long extension? Where was the promised Brexit? And: “Don’t you feel you owe the country an apology?” May, visibly exhausted, her voice jittery, replied that “if sufficient members of Parliament had voted with me in January”—the first of three times that M.P.s turned down her deal—“we would already be out.” When she made the same point, back in London, in an appearance before Parliament, on Thursday afternoon, some members jeered.“Good morning,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said to a room of bleary-eyed reporters in Brussels on Thursday, at a little after 2 A.M. He and the twenty-eight leaders of the European Union’s member states had been meeting since the previous afternoon to try to figure out what to do about Brexit. Theresa May, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister, was invited to only some of those meetings. There was no space in the schedule to sleep and reconvene, because the U.K., which had failed to ratify a withdrawal agreement that May had negotiated or to come up with an alternative, was due to crash out of the E.U. on Friday night. Such a No Deal Brexit would have been bad for almost everyone, and yet seemed a possible product of the sheer weariness and frustration surrounding the Brexit negotiations—or of the clock simply running out. In the press conference, Tusk announced that the No Deal disaster had, at least, been averted: the U.K., which had already received one extension, would get another. Now it has until October 31st to decide what it wants, with some conditions attached. And Tusk also delivered what he called “a message to my British friends.” It was this: “Please, do not waste this time.”
For anyone who has watched Parliament in the past few months, it’s hard to imagine the British political establishment doing anything but waste time. The Brexit referendum was held almost three years ago, in June of 2016. And it was in March of 2017 that the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the E.U.’s basic treaty, to notify other members that it was leaving. That provision gave it two full years to negotiate a withdrawal agreement, or divorce—which, if May had not sought the first extension, would have expired on March 29th. This time, she asked the E.U. for a short extension, to June 30th, but no one really believed that the U.K. could get the deal done by then. And so, although May desperately needed an extension, getting a different date than she’d asked for could also be seen as a defeat—yet another personal rejection. In her own early-hours press conference, she faced a series of questions from the British press that seemed premised on the idea that she had just been humiliated: Could she “in good conscience” still serve as the leader of the Conservative Party? Hadn’t she once suggested that she’d resign if there was a long extension? Where was the promised Brexit? And: “Don’t you feel you owe the country an apology?” May, visibly exhausted, her voice jittery, replied that “if sufficient members of Parliament had voted with me in January”—the first of three times that M.P.s turned down her deal—“we would already be out.” When she made the same point, back in London, in an appearance before Parliament, on Thursday afternoon, some members jeered."

There is something poignant about the image of Prime Minister Theresa May, of the United Kingdom, being greeted by Chancellor Angela Merkel, of Germany, on Tuesday, in Berlin. The deadline for the United Kingdom to crash out of the European Union in a No Deal Brexit—that is, without basic rules or the shock absorber of a transition period in place—is currently Friday, April 12th, at 11 P.M., three days away. In London, officials in May’s government are engaged in tense and somewhat desperate talks with the Labour Party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to come up with a compromise that could allow the withdrawal agreement that May negotiated with the E.U.—the only deal available—to make it through Parliament. (It’s been rejected three times.) But May is using one of those days to meet with Merkel and, in the afternoon, to fly to Paris, to see President Emmanuel Macron. She needs to: the U.K. is out of time and needs an extension, which would be its second. That can only be granted unanimously, by all the other twenty-seven members of the E.U., whose leaders will meet in Brussels, on Wednesday, to consider whether they should do so—or whether they should just let the U.K. go over what is, after all, a cliff of its own making, and move on with its own business. Merkel is seen as tending toward the first option, which is why May is likely asking for her help. Macron has openly advocated the second, which is why May needs to ask for his restraint.At every stage of Brexit, it has been hard to tell what the U.K. actually wants, and that is true of the length and terms of another extension, too. On Friday, May wrote a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, asking for an extension until June 30th—a date that the E.U. had specifically advised her not to ask for, and had rejected when she nevertheless did ask for it a first time, in March. Instead, it gave her until April 12th, or, if Parliament approved her deal, until May 22nd. All the mooted dates have to do with elections for the European Parliament, which are being held from May 23rd to the 26th. April 12th was the deadline for the British government to call those elections, which May did on Monday, over loud objections from some in her own party, who were angry at the very idea of affirming the U.K.’s connection to an institution it is trying to leave. May’s government pointed out that, if the U.K. is still legally a member of the E.U. on the date of the elections, but the polls are not open, British citizens could sue the government for denying them their voting rights. The E.U. is also concerned that the legitimacy of the European Parliament as a whole would be put into question. For one thing, June 30th is just before the newly elected European Parliament would convene, and, if the U.K. is no longer going to be a member, its seats are supposed to be redistributed to other countries. Parties in those countries would like to know how many candidates to run.There is something poignant about the image of Prime Minister Theresa May, of the United Kingdom, being greeted by Chancellor Angela Merkel, of Germany, on Tuesday, in Berlin.

On Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Theresa May rose in the House of Commons to make a point of order. “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,” she said. Parliament had just, for the third time, rejected the withdrawal agreement, or “divorce deal,” that she had negotiated with the European Union to manage Brexit, by a vote of 346–288, and the situation, she said, was “grave.” As a result of the vote, the U.K. is on track to leave the E.U. on April 12th (the date had originally been March 29th) with no deal at all—that is, with no new arrangements on trade or travel and with deep insecurity for British citizens residing in E.U. countries, Europeans in the U.K., and businesses. Chaos at the borders remains the default. But, as May suggested, the situation may be even graver than that. Parliament does appear to be approaching some sort of limit. If the M.P.s can’t figure a way out—and time is very short—Brexit could bring the British political order down with it.Some of the actions that May took this week, in her desperate attempts to get the deal approved, have increased the potential for upheaval. On Wednesday, she promised members of her Conservative Party that, if they would only vote yes on her deal, she would resign before the next stage of Brexit negotiations. That won some Tory votes, but it mostly served to turn attention to the many striving Tories who may want to replace her, including some, notably Boris Johnson, who are widely loathed. (May’s promise did help to get Johnson and his colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had both previously decried her deal as a form of slavery, to vote for it. Dominic Raab, who was May’s Brexit secretary but quit because he said that he found the deal unbearable, also voted for it. He, too, is a likely contender for her job.) Indeed, the net effect may have been to cost her Labour votes, since voting for the deal also meant voting for uncertainty about which unlikely character  might be leading the operation next. When May appeared before the House, shortly before the vote, Wes Streeting, a Labour M.P., said, “I’ve got to say sincerely to her, she may have sacrificed her career to put the country first, but there are plenty of people who aim to follow her who always put themselves first, above the country.” Only five Labour M.P.s voted for the deal.On Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Theresa May rose in the House of Commons to make a point of order. “I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,” she said.

“Are we ever going to leave the E.U., Prime Minister?” a reporter from the Daily Mail asked Theresa May at a press conference in Brussels, on Thursday night, which was held hours later than expected. May, who looked weary, assured him that Brexit was still on—even though Britons don’t seem to like the options for making it happen, her own Conservative Party has turned on her, and, by the time she spoke, nearly two million people had signed a petition to call it off. (By Friday afternoon, it was more than three million.) Only the timetable had changed. When May arrived in Brussels earlier that day, for meetings with the leaders of the twenty-seven countries remaining in the E.U., the U.K. was on course to crash out on March 29th, after Parliament had twice rejected the deal that she had negotiated with the E.U. to manage that exit, and it hadn’t agreed on an alternative. The E.U. countries had to unanimously agree to any extension, and key leaders, notably Emmanuel Macron, of France, were sounding unsympathetic; they wanted the agony of negotiating Brexit to end. A chaotic, off-the-cliff, No Deal Brexit had hardly ever looked more likely. But now there is a new date, or, rather, two: May 22nd, if Parliament approves the deal next week, to allow all of the necessary paperwork and supporting legislation to be dealt with, and April 12th, a new cliff edge, if it does not.This is not what May asked for, but she was lucky to get it. With these dates, Europe is telling the U.K. two things: it must, finally, almost three years after the referendum that put Brexit in motion, make a decision. And it must, for once, do so in a way that takes the E.U. and its institutions and aspirations seriously. What determined the new schedule was not Parliament’s needs but the timing of the European parliamentary elections, which are to be held between May 23rd and 26th. British politicians have tended to treat the question of whether the U.K. should take part in those elections, if Brexit isn’t quite complete, as a nuisance or a technicality. For Europeans, it is a matter of the possible disenfranchisement of E.U. citizens (both in the U.K. and in countries that are supposed to be allocated more seats post-Brexit) and the undermining of the legitimacy of the European Parliament and any decisions it sanctions. That legitimacy matters a great deal to them, even if the British see the European Parliament as one of the silly, overstuffed institutions they hate. There were indications that, if the U.K. had been willing to hold the elections, the E.U. would have been sympathetic to a request for a long extension, involving a plan to thoroughly rethink Brexit. Before May arrived in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, had, as his spokesman put it, “formally warned” her not to ask for an extension beyond May 22nd otherwise. She asked for June 30th, with no elections. Her theory was that, since the European Parliament wouldn’t be formally seated until July 2nd, it could all be muddled through.

In 2015, Anna Wintour presented Karl Lagerfeld with an Outstanding Achievement honor at the British Fashion Awards. “I have often thought that in my next life, I would like to come back as Choupette, his extremely beautiful and bourgeois cat,” Wintour said, in her congratulatory speech. She noted that the pet, which Lagerfeld adopted as a kitten, in 2011, has “two maids, a chef, a personal hairdresser, and many diamond necklaces.” She did not mention that Choupette has also boasted a modelling contract with Shu Uemura (the Japanese beauty brand’s Shupette line featured blushes, eyelash curlers, and a faux-fur makeup clutch), a partnership with the German stuffed-animal company Steiff (a limited-edition plush Choupette originally cost four hundred and ninety-nine euros), and an Instagram feed with more than two hundred thousand followers, as well as her own Web site, Choupette’s Diary. In the wake of Lagerfeld’s death, on Tuesday, at the age of eighty-five, the site published a eulogy for the designer written in the cat’s voice: “He was a true icon who touched the lives of everyone he came in contact with, especially moi.”In recent years, Lagerfeld almost never went anywhere without Choupette. (Much of the cat’s Instagram feed features her sleeping on private planes.) In an interview, he described the two of them as “really like an old couple,” noting that, as he had sprouted a white whiskery beard, they had also started to look alike. Even before he owned a cat, Lagerfeld had a feline temperament. He was preening, mercurial, a creature of luxurious comforts and particular tastes. He hissed at the things he did not like, including selfies, the Internet, short men, the #MeToo movement, the nineties, the telephone, sweatpants, any beverage that is not chilled, any beverage that is not Diet Coke. He had a tendency to bare his claws, telling one interviewer, for instance, that he considered sending a cactus to the funeral of Pierre Bergé, the longtime business (and sometimes romantic) partner of Yves Saint Laurent, one of Lagerfeld’s longtime creative and sartorial foils. However, his close friend André Leon Talley, of Vogue, wrote in a tribute to the designer that Lagerfeld could also be very warm when it came to his inner circle. “Karl was extravagant, generous, and very, very kind to his friends,” he wrote. “His kindness manifested itself in various ways, from loans of his 18th-century furniture to gifts of Fabergé diamonds, which he gave me for Christmas in 1989, the year my grandmother died.”In 2015, Anna Wintour presented Karl Lagerfeld with an Outstanding Achievement honor at the British Fashion Awards. “I have often thought that in my next life, I would like to come back as Choupette, his extremely beautiful and bourgeois cat,” Wintour said, in her congratulatory speech.

On the morning of December 19th, the editors of Der Spiegel called a staff meeting in the lobby of its headquarters, in Hamburg. The magazine’s offices occupy an immense but elegant building, with rows of windows tinged by the emerald color of the city’s waterways. An inscription on the wall near the entrance offers an imploring quote from the magazine’s founder, Rudolf Augstein: “Sagen, was ist”—Say what is. At the meeting, the editors told the staff that Claas Relotius, one of the publication’s star reporters, had invented characters, conversations, and other details in many of the dozens of stories he published in the magazine in the past seven years. The weekly production of a magazine is intensively collaborative and necessarily collective. The reputation of Der Spiegel, perhaps the most prestigious magazine in Europe, rests in no small part on the esteem of its fact-checking department, which employs at least sixty people full time. Many of the staff members at the meeting, one Spiegel reporter told me later, were close to tears. “We were all shocked and sad,” the reporter said. “It went to the core of how we understood our work. How could one single person be so harmful to all that we have been working on and pride ourselves on?”A month earlier, Relotius had e-mailed Juan Moreno, a freelancer he was working with on a story about immigration at the U.S. border. Relotius complained that Moreno’s sections of the piece, which followed a twenty-five-year-old Honduran woman travelling to the U.S. with her daughter, sounded like a “bad movie.” Relotius’s contributions, on the other hand, were the stuff of Tarantino; he’d embedded with a group of vigilante patrollers from Arizona, who went by the aliases Pain, Luger, and Ghost, and who waited for migrants on the American side of the border, outfitted with bulletproof vests and night-vision devices. Moreno, for his part, thought that Relotius’s sections were “too shiny,” and noticed that certain facts seemed off-kilter. For instance, one of the men was unemployed and presumably uninsured, but his daughter had spent months in a rehab facility; the men said that they’d handcuffed people in the mountains of Brownsville, but that part of Texas is flatlands. Relotius was a young reporter, and Moreno suspected that the militiamen might have played him. When the story was in layout and ready to go to print, the two journalists spoke on the phone. Moreno told Relotius that he’d read a similar story about border militias in Mother Jones, and some of the information in the two articles didn’t match up. Relotius assured him that only one of the people he’d met in Arizona had also appeared in the other article. “Then I knew, O.K., we’re in trouble, because he’s lying to me,” Moreno told me recently.

Memories, and eulogies, can be tricky things. That is true whether the reminiscence is personal or historical. For example, on Wednesday, Brian Mulroney, the former Prime Minister of Canada, stood before a congregation of mourners at the National Cathedral and told a story about President George H. W. Bush, whose flag-draped coffin rested nearby. The setting for the anecdote was a NATO summit, at which the heads of state of the member countries spoke. Mulroney had been pleased to observe that the President of the United States was diligently taking notes on his words. He saw that Bush continued with his jotting as President François Mitterrand, of France, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, of the United Kingdom, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of Germany, spoke. Then, Mulroney said, “It was the turn of the Prime Minister of Iceland, who, as President Bush continued to write, went on and on and on and on, ending only when the Secretary-General of NATO firmly decreed a coffee break.” The punchline was that “George put down his pen, walked over to me, and said, ‘Brian, I have just learned the fundamental principle of international affairs.’ ‘What’s that?’ I asked. Bush replied, ‘The smaller the country, the longer the speech.’ ”People laughed, perhaps because of how well the story matched the tone of other remembrances of Bush’s manner: diligent; impatient with anyone who got puffed up; down to earth, even about politics; and possessing a keen consciousness of America’s place in the world. That last quality, though, also might give one pause. To begin with, the punchline seems a little churlish toward Iceland, and to small countries generally. The President of the United States can have the stage anytime he likes, and the Prime Minister of Canada will almost always feel flattered that the U.S. President is taking notes while he speaks. What are NATO summits for if not to give smaller countries their moment, too? The image of the Old Guard amused by those whom it sees as the little people—the properly quiet or deferential—thinking that they have a big voice, is not the most appealing testament to Bush’s record of diplomacy, nor to the establishment that he has often been said, in recent days, to represent. But, before laying all of that at Bush’s door, it’s worth asking another, critical question about memory: Is the story entirely accurate?Memories, and eulogies, can be tricky things. That is true whether the reminiscence is personal or historical. For example, on Wednesday, Brian Mulroney, the former Prime Minister of Canada, stood before a congregation of mourners at the National Cathedral and told a story about President George H. W. Bush, whose flag-draped coffin rested nearby. The setting for the anecdote was a NATO summit, at which the heads of state of the member countries spoke. Mulroney had been pleased to observe that the President of the United States was diligently taking notes on his words. He saw that Bush continued with his jotting as President François Mitterrand, of France, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, of the United Kingdom, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of Germany, spoke. Then, Mulroney said, “It was the turn of the Prime Minister of Iceland, who, as President Bush continued to write, went on and on and on and on, ending only when the Secretary-General of NATO firmly decreed a coffee break.” The punchline was that “George put down his pen, walked over to me, and said, ‘Brian, I have just learned the fundamental principle of international affairs.’ ‘What’s that?’ I asked. Bush replied, ‘The smaller the country, the longer the speech.’ ”

The news media always misinterpreted George H. W. Bush. During the 1988 Presidential campaign, many commentators mistook his preppy appearance and goofy manner for weakness. Newsweek ran a cover story called “Fighting the Wimp Factor.” Even people inside Bush’s campaign took this perception seriously. I covered the campaign, and I remember watching Bush prepare for a televised debate and witnessing the late Roger Ailes tell him to stop waving his hands around, because it made him look like “a pansy.”This was someone who, during the Second World War, enlisted in the U.S. Navy and trained as a pilot. Flying in a torpedo bomber from the decks of an aircraft carrier, he flew fifty-eight combat missions over the Pacific, and during one of them he was shot down. For his service, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. To label him a wimp was ridiculous.The news media always misinterpreted George H. W. Bush.

In unrelenting rain, more than sixty world leaders—Presidents and Prime Ministers, kings and princes, from a third of all the nations on Earth—shared big black umbrellas as they marched together down the Champs-Élysées, in Paris, on Sunday. They gathered to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Armistice that ended the fighting of the First World War, and to express global unity. Donald Trump was not among them. He drove to the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in the dry comfort of his limousine. Aides cited security. The only apparent threat was from an unarmed topless activist, with the words “Fake Peacemaker” emblazoned across her chest, who tried to run near his motorcade.The President did the same thing the previous day, calling off a trip to honor the more than two thousand Americans buried in the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, some fifty miles outside of  Paris. (All told, fifty thousand Americans died in the First World War.) The White House cited foul weather. The response was fast and furious on the President’s favorite medium. Nicholas Soames, the grandson of the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a Conservative Party member of the British Parliament, tweeted, “They died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn’t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen.” He added the hashtag “#hesnotfittorepresenthisgreatcountry.” Michael Beschloss, the Presidential historian, tweeted a picture of President John F. Kennedy and the French President Charles de Gaulle getting soaked (without umbrellas) in Paris when they honored the war dead, in 1961. There were numerous jibes on Twitter, including one from @votevets, about whether the decision had something to do with Trump’s hair. The same day, despite the rain, the leaders of France and Germany managed to visit Compiègne—also fifty miles from Paris—where the Armistice was signed in a railway car a century ago.In unrelenting rain, more than sixty world leaders—Presidents and Prime Ministers, kings and princes, from a third of all the nations on Earth—shared big black umbrellas as they marched together down the Champs-Élysées, in Paris, on Sunday.

Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, as she took the stage at a press conference in Berlin, needs to write “a new chapter”; the one with her name on it is done, or almost so. She will not leave tomorrow, or even next year, if she has anything to do with it. Merkel will step down as the leader of her party, the Christian Democratic Union, in early December, at its next conference, in Hamburg. She would like to stay on as Chancellor until 2021, which is when she would have had to run for reëlection, though she may be pushed out sooner. In any event, she said, “This fourth term as Chancellor is my last.” (She added, “just for the record,” that she would not seek any other office, either.) Whether she can stay on depends, as much as anything, on whether anyone in her party, or in any German party, can really measure up to her and make a convincing leadership claim before then. She has served as the center for thirteen years.On Sunday, the C.D.U. won just twenty-seven per cent of the vote in elections in the federal state of Hesse (which includes Frankfurt), a drop of eleven per cent since the state’s last election, in 2013. That followed similarly grim results for the C.D.U.’s sister party, the Christian Social Union (C.S.U.), in Bavarian state elections two weeks ago—thirty-seven per cent, down ten. What is especially unsettling is that the C.D.U. was, in both cases, still the biggest vote-getter, or rather the biggest remaining fragment in a riven political field. The Social Democratic Party, the traditional left-of-center party, has lost its way; it didn’t quite manage to get twenty per cent in Hesse (down ten per cent), ending up in a virtual tie with the Green Party (which was up by almost nine). Thankfully, both were a few points ahead of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (A.F.D.), but for how long? The A.F.D. got more than thirteen per cent of the vote, tripling its previous share, and will enter the regional legislature for the first time.Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, as she took the stage at a press conference in Berlin, needs to write “a new chapter”; the one with her name on it is done, or almost so.

In his book “The American Mind,” from 1950, which I took down from the bookshelf during the weekend, the historian Henry Steele Commager notes that “the American” of the late nineteenth century had “little time for tradition and authority,” because “he knew that his country had become great by flouting both.” Simultaneously, however, the American “thought his government and the Constitution the best in the world, credited them with a large measure of the success of his experiment, and would not tolerate any attack upon their integrity.” Although some of Commager’s language, such as the use of “he,” grates on the modern ear, the paradox that he identifies survives to this moment, and it is doing untold harm to this country. The horrible events of the past few days have confirmed that the United States, while it remains a great nation, is a country trapped by its past. Despite a rising tide of gun violence and political extremism, it has repeatedly failed to adapt its institutions and its laws—particularly those relating to guns and the online spread of hate speech—to an age of technology-enabled savagery. Now the very foundations of the political system that so many Americans take for granted seem to be under threat.Is that a bit alarmist? On the basis of what we know, Robert Bowers, the forty-six-year-old loner who carried out a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, and Cesar Sayoc, Jr., the former male stripper from Florida who has been charged with sending mail bombs to opponents of President Donald Trump, are both alienated people who have lived small lives filled with resentments and failures. Nonetheless, the larger threat that their acts of terror represent shouldn’t be understated. When opposition politicians cannot open their mail without fear of being blown up, when people of religion cannot attend their houses of worship without fear of being shot to death, and when the President cannot forswear partisan attacks for more than a few hours after a deadly act of terror, then liberal democracy is malfunctioning in tragic fashion. As Americans, and particularly Jewish Americans, watched the news this weekend, they could be forgiven for believing that the horrors other countries have endured at other times were now upon them.In his book “The American Mind,” from 1950, which I took down from the bookshelf during the weekend, the historian Henry Steele Commager notes that “the American” of the late nineteenth century had “little time for tradition and authority,” because “he knew that his country had become great by flouting both.” Simultaneously, however, the American “thought his government and the Constitution the best in the world, credited them with a large measure of the success of his experiment, and would not tolerate any attack upon their integrity.” Although some of Commager’s language, such as the use of “he,” grates on the modern ear, the paradox that he identifies survives to this moment, and it is doing untold harm to this country.

For decades, American historians have viewed the summit between
President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in 1961,
as the worst ever between Washington and Moscow. Kennedy described the
encounter, in Vienna, as one of the low points of his life; his weakness
led Khrushchev to test the United States by deploying nuclear-armed
missiles in Cuba. That disastrous bit of summitry has now been topped by
President Trump’s meeting on Monday with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and his
public renunciation of U.S. intelligence reports and a recent Justice
Department indictment of Russian officials for meddling in the 2016
election. Senator John McCain called Trump’s remarks “one of the most disgraceful performances in memory” by a U.S. President. John Brennan,
the former C.I.A. director, said Trump’s deference to Putin was “nothing
short of treasonous.” In a tweet, he charged that Trump’s comments were
“imbecilic” and that they indicate the President is “wholly in the pocket of
Putin.” His action “rises to & exceeds the threshold of ‘high crimes &
misdemeanors.’ ” Brennan added, “Republican Patriots: Where are you???”Despite the Justice Department’s indictment, on Friday, of twelve Russian intelligence agents, for interfering in the 2016 election, Trump
fully embraced Putin’s bare-faced denial. “He just said it’s not
Russia,” Trump said at a joint press conference, after the meeting. “I
will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” He even
heralded—as an “incredible offer”—Putin’s suggestion that the special
counsel, Robert Mueller, come to Moscow to question the twelve agents, with
Russian officials present, in exchange for Russia being allowed to
interrogate any U.S. intelligence officials it believes have been
involved in covert operations against Russia.For decades, American historians have viewed the summit between

He really fluxed it up. The boosting began even before he arrived, with a ringing announcement that the United Kingdom was “in somewhat turmoil.” The President had already surprised many observers by informing us that Germany was now “totally controlled by Russia,” a phrase that will have left Vladimir Putin, for one, in somewhat heaven.Then there is Brexit. This is a topic, to be fair, that few people can talk about, on either side of the argument, without risking a burst blood vessel or a cognitive collapse. The subject of Britain’s withdrawal from Europe—which could range from soft to hard, like pornography—was broached by the President in an interview with the Sun newspaper, during which he took abrasive issue with the British Prime Minister’s approach. “I would have done it much differently,” the President said, sounding like a tourist who has given his phrase book a passing glance, but no more. “I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn’t agree.” Odd, that. I’m sure he would have listened politely if, for example, she had offered her thoughts on the need for political balance on the Supreme Court.One of the glories of the English language is its flux, with some words rising to prominence while others sink, and one of the glories of Donald Trump’s visit to Great Britain this week was the boost that he gave to that unceasing process.

Donald Trump unleashed his fury at America’s closest allies even before the NATO summit—assembling leaders from twenty-nine countries on both sides of the Atlantic—began on Wednesday. By the time the tumultuous two-day summit was over, the future of the world’s most powerful military alliance seemed uncertain. So, too, did the global order of the twenty-first century, given the dizzying array of disagreements that have erupted in the West over the past eighteen months on security, trade, nuclear proliferation, immigration, climate change, and regional relations. The tensions between the United States and its NATO partners were all the more worrisome after the G-7 summit—of the world’s most powerful economic alliances—in Quebec last month. Trump left early, withdrew U.S. agreement from a joint communique on goals, and insulted the host, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, on Twitter.Trump’s attitude toward traditional alliances of any ilk now seems ambivalent at best. He is usually demanding, often angry, and increasingly even dismissive—all with consequences that scare decades-old allies. “Trump at NATO Summit: It’s not just bad, it’s catastrophic,” a headline in Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung declared on Wednesday.Donald Trump unleashed his fury at America’s closest allies even before the NATO summit—assembling leaders from twenty-nine countries on both sides of the Atlantic—began on Wednesday.

Jose, a five-year-old Honduran boy, was taken away from his father by immigration officials last month, after the two of them had crossed the border at El Paso. The father was transferred to a detention camp. Jose, all alone, was put on a plane to Michigan and placed under the care of a family of kind but anguished strangers. In his bedroom at night, he clings to pictures that he’s drawn of his family—his mother and siblings in Honduras, with its epidemic of gang violence, and his father in a U.S. prison. He won’t stop asking, “When will I see my papa?”Jose’s torment—the increasingly routine consequence of the Trump Administration’s immigration policy to separate children from parents who enter the United States without papers—reminded me of a conversation I heard a few years ago, between Henry Kissinger and Ruth K. Westheimer. We were guests at a dinner in New York for Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, whom I had profiled.

Donald Trump hasn’t changed. The many biases and misconceptions that he has about the United States and its place in the world go back as far as 1990, when an interviewer from Playboy asked him about the first thing he would do if he were elected President. “Many things,” Trump replied. “A toughness of attitude would prevail. I’d throw a tax on every Mercedes-Benz rolling into this country and on all Japanese products, and we’d have wonderful allies again.” A President Trump, he went on, “wouldn’t trust our allies; he’d have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it.

Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un—the leaders of two countries that have technically been at war for the past seventy years—will make history, on Tuesday, just by shaking hands. They will meet at a luxury island resort, in Singapore, where peacocks strut the tropical grounds that were a pirates’ haven in the nineteenth century and a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in the twentieth. Two days have been allocated for the summit, although Trump said, on Saturday, that he would know “within the first minute” if a deal is doable with the North Korean leader. “If I think it won’t happen I’m not going to waste my time,” Trump said at a press conference at the G-7 summit, in Canada. “I don’t want to waste his time.”Within just five days, Trump is navigating two tough summits that may define his legacy, and even redefine the world order. The first summit—the G-7, with America’s six closest economic allies—didn’t end so well. The talks, in Quebec, were prickly at best. Tensions were captured in rival photos. In one, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, her hands planted on a table, loomed over a seated Trump, who glared back at her with his arms folded against his chest. It was tweeted by the summit’s German spokesman. Shortly thereafter, the White House released more than a dozen photos from the summit, including one showing the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, and Japan smiling as they huddled to listen to the American President.Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un—the leaders of two countries that have technically been at war for the past seventy years—will make history, on Tuesday, just by shaking hands.

Trudeau’s team was searching for strategies to salvage the annual G-7 summit with the American President, Donald Trump, and leaders of five of the world’s other large democratic economies—all of them close allies of the United States, and all of them furious with Trump. “Look, he personally decided he wanted to be fighting with everybody,” the Trudeau aide told me, referring to Trump. “Maybe he thinks it’s in his best interests to be combative and fighting.”For close to a year and a half, Trudeau and his counterparts have employed various strategies to try to head off conflict with the volatile American President, from flattery to stonewalling to hours of schmoozing on the golf course. But in recent weeks Trump has confounded their efforts, unleashing a tit-for-tat trade war with allies, blowing up the Iran nuclear deal over European objections, and walking away from a deal with Canada and Mexico to overhaul NAFTA, all while lavishing praise on the North Korean dictator with whom he hopes to reach an accord next week. Adding insult to injury, Trump even cited an obscure national-security provision to justify the tariffs, as if America’s closest friends had suddenly become its biggest enemies. As a result, the G-7 meeting that Trudeau will host on Friday and Saturday was shaping up to be the most contentious, and possibly the most consequential, since the summits began, in 1975.The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was less than forty-eight hours away from hosting the biggest diplomatic gathering of his career when I spoke with one of his top advisers on Wednesday afternoon.

There’s a lot that’s very funny about “Hard Knock Wife,” the recently released Neflix standup special by Ali Wong. Wong, who rose to comedy stardom with her first Netflix special, “Baby Cobra,” two years ago, has earned a reputation for claiming for women the right to raunch: to speak without shame of sexual desire, and to speak without flinching of bodily functions, and to straddle—wearing a skintight minidress, inner thighs exposed—the two.When she filmed “Baby Cobra,” Wong was seven months pregnant with her first child, and her routine included jokes about the baby’s conception—twerking was involved—and her already burgeoning resentment of being expected to contribute to the housework. (“No! I’m busy making an eyeball, O.K.?”) In “Hard Knock Wife,” Wong’s subject matter, like her family makeup, has evolved and shifted. Much of the hour-long special is devoted to itemizing the ravages that pregnancy and childbirth take on the female body and psyche, in ways that are intended to provoke discomfort and recognition. Wong takes a staple of male standup comedy—the dick joke—and turns it into an extended peroration on the transformation that childbirth can wreak upon a woman’s labia.

re-imposing economic sanctions on Iran and, over time, on companies in

it would have to cover several issues beyond Iran’s controversial
nuclear program—including Tehran’s ballistic-missile program, its
support for extremist groups, and other “malign” activities in the wider
Middle East. In a rebuke to Trump, however, the leaders of Britain,
France, and Germany expressed “regret” over Trump’s decision and vowed to
remain in the pact, which also includes Russia and China. “We urge all
sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a

Then Ross called the British Trade Minister, Liam Fox, with a reprieve: Trump had finally decided that there would be another month-long extension. The word came less than two hours before the White House publicly released the news. It was already approaching midnight in Europe.

Evidently, this was a concession to the trade doves inside the Administration—including Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, and Larry Kudlow, the new head of the National Economic Council—who want more time for negotiations with other countries to play out. But there is no assurance that more time will yield any breakthroughs—in part because the Administration’s policy was incoherent to begin with, and isn’t much clearer now.Does Donald Trump want a trade war?

And you can mark it down.” He called the historic accord, finalized in 2015, between Iran and the world’s six major powers, “insane. It’s ridiculous.

The Iran nuclear deal—the most significant non-proliferation agreement in more than a quarter century, whether you like the terms or not—is perched on the edge of a diplomatic cliff. By May 12th, President Trump will decide whether to kick it into the abyss. He hates it. “The worst deal I’ve ever seen,” he told Fox News, in an interview for the 2017 Super Bowl. “It was a deal that should never have been negotiated.” The world’s five other major powers—Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia—were equal parties to the accord. The United Nations Security Council unanimously endorsed it, as did the twenty-eight nations of the European Union. But the United States was the decisive voice during the two years of diplomacy that went into the deal’s signing, in 2015, and it will be decisive in its fate now.Trump could kill the deal by deciding not to comply with U.S. obligations—namely, the waiving of sanctions, which was promised in exchange for Iran limiting its controversial nuclear program. The President could also walk away from the deal altogether, even though the five other powers are still wedded to it. His Administration apparently calculates that Iran will stick to the terms, whatever Washington does. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told me otherwise. “If they want to kill the deal, they have that option, but they have to face the consequences,” Zarif said. “It’s dangerous to be arrogant, very dangerous.” For fifteen months, he added, Trump has already tried to sabotage the accord by disrupting normal business with Iran.The Iran nuclear deal—the most significant non-proliferation agreement in more than a quarter century, whether you like the terms or not—is perched on the edge of a diplomatic cliff.

Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last spring, just a couple of weeks after Macron’s election to the French Presidency. If there had been a fight card for the encounter, it would have pitted globalism vs. nationalism, progressivism vs. populism, optimism vs. declinism, youth vs. age. At a meeting in the morning, the two men tugged at each other’s forearms as though they were trying to pull a rope over a line in the sand. That afternoon, at a photo call with the rest of the group, Macron performed a cheeky little fake-out before finally extending his hand to Trump, who yanked it as though he were trying to start a chainsaw. Handshakeologists the world over were thus surprised when, a couple of months later, Macron invited Trump to France.Macron, speaking of the historic alliance between the two countries, “which fully justifies the presence of President Trump today and tomorrow in Paris,” gave Trump a grand reception. There was a Bastille Day parade with vintage tanks and a flyover of the Arc de Triomphe; the Presidents and their wives dined at the Eiffel Tower on a solicitously bland menu of filet of beef and chocolate soufflé with chocolate ice cream. By the next day, Trump—who, in previous months had pulled out of the Paris climate accords, claimed that parts of Paris were so “radicalized and vicious” that the police refused to go there, and expressed his admiration for the far-right leader Marine Le Pen—was praising the French leader as “a great President, a tough President.” Macron—who had previously trolled Trump over his environmental policies, unfurling a “Make Our Planet Great Again” meme on Twitter—now said, “I very much respect the decision taken by President Trump” on the Paris accords, even if he disagreed with it, and affirmed that he and Trump shared a “common red line” on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Thus was born the idea that there exists some kind of special closeness not between America and France but between Trump and Macron.Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last spring, just a couple of weeks after Macron’s election to the French Presidency.

By the next day, Trump—who, in previous months had pulled out of the Paris climate accords, claimed that parts of Paris were so “radicalized and vicious” that the police refused to go there, and expressed his admiration for the far-right leader Marine Le Pen—was praising the French leader as “a great President, a tough President.” Macron—who had previously trolled Trump over his environmental policies, unfurling a “Make Our Planet Great Again” meme on Twitter—now said, “I very much respect the decision taken by President Trump” on the Paris accords, even if he disagreed with it, and affirmed that he and Trump shared a “common red line” on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Thus was born the idea that there exists some kind of special closeness not between America and France but between Trump and Macron."

Last Tuesday, after waking up to tweet about the previous day’s F.B.I.
raid on his lawyer’s office (“A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”), President Trump
called one of his outside Republican advisers to ask what to do about
Syria, and its latest chemical-weapons attack on civilians. “We should
bomb the shit out of them, Mr. President,” came the answer, which was
exactly the one Trump seemed to be looking for. Over the weekend, the
President, outraged by the photographs of dead children in the Syrian
enclave of Douma he had apparently seen on TV, had tweeted vows of
retaliation against “Animal Assad,” and the Syrian leader’s backers in
Russia and Iran. Trump’s hawkish new national-security adviser, John Bolton, who had started work that Monday, was also pressing for
punishing strikes. On the phone call, Trump listened approvingly to the
hit-’em-hard advice: that, politically, “the minimum should be bigger
than it was last year,” when Trump had launched a single-day strike on a
Syrian airfield, designed—unsuccessfully, as it turned out—to deter
future chemical-weapons use.By Friday evening, when the American cruise missiles actually started
flying, the vaunted attack had been reduced to a single predawn volley
against three Syrian government chemical-weapons facilities, carefully
chosen to avoid hitting known Russian or Iranian bases and thus
escalating a war from which Trump himself had recently demanded an exit.
The strike was bigger than last year’s, but hardly the sustained
response with “all instruments of our national power” that the President
promised in his televised address announcing the attack.Last Tuesday, after waking up to tweet about the previous day’s F.B.I.

Among the myriad unpredictable events of 2017 are the literary successes
of women this season. Who would have predicted that among the most
talked-about writings of the year would be a very new, very short story, and a
very old, very long epic? Kristen Roupenian’s début, “Cat Person,” has struck a chord, or a nerve,
in its artful rendering of a predicament queasily familiar to many
female readers: that moment in an intimate interaction between
near-strangers in which sexual revulsion and social politesse are in
opposition, and the impulse to act on the former is repressed in favor
of adhering to the latter. (This week, Roupenian signed a seven-figure
book deal.) Meanwhile, the Odyssey has been granted fresh relevance with Emily Wilson’s new translation, the first in English by a woman, which has been widely praised for its immediacy and accessibility, making it an unlikely beach read.
Wilson, a British-born classicist who teaches at the University of
Pennsylvania, renders the famous first line of Homer’s epic, the poet’s
address to the Muse, as “Tell me about a complicated man”—a spin on the
Greek word polytropos, which has variously been translated as
“cunning” or “of twists and turns.” Wilson’s choice feels startling and
modern: one of the world’s oldest stories transposed to the vernacular
of Facebook.Add to that classical recapitulation another: “Women & Power,” by Mary
Beard, the Cambridge University classicist, cultural critic, and
feminist. This book, which consists of two lectures Beard delivered, in
2014 and 2017, under the aegis of the London Review of Books, deftly
brings into conjunction the contemporary themes undergirding the embrace
of “Cat Person”—questions about sex and subjection, about gender and
control—with those longer-standing ideas about the potency of women, or
its absence, that are contained within the Odyssey and the tradition of
which it is a foundational text. Beard’s is a very short book about a
very long past with a very current relevance. #MeToo has been #ThemToo for millennia.Among the myriad unpredictable events of 2017 are the literary successes

Donald Trump as a real-estate showman, and with Jane Mayer’s revealing
portrait of the ghostwriter behind Trump’s “The Art of the Deal.” Others
are riveting stories from recent years that are still finding new

that might hit the Pacific Northwest; Lawrence Wright’s months-long
investigation into the Church of Scientology; a deeply personal essay by
Meghan O’Rourke about her experience living with an autoimmune disease; an
exploration, by Adrian Chen, of the conversion of a prized daughter of
the Westboro Baptist Church. There are evergreen pieces that address
enduring areas of human concern, such as John Hersey’s groundbreaking
report, published in 1946, on six survivors of the atomic explosion in Hiroshima. And, of course, there is fiction—by Junot Díaz, Annie Proulx,

Angela Merkel is not going to resign as the Chancellor of Germany. “No,
that’s not on the table,” she said, with a small, suppressed smile, when
asked, by one of two interviewers for the German television broadcaster
ZDF, if that prospect had, “in quiet moments,” occurred to her. She
hasn’t had many quiet moments this weekend, a juncture at which her job,
at least to observers, has never seemed more in danger—even if Merkel
herself doesn’t see it that way.Almost two months ago, her party, the center-right Christian Democratic
Union, and its Bavarian partner, the Christian Social Union, came in
first place in the elections for Germany’s legislature, the Bundestag.
But they didn’t have a majority: the C.D.U./C.S.U. coalition won just
less than thirty-three per cent of the vote, giving them two hundred and
forty-six seats out of seven hundred and nine. The Social Democrats, the
traditional center-left party, meanwhile, suffered a historic collapse,
winning only about twenty per cent, its poorest result since the days of
the Weimar Republic. And, worse, in keeping with the Weimar theme, the
far-right Alternative for Germany came in third, with more than
eleven per cent of the vote and ninety-four Bundestag seats. A party
so extreme hasn’t been in the Bundestag since the fall of the Third
Reich. It is not an acceptable coalition partner, for Merkel or for
anyone. The leaders of the Social Democrats didn’t want to form one,
either, on the theory that their party had done so poorly because no one
had any idea what it stood for anymore (it is, indeed, pretty hard to
tell), and being a junior coalition partner wouldn’t help. The obvious
alternative was for the C.D.U./C.S.U. to form a coalition with two even
smaller parties, the Greens, who have an environmentally focussed
progressive agenda, and the Free Democrats, who are business-friendly
conservatives. The Germans called this the Jamaika Koalition, because
the colors of the parties were, respectively, black, green, and yellow,
like the Jamaican flag, and also because German television-news
producers seemed to like illustrating long segments on politics with
pictures of beaches and palm trees.Angela Merkel is not going to resign as the Chancellor of Germany. “No,

This week, he’s in Bonn, Germany, at the global climate talks,
spearheading the drive to show that America’s states and cities have not
forsaken the promises made last year in Paris. On Saturday, barely a minute into his big prime-time talk, Brown was
rewarded for his pains with booing. He was visibly startled when
demonstrators interrupted his speech and began chanting, “Keep it in the
ground!”Pity him, then, but not too much. For one thing, Brown responded to the
challenge Trumpishly—“let’s put you in the ground,” he told the
protesters, who were led by indigenous and climate-justice activists.
And, for another, they were absolutely right; their slogans illustrated
the contradiction at the heart of the planet’s climate policy, one that
Brown, if he wanted to, could play a key role in solving.Spare a little pity for Jerry Brown. The California governor has been

In the late nineteen-thirties, as Benito Mussolini was preparing to host
the 1942 World’s Fair, in Rome, he oversaw the construction of a new
neighborhood, Esposizione Universale Roma, in the southwest of the city,
to showcase Italy’s renewed imperial grandeur. The centerpiece of the
district was the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, a sleek rectangular
marvel with a façade of abstract arches and rows of neoclassical statues
lining its base. In the end, the fair was cancelled because of the war,
but the palazzo, known as the Square Colosseum, still stands in Rome
today, its exterior engraved with a phrase from Mussolini’s speech, in
1935, announcing the invasion of Ethiopia, in which he described
Italians as “a people of poets, artists, heroes, saints, thinkers,
scientists, navigators, and transmigrants.” The invasion, and the bloody
occupation that followed, would later lead to war-crimes charges against
the Italian government. The building is, in other words, a relic of
abhorrent Fascist aggression. Yet, far from being shunned, it is
celebrated in Italy as a modernist icon. In 2004, the state recognized
the palazzo as a site of “cultural interest.” In 2010, a partial
restoration was completed, and five years later the fashion house Fendi
moved its global headquarters there.Italy, the first Fascist state, has had a long relationship with
right-wing politics; with the election of Silvio Berlusconi, in 1994,
the country also became the first to bring a neo-Fascist party to power, as part of Berlusconi’s center-right coalition.*
But this alone is not enough to explain Italians’ comfort with living
amid Fascist symbols. Italy was, after all, home to Western Europe’s
biggest anti-Fascist resistance and its most robust postwar Communist
Party. Until 2008, center-left coalitions maintained that legacy, often
getting more than forty per cent of the vote in elections. So why is it
that, as the United States has engaged in a contentious process of
dismantling monuments to its Confederate past, and France has rid itself
of all streets named after the Nazi collaborationist leader Marshall
Pétain, Italy has allowed its Fascist monuments to survive unquestioned?In the late nineteen-thirties, as Benito Mussolini was preparing to host

thoughts about the United Nations were bigger—and badder—this time
around.“Major portions of the world are in conflict, and some, in fact, are
going to hell,” Trump declared. He vowed to “totally destroy” North
Korea if it didn’t abandon its nuclear weapons and the intercontinental
ballistic missiles that deliver them. He came close to calling for
regime change in “reckless” Iran, for policies that “speak openly of
mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin
for many leaders and nations in this room.” Trump called the nuclear
deal—brokered by all the veto-wielding nations of the world body—“an
embarrassment” to the United States, implicitly insulting the European
allies that initiated the effort and the Security Council, which
unanimously endorsed it. He implied a willingness to use military action
in Venezuela “to help them regain their freedom, recover their country,
and restore their democracy.” He blasted Cuba and took sharp digs at
China and Russia.On Tuesday, Donald Trump made his début on the world stage—on

“Major portions of the world are in conflict, and some, in fact, are
going to hell,” Trump declared. He vowed to “totally destroy” North
Korea if it didn’t abandon its nuclear weapons and the intercontinental
ballistic missiles that deliver them. He came close to calling for
regime change in “reckless” Iran, for policies that “speak openly of
mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin
for many leaders and nations in this room.” Trump called the nuclear
deal—brokered by all the veto-wielding nations of the world body—“an
embarrassment” to the United States, implicitly insulting the European
allies that initiated the effort and the Security Council, which
unanimously endorsed it. He implied a willingness to use military action
in Venezuela “to help them regain their freedom, recover their country,
and restore their democracy.” He blasted Cuba and took sharp digs at
China and Russia."

For a couple of days, the dumbfounding Presidency of Donald Trump was
all about symphonies. On July 6th, in Warsaw, Trump gave a speech
purporting to defend Western civilization against unnamed forces—“from
inside or out, from the south or the east”—that threaten its values.
Presuming to speak for that civilization, Trump said, “We write
symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes . . .”
The Internet cried with one voice: “We write what?” Like many of
Trump’s utterances, the line was at once ludicrous and sinister. His
veneration for orchestral music came as a surprise to almost everyone,
and the implication that some cultures are incapable of creating
symphonies stirred bad memories. Jonathan Capehart
compared the passage to white-nationalist rhetoric about the genetic limitations
of inferior races. Sentences like “The fundamental question of our time
is whether the West has the will to survive” made me think of Oswald
Spengler’s “The Decline of the West,” a fixture of the alt-right reading
list. Will Bruckner now blast at Trump rallies in place of the Rolling
Stones? A Trump-approved
video celebrating his G-20 trip suggests no; the soundtrack is more in the
vein of the “We Are the World” parody “Musicians for Free-Range
Chickens.”The following night, probably not by coincidence, Trump went to the
symphony. During the G-20 meeting in Hamburg, the Elbphilharmonie, the
city’s fortresslike new concert
hall,
presented Beethoven’s Ninth. Trump attended in the company of Angela
Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and
other leaders. German television showed a chilling split-screen with
protesters on one side and tuxedoed musicians on the other. Cameras
caught the heads of state in various states of attentiveness: Trudeau
was chatty, Macron was ostentatiously rapt, Merkel looked preoccupied.
(Mark Swed, in the Los Angeles Times, has a
rundown of the responses.) Joachim Lux, of the Thalia Theatre, in Hamburg, called
the concert a “pornographic abuse of art.” In Lux’s view, the presence
of leaders who had trampled on human rights made a mockery of the
universal-brotherhood rhetoric of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” the anthem
of the European Union. You need not have gone that far to find the
spectacle a dispiriting muddle of art and politics, with Trump oozing at
the center.For a couple of days, the dumbfounding Presidency of Donald Trump was

Just when you think you’ve seen it all, out comes another Donald Trump
tweet, or tweetstorm, to prove you wrong. On Sunday morning, America’s
forty-fifth President, having just returned to Washington from the G-20
summit in Hamburg, Germany,
pronounced his trip “a great success for the United States.”It says something about Trump’s grip on reality that he could reach such
a conclusion after a summit in which he and the rest of the U.S.
delegation were utterly isolated on major issues such as climate change
and international trade. In fact, the only way that German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s diplomatic sherpas were able to cobble together a
communiqué that everyone could sign onto was to include a section that noted
America’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but which
added, “Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement
is irreversible.” The symbolism here was powerful: in a global forum
that the U.S. government, especially the Treasury Department, helped to
create during the late nineteen-nineties, Trump’s America stood alone.Just when you think you’ve seen it all, out comes another Donald Trump

This spring, news of a campaign of repression against gay men in Chechnya, a republic in Russia’s North Caucasus, began to appear in the United States and Europe. Dozens of men suspected of being gay were reportedly being held in secret prisons; many had been tortured, and several had died. Fifty members of Congress signed a letter calling on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to raise the issue of violence against gay men with Russian officials. The State Department released a statement saying that it was “increasingly concerned” about the situation and that it “categorically” condemned the “persecution of individuals based on their sexual orientation,” but to date neither Tillerson nor Donald Trump has spoken publicly about the issue. Other foreign leaders have not been so circumspect. Last month, in a meeting in Moscow, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to exert his influence to “insure that minorities’ rights are protected.” On May 29th, at a testy joint press conference in Paris, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, challenged Putin on the need to protect Chechnya’s gay community, saying, “I will be constantly vigilant on these issues.”In the years since the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechnya has fought two wars against Moscow’s rule, which have left tens of thousands dead and the republic in ruins. Islamist-inspired terrorism, and a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that emerged in response, have left the population deeply traumatized. Today, Chechnya has been rebuilt, and the Kremlin enjoys a nominal peace—but not without a cost. In exchange for professing loyalty to Putin and keeping Chechnya nominally part of Russia, its forty-year-old leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, is allowed to rule the republic as his own private fiefdom.This spring, news of a campaign of repression against gay men in Chechnya, a republic in Russia’s North Caucasus, began to appear in the United States and Europe.

On Thursday, a fine spring day in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump took to the podium in the White House’s Rose Garden and announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate-change agreement. In doing so, he was ignoring the advice of his senior economic advisers, many of his fellow-businessmen, and, reportedly, his own daughter and son-in-law. Ivanka Trump was nowhere to be seen at the announcement event, but Steve Bannon, the President’s chief strategist, was strutting around. That was the tip-off for the sort of address that Trump was about to deliver.On major occasions, Trump doesn’t do uplifting speeches: we know that by now. From the campaign stump to his remarks at the Republican Convention in Cleveland and his Inaugural Address, his big speeches have all been distinguished by their alarmism, fearmongering, and negativity. To be sure, he always promises to restore America to past glories, but that pledge is merely used as the coda to a jeremiad. His underlying theory of the case is always the same: the United States has been ripped off, exploited, and swindled.On Thursday, a fine spring day in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump took to the podium in the White House’s Rose Garden and announced that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate-change agreement.

On Wednesday, at around the time that news outlets were reporting that President Donald Trump had decided to pull America out of the Paris climate accord, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, was at the Berlin airport, greeting Premier Li Keqiang, of China. As their national anthems played, Li and Merkel stood on a red carpet that had been cut to look like a giant arrow. It seemed to point definitively away from Trump. There was a connection between the two moments that was more than symbolic. China has made it clear that, with America’s abdication, it sees Paris as a vehicle for its efforts to assert itself as a leader of the international community. (Whether this means that it would also make sure that carbon emissions fell is another matter.) And Merkel, during the past few days, seemed to have had it with Trump, in some significant measure because of his flashy contempt for the climate deal and for his fellow world leaders.That contempt was well on display on Thursday afternoon, when Trump confirmed America’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. In his remarks, delivered in the Rose Garden, Trump attacked not only the terms of the deal but also the goodwill of those who argued for it. He spoke like a man unravelling a conspiracy or a con job. The climate accord had been pushed by America’s economic rivals, whose real reason for wanting us to stay in was “so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound,” and by “global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.” Paris was just a “scheme to redistribute wealth outside of the United States.” Only Trump really cared about the environment, and he would get a much better deal for it.On Wednesday, at around the time that news outlets were reporting that President Donald Trump had decided to pull America out of the Paris climate accord, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, was at the Berlin airport, greeting Premier Li Keqiang, of China.

Even when a moment designed to affirm some of America’s basic principles is dangled before him, President Donald Trump has a way of batting it aside. In Brussels on Thursday, as he stood at a rostrum at a ceremony in front of the new NATO headquarters, Trump had, to his left, a mangled girder from the World Trade Center; to his right, broken slabs of the Berlin Wall, both of which were being dedicated as memorials; and, behind him, the leaders of the twenty-seven other countries in the alliance. One of them, Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had just delivered remarks that served as a reminder that, until she was thirty-five years old, she had lived behind that wall, and had been part of the civic movement that peacefully reunified Germany. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary-General of NATO, who had introduced Merkel, noted that she had been among the crowds filling the streets of East Berlin on the night the Wall came down. A few minutes later, when Stoltenberg introduced Trump, he summoned a personal connection for him, too, noting that the 9/11 terrorists “struck at the heart of your own home town, New York.” That attack marked the only time that NATO has invoked Article 5 of its charter, the mutual-defense provision, which the new headquarters’ 9/11 memorial was also supposed to commemorate. In what may have been an attempt at Trump-friendly sloganeering, Stoltenberg summed up Article 5 by declaring, gamely, “All for one, and one for all!” But Trump had come to praise other ideals, other lands, and other leaders.He had just come from Saudi Arabia, Trump told the NATO leaders, in a brief speech. “There, I spent much time with King Salman, a wise man who wants to see things get much better rapidly.” That meeting had been “historic,” Trump said. The “leaders of the Middle East” had promised him that they would “stop funding the radical ideology that leads to this horrible terrorism all over the globe.” So that should take care of the problem. He did not define “radical ideology,” or acknowledge that he was praising a monarch in what seemed to be an attempt to put the assembled elected leaders of democracies to shame. Trump’s world view seems to combine a distaste for Islam with a predilection for monarchs of any background—for anyone with a decent palace, really. In viewing his world travels, that mixture can be confusing, but it should not be mistaken for a sign of budding tolerance. (As has been widely noted, Trump once called Brussels a “hellhole,” on account of its large number of immigrants—many of whom came from countries whose repressive leaders had joined him at the summit in Riyadh. He has said similar things about Paris: “No one wants to go to Paris anymore.” When Trump was in Riyadh, though, he couldn’t stop talking about how fancy the new buildings were.) He did express his sympathy to Prime Minister Theresa May, of the United Kingdom, who was also in attendance, for the Manchester attack (“terrible thing”), and called for a moment of silence to honor the dead. But he quickly moved to chastising the leaders for not having taken seriously enough the need for building walls, rather than taking them down.Even when a moment designed to affirm some of America’s basic principles is dangled before him, President Donald Trump has a way of batting it aside.

The “lowest blow,” according to the French magazine Marianne, came somewhere around the twenty-minute mark of a psychologically violent debate that took place in Paris on Wednesday night between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, ahead of this Sunday’s second and final round of the French Presidential election. Unluckily for Le Pen, who is behind in the polls, the conversation was stalled on economic issues. After she confused two major companies—“One makes phones, the other makes turbines,” Macron offered—she appeared desperate to change the subject. The possibility of creating a sovereign investment fund for the French state came up, and, as Macron began to explain in goat-gettingly didactic tones why that probably wasn’t a good idea, Le Pen attacked. “I see you’re looking to play student and teacher with me, but, as far as I’m concerned, that’s not really my thing,” she said.With her mention of giving lessons, Le Pen was possibly echoing François Mitterrand’s reproach of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing—“I’m not your student,” he said, in a debate in 1981—and definitely taking a shot at the romantic life of Macron and his wife, Brigitte Trogneux. They met in 1993, when Macron was in Trogneux’s drama class at a Jesuit high school in Amiens. He was fifteen. She was twenty-four years older, married, with three children. (One can’t help but wonder what Trogneux’s ex-husband must make of the double freak occurrence of losing his wife to a teen-ager, only to have him turn out, decades later, to be the presumptive Président de la République.) Her elder daughter, Laurence, was in Macron’s class. According to “Un Jeune Homme Si Parfait” (in English, the title would be “Such a Perfect Young Man”), a new book by Anne Fulda, when Macron’s parents heard about the affair, they initially thought their son was seeing Laurence. “You don’t understand, you already have your life,” Macron’s mother reportedly told a tearful Trogneux, who refused to promise to break off the affair. “He won’t have children!” He has no biological children, but he is close to his stepchildren, all of whom have been active in his campaign, and even his step-grandchildren, one of whom he was pictured feeding a bottle to, in Paris Match.The “lowest blow,” according to the French magazine Marianne, came somewhere around the twenty-minute mark of a psychologically violent debate that took place in Paris on Wednesday night between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, ahead of this Sunday’s second and final round of the French Presidential election. Unluckily for Le Pen, who is behind in the polls, the conversation was stalled on economic issues. After she confused two major companies—“One makes phones, the other makes turbines,” Macron offered—she appeared desperate to change the subject.

The international project of flattering Ivanka Trump—which some of the world's most notable women, from Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, to Queen Máxima, of the Netherlands, engaged in at a panel discussion during the W20 conference, in Berlin, this week—does not always run smoothly. There was, first, the achingly obvious oddity of deciding that Trump, whose experience on the public stage largely consists of marketing her clothing and jewelry lines, and her efforts to get her father, Donald Trump, elected, was qualified to sit between Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, and Chrystia Freeland, the Foreign Minister of Canada. That was quickly followed by the dispiriting thought that Trump might actually have as much power over people’s lives as the other women, through the influence that she supposedly wields over her father. Why else would the head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, have co-authored an op-ed in the Financial Times with her, on the importance of promoting female entrepreneurship? Their insights include this: ""mentorship opportunities and access to networks bring learning opportunities and connections to capital and markets.” There are probably many people in the world who would like to mentor Trump and have access to her networks. It might even explain why Merkel invited her to Berlin, a move that the German press praised as ""klug,"" or clever, in terms of opening a route to President Trump—and why Merkel suggested, from the stage, that the World Bank look at ways to get funding to women entrepreneurs in the developing world, and then, at an event afterward, complimented Ivanka for supporting the idea. But that is also where it all got a little bit confusing, as things tend to with the Trumps.At some point during her Berlin sojourn, Trump spoke to Mike Allen, the political journalist. Allen ran an item on Axios with the headline ""Ivanka Trump's new fund for female entrepreneurs,"" illustrated with a photograph of Trump grazing her fingers on one of the slabs that make up Berlin's Holocaust memorial. ""Ivanka Trump told me yesterday from Berlin that she has begun building a massive fund that will benefit female entrepreneurs around the globe,"" Allen wrote. He added that contributors would include companies and governments—Canada, Germany, ""and a few Middle Eastern countries"" had already made ""quiet commitments""—and that ""President Trump is a huge supporter of his daughter's idea, and she has consulted with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim about how to pull it off in a huge way."" Double huge. It sounded a lot like the Clinton Foundation, or like any number of corporate or N.G.O. initiatives, except that Ivanka Trump's office is in the White House. This raised a flurry of questions: What about conflicts? Would this be a for-profit operation or a shakedown one? In a few hours, it became clear that it was neither of those—because ""Ivanka Trump's new fund"" was a complete misnomer. This would be a World Bank project, as spokesmen for the White House and the bank emphasized. Trump would not be involved in raising money, managing it, or deciding how it would be spent. But the World Bank wanted everyone to know that it was very, very grateful to Ivanka for promoting the fund, or ""facility,"" as it would be called.

Why are we spending so much time trying to match what Donald J. Trump says to reality? Is it because he is the President of the United States, and could start a war with words? Or because we place some sort of value on the truth, or on the meaning of words? Whatever the source of our folly, it is, from the President’s perspective, just that: a big waste of time. Reality will contort itself to match his imagination—his Presidentialness—all on its own. He doesn’t even need to sign laws, let alone accurately describe what he wants to do. He is in the White House; the world and time bend.That, at any rate, is among the secondary conclusions that one can draw from Trump’s interview, over the weekend, with Julie Pace, the White House correspondent for the Associated Press. (The primary one is familiar: the country is in unsteady hands.) To take one example, Pace asked Trump about his assertions, during the campaign, that he would designate China as a currency manipulator (a label that has consequences under U.S. trade law) for suppressing the value of its currency in order to prop up its exports. China had once done so, but since about 2014, it has basically been engaged in the reverse practice: propping up its currency to stop capital flight. But that is not a timeline that Trump recognizes. According to the A.P.’s transcript (which includes, at a number of points, the note “unintelligible”), after he explained that, “No. 1,” his not calling China the names that he had called it during the campaign gave him the “flexibility” to demand that it now do something about North Korea, the President and his interviewer had this exchange:Why are we spending so much time trying to match what Donald J.

For years now, it has been fashionable on the right to argue that Europe is heading for Armageddon, that it could not survive the consequences of mass immigration, stifling bureaucracy, an overweening welfare state, and restrictive labor laws. This dark view isn’t restricted to believers in Samuel Huntington’s “Clash of Civilizations” thesis and Trumpian ethno-nationalists, though it is widely shared in those quarters. Last year, I heard a well-travelled and urbane British banker argue for a “leave” vote in the Brexit referendum on the grounds that the European Union was destined to collapse anyway, and it would be better for the United Kingdom to be on the outside when the inevitable happened.Perhaps the catastrophists will eventually be proved right.

One morning last May, Can Dündar, a Turkish journalist, was standing outside an Istanbul courthouse, waiting for a judge to reach a verdict on his guilt or innocence, when a man rushed toward him with a gun. A year earlier, Dündar’s newspaper, Cumhuriyet, a daily favored by Turkey’s secular left, had published video footage of truckloads of weapons being smuggled to Syrian rebels by Turkish state intelligence agents. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose government had denied that it was supplying the rebels, was outraged and vowed that Dündar, then editor-in-chief, would “pay a heavy price.” Dündar was arrested and charged with aiding a terrorist organization and with espionage, among other crimes. “Traitor!” the gunman shouted as he fired two shots in Dündar’s direction. Dündar’s wife, Dilek, along with a member of parliament, grabbed the gunman, and video of the scene shows the three in an odd, lumbering half-embrace until the man is ordered to drop his gun. After the shooting, Dündar looked a bit ruffled but was uncannily composed. “I am fine. I am fine,” he told reporters. “Nobody should worry. Please be calm. There is nothing wrong. My wife jumped on him. So I want to congratulate her.” Glancing at Dilek, he smiled. “Thank you. Thank you.”When the court reconvened, a short time later, one of the judges apologized to Dündar for the shooting and then sentenced him to five years and ten months in prison for revealing state secrets. Dündar appealed the conviction and, free, pending the outcome, left for Barcelona to work on a book. At that point, Dündar was hopeful that he could get a fair trial in Turkey and intended to return. But, last July, his plans changed. President Erdoğan declared a state of emergency in response to an attempted coup, leading to a crackdown on ostensible opponents: he eventually fired more than a hundred thousand public workers, jailed opposition politicians and journalists, and arrested judges, two of whom sat on the constitutional court. Convinced of the utter impossibility of a fair trial, Dündar took up an offer to come to Germany to write a column for the German newspaper Die Zeit.

On Thursday morning, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson left Moscow after a two-day visit. Not too long ago, the trip had been expected to signal a kind of grand rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia—but, after President Trump ordered a missile strike against the Syrian government, last week, those expectations gave way to nervousness and even talk of possible military confrontation. What ultimately took place was something rather milquetoast—Tillerson left with U.S.-Russian relations neither on the path to fairy-tale good will (what Trump’s campaign promises led some in Moscow to daydream about) nor at a disconcerting standoff (which the Trump Administration’s inconsistent, at times belligerent, rhetoric of recent days had led some to fear).In the end, the meeting between Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov featured the same tropes that defined summits with Tillerson’s predecessors, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry: a long list of grievances directed at the U.S. by the Russian side; a basic disagreement over the role of Bashar al-Assad and the preferred contours of a political solution to the civil war in Syria; and vague expressions of optimism with little in the way of concrete breakthroughs. U.S.-Russian relations in the Vladimir Putin era have for some time functioned like a long-running repertory play and, in Moscow this week, all the actors again hewed to the script, and played the roles they were expected to.On Thursday morning, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson left Moscow after a two-day visit.

And, perhaps more to the point, Germany has never had a trade deal with the U.S., nor has the E.U.Trump’s trade ignorance was all the more remarkable considering that a centerpiece of his Presidential run was the argument that international trade deals had led to the downfall of the American worker, and that he alone could fix it.

There was much talk recently about the evening that Justin Trudeau and Ivanka Trump spent side by side, sitting together at the Schoenfeld Theatre to watch the Canadian musical “Come from Away.” As it happened, my wife and I were present at the performance, and not that far from the odd couple. (I was there only by virtue of residual Canadianness, having been asked to be a semi-official host, helping to celebrate the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the Canadian Confederation—a scary thought, for me, since I can still clearly recall the hundredth anniversary, at Montreal’s beautiful Expo 67.) An unease, it should be said, ran around the theatre, dampened properly by the fixed Canadian rules of politeness, which make all other forms of politeness look like a policy for rudeness. (My favorite Canadian joke: “How do you get twenty-five Canadians out of a pool?” You say, “Please get out of the pool.”) The problem, of course—hard to articulate—was that, while the heavily Canadian audience recognized that what Justin was doing in “dating” Ivanka, so to speak, was admirable and understandable, the room also recognized that accepting Ivanka as a natural companion for one of the world’s remaining liberal leaders was one more step in normalizing the abnormal.Justin, a true Prince Charming in ease and appeal—a leader of the Obama generation, not at all like his cerebral father—was doing the gracious thing by squiring Ivanka, and, given that the court of the Mad King will likely remain a fundamental fact for his tenure, having a positive relationship with the glamorous princess is perhaps a tactic as well as a courtesy. The papers said that both Justin and Ivanka enjoyed the show, and I’m sure they did. It’s hard not to. “Come from Away” is a lovely, inspiriting, and very Canadian musical by the husband-and-wife team of Irene Sankoff and David Hein. It tells the story of a few thousand passengers who were, in the panic after 9/11, diverted to a largely unused international airport in Gander, Newfoundland, where they stayed among the locals for four or five days. The highlight of the show’s many rousing and funny numbers is a song about being inducted into Newfoundland by drinking the local tipple, Screech, and kissing a cod. (I say, as one who has drunk some Screech, kiss the fish.)There was much talk recently about the evening that Justin Trudeau and Ivanka Trump spent side by side, sitting together at the Schoenfeld Theatre to watch the Canadian musical “Come from Away.” As it happened, my wife and I were present at the performance, and not that far from the odd couple. (I was there only by virtue of residual Canadianness, having been asked to be a semi-official host, helping to celebrate the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the Canadian Confederation—a scary thought, for me, since I can still clearly recall the hundredth anniversary, at Montreal’s beautiful Expo 67.) An unease, it should be said, ran around the theatre, dampened properly by the fixed Canadian rules of politeness, which make all other forms of politeness look like a policy for rudeness. (My favorite Canadian joke: “How do you get twenty-five Canadians out of a pool?” You say, “Please get out of the pool.”) The problem, of course—hard to articulate—was that, while the heavily Canadian audience recognized that what Justin was doing in “dating” Ivanka, so to speak, was admirable and understandable, the room also recognized that accepting Ivanka as a natural companion for one of the world’s remaining liberal leaders was one more step in normalizing the abnormal.
Justin, a true Prince Charming in ease and appeal—a leader of the Obama generation, not at all like his cerebral father—was doing the gracious thing by squiring Ivanka, and, given that the court of the Mad King will likely remain a fundamental fact for his tenure, having a positive relationship with the glamorous princess is perhaps a tactic as well as a courtesy. The papers said that both Justin and Ivanka enjoyed the show, and I’m sure they did.

Ida Tin wanted to build an app to help women track their periods. For months, she went door to door, pitching the concept to early-stage investors in Berlin, London, New York, and Silicon Valley. Often, Tin, a soft-spoken thirty-seven-year-old from Copenhagen with cerulean-framed glasses, was the only woman in the room. Many potential investors balked at the notion of software with inputs for levels of menstrual bleeding, breast tenderness, and sex drive, or the capacity to digitally share windows of ovulation with a partner. Time and again, Tin told me, the men sitting across from her in pitch meetings said, “I only invest in products I can use myself.” The idea embarrassed even some who saw its business potential; one venture capitalist who eventually made a small investment insisted that his involvement be kept private. But Tin persisted, cobbling together fifty thousand euros. She launched the app, called Clue, in 2013, basing it in Berlin. It quietly amassed millions of active users, primarily in the United States. “This was clearly not a niche product,” Tin said. This past November, Clue announced that it had closed a twenty-million-euro round of funding.Tin’s experience highlights a blind spot in the global investment community, which has been eager to throw cash at the next food-delivery or ride-sharing app but tends to shun products by and for women—or else hangs back and lets them twist in the wind for too long. When it comes to menstruation-related products, and technologies catering to women’s health more broadly, Tin said, “there’s still a social taboo.” This squeamishness may come as little surprise, given the demographics of the venture-capital world. A recent study of the top hundred V.C. firms around the world found that just seven per cent of active investing partners are women, and that companies founded by women have received just a tenth of global venture-round funding. Yet the demand is inarguably there. The international market for feminine-hygiene products—physical items like tampons and sanitary pads—is projected to hit forty billion dollars by 2020, according to the market-research firm Global Industry Analysts. For decades, the space has been dominated by consumer-goods giants like Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, which have had little incentive to develop new technologies. And the barrier to entry for newcomers, no matter how scrappy, is enormous. It took more than a year for Ridhi Tariyal, a Harvard engineer, and her business partner Stephen Gire to find investors willing to stomach their invention—a “smart” tampon dubbed NextGen Jane, capable of testing menstrual blood for warning signs of cancer and reproductive diseases.Ida Tin wanted to build an app to help women track their periods.

As a Presidential candidate, Donald Trump led a charmed existence. Whatever he said, no matter how outrageous, it didn't seem to hurt him. He could insult his Republican opponents, make misogynistic comments about female journalists, call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, describe Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, trot out blatant falsehoods by the dozen, encourage the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail account—none of it proved damaging to his candidacy. As he famously remarked, it was as if he could go out and shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue “and I wouldn't lose voters.”Now things have changed. He might never admit it, but Trump has belatedly discovered a basic principle of politics: words matter. They matter so much, in fact, that they can make or break a Presidency. That's why every one of his predecessors—during the modern era, at least—has chosen his words carefully. It took a few weeks for it to become clear that President Trump, as opposed to candidate Trump, would be subject to this principle. But, at this stage, there can be no doubt about it. Virtually every day brings a fresh example of his own loose words coming back to hurt him.As a Presidential candidate, Donald Trump led a charmed existence.

President Donald Trump’s first two weeks in office have produced what seems like a year’s worth of drama, but he has made essentially two consequential decisions. He issued a ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries and he nominated Neil Gorsuch, a federal appeals-court judge, to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant after Antonin Scalia’s death, last year.The immigration ban, a dubious policy that no serious counterterrorism expert believes is necessary, threw the Trump Administration into chaos, alienated large swaths of the federal government, offended international allies, and divided the Republican Party. The announcement of Gorsuch, who, whatever one thinks of his legal views, is clearly qualified to serve on the Court, was executed professionally and united the G.O.P. behind Trump.President Donald Trump’s first two weeks in office have produced what seems like a year’s worth of drama, but he has made essentially two consequential decisions.

With the evacuation of the last of its armed rebels and their families, last month, the Syrian city of Aleppo is once again in the hands of the Assad government. Aleppo had a prewar population of more than two million people; it was not only Syria’s largest city and its industrial powerhouse but had an iconic place as one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities, with a history dating back some eight thousand years. Before the war, Aleppo’s wealth of ancient buildings and its cosmopolitan mix of sects and peoples—Sunni Arabs, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, Alawites, Circassians, Chechens, Greeks, Assyrian and Armenian Christians, and even a few Jews—made it a matchless place in the modern Middle East. It remains to be seen what, of all that, has survived.The fighting and destruction will go on elsewhere in Syria. The combined Syrian-government-Russian-Iranian military offensive that crushed resistance in Aleppo after months of sustained bombardment will undoubtedly soon move southwest to the province of Idlib, bordering Turkey, where most of Aleppo’s evacuees have congregated. The ISIS “caliphate” of Raqqa has yet to be reconquered, along with numerous smaller Syrian towns and cities. But Aleppo’s fall is a momentous milestone, and probably marks the beginning of the end for Syria’s myriad rebel factions, five and a half years after their uprising began.With the evacuation of the last of its armed rebels and their families, last month, the Syrian city of Aleppo is once again in the hands of the Assad government.

Compared to the laborious process of replacing an American President, the British system of transferring power is very rapid. On Wednesday afternoon, David Cameron, the Prime Minister for the past six years, was driven from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace, where he submitted his resignation to the Queen, a formality that goes back centuries. About an hour later, the metal gates that separate Downing Street from Whitehall were opened again, this time to admit the new Prime Minister, Theresa May, who had also been to the Palace, where she had formally accepted the job that, as the new leader of the ruling Conservative Party, she was constitutionally entitled to take up.That was that: parliamentary government in action. After three weeks of political turmoil, following a referendum in which the British electorate voted narrowly to leave the European Union, the country had its second-ever female leader, the fifty-nine-year-old daughter of an Anglican clergyman, born in the sleepy south-coast resort town of Eastbourne. (My colleague Amy Davidson wrote on Monday about how May won the leadership.)Compared to the laborious process of replacing an American President, the British system of transferring power is very rapid.

Elie Wiesel, who died on Saturday, wrote fifty-seven books, yet the obituaries and tributes refer to him more consistently as a witness than a writer. His moral authority, which he earned and sought, derived from his experience, not any literary virtuosity, though the spare, confessional prose of his most widely read books—his ability to remember suffered details, and describe their shock on a thinking, pious youth—gave his testimony popular momentum. “Night”—his early masterpiece from the fifties, which eventually sold in the millions—famously recounted how a child was hanged before all in Wiesel’s death camp, slowly suffocating, too light to break his own neck: “Behind me, I heard [a] man asking: ‘Where is God now?’ And I heard a voice within me answer him: ‘. . . Here He is—He is hanging here on this gallows.’ ” In “One Generation After,” a memoir published in 1970, he writes of the former head of a yeshiva in Galicia, who bonded with him in Auschwitz. The teacher—who seemed to know the entire Talmud by heart—urged him to “preserve his soul” by studying with him:The first time I saw him speak, at a packed Montreal synagogue in the late sixties, his prestige was already growing. “The binding of Isaac was not God’s test of man,” I recall Wiesel telling us in the synagogue, stroking back his wispy hair, erudite, quoting Rabbi Nachman, speaking elegant, softly cadenced English in a Transylvanian accent—which only added to his charisma. “The binding of Isaac was man’s test of God.” In the case of Abraham, God passed, barely. Wiesel did not need to add that his failures would mount. Our speaker, in contrast, had written for Israeli newspapers, which seemed a novel triumph of Abrahamic justice and power.Elie Wiesel, who died on Saturday, wrote fifty-seven books, yet the obituaries and tributes refer to him more consistently as a witness than a writer.

“Isn’t the soul supposed to be immortal?” I asked innocently.
We were digging. He stopped, as if unwilling to hear his own words, and replied: “You will learn that this is neither the place nor the time to speak of immortality.” . . . In the end, resolution gave way and followed the body: weakened one like the other, one by the other.
A miserable crust of moldy bread came to contain more truth, more eternity than all the pages of all the books put together.

Paris is the tourist capital of Europe, but Brussels is its real capital. A famously unglamorous city, it is home to many of the key institutions of the European Union—the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the European Parliament (which also meets in Strasbourg, France). It is known mostly for its high concentration of Eurocrats and postwar Brutalist architecture (outside the Old Town), and, lately, for the Islamic extremists who inhabit its drab suburb of Molenbeek, which lies to the west of the city center.Since the terrorist attacks in Paris last November, some of whose perpetrators lived in Molenbeek, Belgian authorities have been afraid that it was only a matter of time before fanatics struck closer to home. Just after Christmas, police in Brussels announced that they had broken up a plot to attack crowds gathered in the historic Grand Place during New Year’s festivities. The planned event was cancelled, and the country’s Prime Minister, Charles Michel, said in a televised address, ""I believe that we are being confronted with a new stage in the history of Europe. The European authorities need to do more. We have to defend our way of life, our freedom to go to the cinema, to go to the theatre, to go out. We all have to be mobilized.”Paris is the tourist capital of Europe, but Brussels is its real capital. A famously unglamorous city, it is home to many of the key institutions of the European Union—the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the European Parliament (which also meets in Strasbourg, France).

On Saturday, at least three groups of marchers assembled outside the main train station in Cologne, Germany. They had each come to offer their response to the attacks on women who had gathered in that spot a week earlier, to celebrate New Year’s Eve. The first march was organized by Pegida, the anti-immigrant organization that emerged in the former East Germany and has been holding regular demonstrations in cities across the country. The second was an anti-Pegida counterdemonstration, organized in part by leftist activists who accused Pegida of raising the specter of Germany’s fascist past. Demonstration and counterdemonstration were at such loggerheads that the Pegida march was delayed and then, before the marchers—some of whom were throwing bottles—had got very far, police officers wielding water cannons broke it up. Both sides claimed to be fighting for the future of Germany. Before their confrontation, though, a third demonstration had completed its route. That one was protesting violence against women, and many of the marchers had heard about it through social media or else had joined spontaneously. Of the three, it spoke most directly to the events of New Year’s Eve.That night, as revellers filled the station platforms and—following a dubious German tradition—tossed firecrackers, they were pushed out into already crowded streets. There, groups of men who, according to eye-witness accounts and subsequent police investigations, were primarily foreigners from nations in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Balkans, targeted women and surrounded them. Some of the men groped and taunted them, while others stole their wallets and their cell phones. According to a preliminary police report leaked to the magazine Der Spiegel, ""Women, accompanied or not, literally ran a 'gauntlet' through masses of heavily intoxicated men that words cannot describe."" The atmosphere was ""chaotic and shameless."" Women reported men grabbing at their breasts and between their legs, among other violent and sexual assaults. With the press of the crowd, there was nowhere for the women to go and, although they screamed for help, the police had no effective response; the report described them as overwhelmed, and some witnesses said that they seemed to stand by in confusion. The police report expressed relief that no one was killed, but that appears to have been a matter of luck, not the result of any actions on the part of law enforcement. The chief of police has already been pushed into early retirement.On Saturday, at least three groups of marchers assembled outside the main train station in Cologne, Germany.

Responding to the news, particularly in a year like 2015, isn’t easy. The national conversation seemed to veer from malarkey to tragedy and then back again. Fortunately, though, there are writers who carry us through the news cycle by dispensing with foolishness and seeking perspective from sadness. Amy Davidson does both—and a lot more, too, such as adding historical insights to discussions in which the past is often forgotten.Here are fifteen of her most important pieces in this past, very strange, year, in chronological order.Responding to the news, particularly in a year like 2015, isn’t easy.

Last month, I published a piece in the magazine, “Blood Ties,” about one of the strangest murder stories I’ve ever encountered. The crime, committed in the spring of 1985, entailed the brutal slaughter of a married couple in late middle age, just outside Lynchburg, Virginia. Half a year after the events, the police conducted their first interview with Jens Soering, a German scholarship student at the University of Virginia who was dating the murdered couple’s daughter, Elizabeth Haysom. Soering and Haysom fled after the interview, and travelled across Europe and Asia. When they were captured, in London, for unrelated check frauds, a detective and a prosecutor from Virginia flew to the U.K. to question them. This time, under sustained interrogation, with no lawyer present, Soering offered a confession for the murders. Although he later rescinded the account, saying that he had been trying to protect Haysom—she was actually the killer, he said—he was tried, found guilty, and given two life sentences. Habeas-corpus petitions brought no relief, and, since 1990, he has served his time in state prisons. Haysom, who pleaded guilty as an accessory before the fact, is also incarcerated, with a ninety-year sentence. Both Haysom and Soering have written books and articles from behind bars.Recently, a curious political drama erupted in the wake of this old case. Soering has long held that he’s innocent. Like Haysom, he has never been paroled. Seeking avenues of redress in the late two-thousands, he found another possible option. An obscure agreement of the Council of Europe meant that he could be repatriated to Germany, with the approval of Germany and Virginia. Because Soering had already served the maximum German prison time for his conviction and record, this repatriation could allow for his release on European soil.Last month, I published a piece in the magazine, “Blood Ties,” about one of the strangest murder stories I’ve ever encountered.

On a recent blustery Sunday, I joined a tour group huddled by a schoolyard fence in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. A gust of wind pushed dead leaves across the basketball court as Ali, a Sudanese refugee, blew into his hands. He was showing us the Gerhart-Hauptmann School, an abandoned edifice from whose rooftop he had threatened to jump when, last summer, police tried to evict six hundred refugees who were living there. Ali continues to live at the school with twenty-three others; together with Mo, a guide from Somalia who was among the hundreds relocated from the school to a camp outside the city, he explained that the eviction effort had lasted more than nine days, involving more than seventeen hundred police officers and costing the city five million euros.About a dozen of us were present outside the school, attracting uneasy glances from the security guards posted just inside the locked gate. We were participating in the inaugural outing of Refugee Voices, a donation-based “solidarity tour” that allows sympathetic locals and tourists a peek at Berlin’s subculture of asylum seekers and their allies. Other stops on our tour included Oranienplatz, a nearby square famous for activist gatherings, and Görlitzer Park, where young African refugees hang out and sell baggies of marijuana—for many newcomers the only work on offer. At each location, Ali and Mo shared stories of activism, police harassment, and efforts to study and find work.

In an essay that appeared in The National Interest at the start of last year, John Mearsheimer, who is perhaps the leading academic proponent of a “realist” approach to international affairs, argued that the United States should restrict its military interventions to areas of “vital strategic interest.” He named three of them: Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf.The use of the term “Persian Gulf” rather than “Middle East” was deliberate. Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, believes that the U.S. government’s main interest in the region, which stretches from the eastern Mediterranean to the Arabian Sea, is insuring that “oil flows freely out of the Gulf, which in practice means preventing any single country from controlling all of that critical resource.” Based on the fact that countries such as Egypt and Syria don’t have any oil, or any aspiration to dominate the Gulf, Mearsheimer argued that what happens within their borders is of limited importance to the United States. “Given that the United States has no vital interests at stake in Egypt and Syria, let alone the capacity for fixing the problems afflicting those countries,” he wrote, “it should adopt a hands-off policy toward them.”In an essay that appeared in The National Interest at the start of last year, John Mearsheimer, who is perhaps the leading academic proponent of a “realist” approach to international affairs, argued that the United States should restrict its military interventions to areas of “vital strategic interest.” He named three of them: Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf.

Earlier this month, a group of nations that call themselves the Vulnerable Twenty held a meeting in Lima. The group, which goes as the V20, comprises countries that have contributed very little to the causes of climate change but are likely to suffer disproportionately from its effects; they include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. In its first communiqué, the V20 called for “urgent and ambitious global climate action.”In the world of climate negotiations, there are many blocs—some of them overlapping—that jostle for influence. These include the Like Minded Developing Countries, or L.M.D.C.s; the Least Developed Countries, or L.D.C.s; the Alliance of Small Island States, or AOSIS; and the Group of 77, or G77, which, confoundingly, has a hundred and thirty-four member countries. The formation of yet another bloc, just a few weeks before world leaders are supposed to meet in Paris to hammer out a global climate accord, did not seem to bode well for an agreement. And, indeed, this week, at a set of pre-Paris talks in Bonn, negotiations took a new and decidedly acrimonious turn.Earlier this month, a group of nations that call themselves the Vulnerable Twenty held a meeting in Lima.

By offering a functional alternative to political violence and social unrest the quartet had helped Tunisians to avoid a civil war.Pope Francis, Secretary of State John Kerry, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those said to be likely to win this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.

The refugee question in Europe is a bit like the gun question in America. It feels good to call each a “crisis” when its consequences fill the headlines, because crisis implies change, and perhaps a resolution. What’s actually taking place is a series of episodes, awful and familiar, each the foreseeable result of a set of policies. When these policies bring about the deaths of innocents—at Columbine and Sandy Hook, Lampedusa and Bodrum—there is a brief window when it seems like the policy might change. For now, that moment is defined by a Syrian toddler, Aylan Kurdi. His parents had fled Kobani and lived as refugees in Turkey. They hoped eventually to join Aylan’s aunt, in Canada. She had written a letter to her member of Parliament  to ask for help, but the process was slow and uncertain, and her brother decided to arrange for a smuggler to carry his family to Greece by clandestine boat.The boat capsized and Aylan drowned, along with his brother, his mother, and eight other refugees. Aylan, neatly dressed in a red polo shirt and rubber-soled shoes, washed up on a Turkish beach, and the image of his drowned body, under the hashtag “KıyıyaVuranİnsanlık,” or “human flotsam,” brought a recognizably human scale to a diffuse problem. The week before, it was seventy-one immigrants who suffocated in a delivery truck on the side of an Austrian highway. Last April, it was the eight hundred who drowned in a single shipwreck off the Libyan coast. Less than two years before, it was more than three hundred and fifty Eritreans who drowned at Lampedusa, within a quarter mile of Italian soil. Soon enough, it will be something else.The refugee question in Europe is a bit like the gun question in America.

Angela Merkel is mean: that seemed to be the story last week. First she was accused of humiliating Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, in negotiations for his country’s third financial bailout in five years.

As Europe’s leaders return home from Brussels, after a marathon negotiating session that kept Greece in the eurozone at great cost to the country’s political sovereignty, the political landscape of the continent looks different, and not a little ominous. In forcing Alexis Tsipras’s government into abject surrender—over the entreaties of some of its neighbors, France in particular—Germany has, for perhaps the first time since reunification, in 1990, blatantly exerted its power on the European stage.Ever since Greek’s leftist Syriza party was elected, in January, on a platform of ending E.U.-imposed austerity policies, it has been pretty obvious that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and Europe’s de-facto leader, held the key to resolving the crisis. Twice in the past few months, first in March, and again last week, I expressed the hope that Merkel would rise above the conservative German economic ideology of “ordoliberalism,” as well as German prejudices against the southern Europeans, to bring about a solution that, while exerting significant concessions from the Greek government, preserved the ideals of commonality and solidarity that underpin the European Union. Tragically, the Chancellor failed to rise to the challenge.As Europe’s leaders return home from Brussels, after a marathon negotiating session that kept Greece in the eurozone at great cost to the country’s political sovereignty, the political landscape of the continent looks different, and not a little ominous.

“The Greek financial nightmare is a reminder of why countries benefit from having their own currencies,” David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post last Tuesday, before the government of Alexis Tsipras grudgingly accepted terms for another bailout. This was “a reminder,” presumably, because there was no need to debate something so axiomatic. “In the old days,” Ignatius continued, “a flexible drachma could have been devalued to boost exports and economic growth.” Economists from Martin Feldstein to Paul Krugman have proposed this cause and effect as a solution to Greece’s crisis since it began, in 2009. Krugman made the point forcefully in his column on Friday, lashing out at European and American austerity hawks and pointing to Canada’s devalued dollar as the reason for its recovery from the 2008 meltdown. “Greece, unfortunately, no longer had its own currency when it was forced into drastic fiscal retrenchment,” Krugman wrote. “The result was an economic implosion that ended up making the debt problem even worse.”There can be no doubt that, in the case of Greece, critics of radical austerity have the better side of the argument. All agree that the Greek economy has to grow at an accelerating rate if the country is to have a chance of meeting a good part of its debt obligations, however generously they are restructured. Krugman notes that the national debt, which was roughly one and a quarter times G.D.P. in 2009, is, after austerity, one and three quarters times that today. Almost a million people, in a country of just over ten million, worked for the government in 2009. You could insist, as advocates of austerity have, that this was unsustainable, but throwing a third of those employees out of work, cutting remaining public-sector salaries by a third, and drastically reducing pensions, as advocates of austerity did, inevitably suppressed local demand. They could not have expected private-sector entrepreneurs to invest in consumer businesses, either. Creditor banks in Germany will almost certainly have to take some losses to get the Greek government’s ledgers back into balance.“The Greek financial nightmare is a reminder of why countries benefit from having their own currencies,” David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post last Tuesday, before the government of Alexis Tsipras grudgingly accepted terms for another bailout.

But before we get onto the outcome of this latest drama, it’s worth pausing to consider the events leading up to it.On Friday, Yanis Varoufakis, the former finance minister of Greece, published an article on the Guardian’s Web site in which he alleged that Germany—or, at least Wolfgang Schäuble, the country’s finance minister—wasn’t interested reaching a deal to keep Greece in the eurozone. “Based on months of negotiation,” Varoufakis, who resigned after last Sunday’s referendum, wrote, “my conviction is that the German finance minister wants Greece to be pushed out of the single currency to put the fear of God into the French and have them accept his model of a disciplinarian eurozone.”As I write this, European leaders are meeting in Brussels, and Greece’s fate in the eurozone remains in the balance.

Until we see the details of the new proposal from Athens, which is due to be delivered to Greece’s European creditors by midnight on Thursday, it is hard to assess the chances of a face-saving deal that would keep the country in the eurozone. The outlines of a possible compromise are already emerging, however. In exchange for Greece promising to introduce more spending cuts and start implementing structural reforms to its economy, the creditors would agree to a new bailout that includes the prospect of debt relief.Until now, the European Union has insisted that debt relief could only be considered after Greece had implemented a series of reforms, which include cutting pensions, reforming the tax system, and liberalizing the labor market. On Thursday morning, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which is comprised of the heads of states of E.U. member governments, broke with this line, saying, “I hope that today we will receive concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens. If this happens, we will also need a parallel proposal from the creditors. The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors.”Until we see the details of the new proposal from Athens, which is due to be delivered to Greece’s European creditors by midnight on Thursday, it is hard to assess the chances of a face-saving deal that would keep the country in the eurozone.

When Greek voters resoundingly rejected, in Sunday’s referendum, the latest proposal from the country’s creditors, it seemed for a moment as if the victory might strengthen the leftist Syriza government’s hand in its negotiations with the rest of Europe. But apparently no one told the Europeans that this was the case. Yesterday, European leaders announced that Greece had until Thursday to present a new bailout proposal and said that unless an agreement was reached by Sunday, the country might well face expulsion from the eurozone. Most of the players in these negotiations, on both sides of the table, say that they want to keep a so-called Grexit from happening: the European Council President, Donald Tusk, said on Tuesday that it would be “the worst-case scenario, where all of us will lose.” So how did we reach a point where an outcome that neither side wants may well be the one that both sides get?For Greece, the fundamental problem is simple: the country has a limited amount of bargaining power, and the referendum had little effect on that fact. Often, owing a huge amount of money can paradoxically give you leverage, since you can threaten to walk away from your debts and leave your creditors with nothing. That’s difficult for Greece because, at the moment, it needs to borrow money just to pay its bills and to keep its banking system intact. This isn’t just, or even primarily, a result of its huge pile of debt. In fact, because of past restructurings that extended the maturity and lowered the interest rate on most of the country’s debt, Greece’s debt-servicing costs are actually relatively low—lower than those of many other European countries. If the Greek economy could manage to grow at even a modest clip, it would have little trouble servicing its debt. The debt itself is fundamental to Greece’s future prospects, as we’ll see, but for all the attention it’s gotten, it’s actually a secondary problem right now.When Greek voters resoundingly rejected, in Sunday’s referendum, the latest proposal from the country’s creditors, it seemed for a moment as if the victory might strengthen the leftist Syriza government’s hand in its negotiations with the rest of Europe.

In any great political crisis, there comes a moment when great leadership is required—the sort of leadership that prioritizes the general good over sectional interests, and that shapes events rather than reacting to them. Following Sunday’s referendum in Greece, the European debt crisis, which is ultimately a political crisis, has reached such a moment. Because of the way the European Union works, only Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, is in a position to preserve not just Greece’s continued membership in the eurozone but the larger vision of an open, democratic, and fraternal Europe that has dominated the continent’s history for the past seventy years.With many of the Chancellor’s colleagues and electors urging her to hold firm, despite the fact that Greece’s banking system is teetering on the edge of collapse, Merkel might be tempted to play it safe, allowing the arguments of the continent’s finance ministries, central bankers, and tabloid newspapers to prevail. It is likely (although by no means certain) that Wolfgang Schäuble, Merkel’s hardline finance minister, is right when he suggests that a Greek exit from the eurozone, even a disorderly one, would not have a major economic impact on the rest of Europe.

For the second time in six months, the Greek public has voted against the austerity policies that were imposed on the country as a result of the international bailouts that took place in 2010 and 2012. In elections held in January, Syriza, the left-wing alliance that promised relief from spending cuts and a recession, won thirty-six per cent of the vote and emerged as the largest party in the Greek parliament. On Sunday, the vote against austerity was even more decisive: in a referendum on whether Greece should accept a recent offer from its creditors, sixty-one per cent of Greeks said, “Oxi”—“No.”The result defied the opinion polls, which had suggested a tight vote, and it was quite overwhelming. Late Sunday night, it appeared that every single electoral district had followed the advice of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and voted “No.” As the numbers came in, Antonis Samaras, the head of the main opposition party, New Democracy, who had urged Greeks to vote “Yes,” resigned. A jubilant Tsipras hailed the results, saying that Greeks had acted bravely and proved democracy cannot be blackmailed. However, Tsipras also stressed that this wasn’t a mandate for rupture with Europe, but rather a vote to strengthen Greece’s negotiating position within the eurozone.For the second time in six months, the Greek public has voted against the austerity policies that were imposed on the country as a result of the international bailouts that took place in 2010 and 2012.

Just when you thought that the Greece saga had run out of plot twists, another one emerged on Thursday—and it was an important one. A few days before a referendum that will probably decide the fate of Greece’s Syriza government, one of the country’s creditors, the International Monetary Fund, came out and acknowledged that the stricken country is unlikely to recover until a good portion of its huge debt load is wiped out.Echoing the argument that Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s controversial finance minister, has been making for months, the I.M.F. published an internal analysis that described Greece’s debt dynamics as “unsustainable.” At a minimum, the analysis said, the maturity dates of Greece’s loans, which total more than three hundred billion euros, “will need to be extended significantly.” And if Greece doesn’t push through all of the structural and fiscal reforms that the Fund believes are necessary, “haircuts on debt will become necessary.” (A “haircut” is the financial term for reducing the face value of outstanding debt. If you owned a $1,000 bond and it was subjected to a haircut of ten per cent, it would entitle you to collect just $900 when it became due.)Just when you thought that the Greece saga had run out of plot twists, another one emerged on Thursday—and it was an important one.

In the past year or so, the U.S. economic situation has improved—job growth has picked up (with the exception of last month), and the number of people without health insurance has continued to fall as the effects of the Affordable Care Act have taken hold. Assuming Clinton wins the nomination, both of these things will make it easier for her to defend President Obama’s legacy, and to point to the potential folly, with things improving, of the economy coming under the tutelage of extremist Republicans.Hillary Clinton’s official announcement that she is running for President comes almost ten months to the day that she set out on a book tour to promote “Hard Choices,” a memoir of her four years as Secretary of State.

Another day, another European summit on Greece.

The European Central Bank was being niggardly about extending any more credit, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch head of the Eurogroup (which consists of euro-zone finance ministers), suggested that Athens might have to impose controls on the movement of capital, which is what Cyprus did in 2013, when it couldn’t make payments on its loans. The E.U.’s tough stance toward Greece was partly a negotiating ploy to force Syriza to be more coöperative, but it also reflected a growing anger at the Greeks, and perhaps even a desire to punish Syriza’s leaders for being too uppity.Another day, another European summit on Greece.

“There just isn’t the political will and the leverage to enforce a ceasefire,” the New Yorker staff writer George Packer says of the war in eastern Ukraine. “Without that reality on the ground, whatever is put on paper—a thirteen-point protocol in Minsk—sounds something like a fantasy of Hollywood. It’s just evanescent.”“There just isn’t the political will and the leverage to enforce a ceasefire,” the New Yorker staff writer George Packer says of the war in eastern Ukraine. “Without that reality on the ground, whatever is put on paper—a thirteen-point protocol in Minsk—sounds something like a fantasy of Hollywood. It’s just evanescent.”
Packer joins fellow-writer Evan Osnos and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week’s episode of the Political Scene podcast to talk about the U.S. and Europe’s ongoing struggle against Vladimir Putin. They discuss Putin’s role in the separatists’ military initiative, the effects of the region’s instability on NATO, Angela Merkel's role as mediator, and the U.S.’s waning ability to keep violence under control. Of Obama, Osnos says, “Clearly he has no interest in seeing Vladimir Putin redefine the boundaries of postwar Europe. At the same time, he’s not willing to expend American blood and treasure to stop it.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Perhaps the most shocking thing about Sunday’s election in Greece, which saw the left-wing Syriza Party emerge with the largest share of seats in parliament, was that something like this took so long to happen. After five years of austerity policies that have plunged much of the euro zone into a deep and grinding recession, parties on the far left and far right have been gaining popularity from the Atlantic to the Adriatic. With public anger rising, it was only a matter of time before one of them won enough votes to take power, and now it has happened. Syriza won a hundred and forty-nine seats in Greece’s parliament, just two short of a majority. On Monday, the party’s forty-year-old leader, Alexis Tsipras, was sworn in as the head of a coalition government that also includes a small right-wing nationalist party.During the election campaign, Tsipras promised to reverse budget-cutting measures and to renegotiate Greece’s huge debts, which, even now, after two bailouts orchestrated jointly by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, come to about a hundred and seventy-five per cent of G.D.P. On Sunday night, after the election result became clear, Tsipras hailed what he described as a historic mandate for change. “Greece will now move ahead with hope and reach out to Europe, and Europe is going to change,” he told a cheering crowd of supporters. “The verdict is clear. We will bring an end to the vicious circle of austerity.”Perhaps the most shocking thing about Sunday’s election in Greece, which saw the left-wing Syriza Party emerge with the largest share of seats in parliament, was that something like this took so long to happen.

Among the many powerful images that circulated the week after the attacks in Paris, one was notable for its absurdity. A photograph, which ran in the Israeli ultra-Orthodox daily newspaper Hamevaser, showed the world’s heads of state, marching arm in arm in solidarity. Or rather, the male heads of state: female leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had been digitally removed from the photo in the name of religious modesty. The move was swiftly condemned. Here was flagrant religious intolerance, in the depiction of an event intended to protest such intolerance. By the next day, spoofs of the doctored image had started to circulate: one removed all the men from the photo; another turned everyone into Merkel.This scrubbing-out was understood to be a pathetic story about a fringe sector taking ridiculous measures to try to preserve its counter-reality. (We had seen this story before. In 2011, the Brooklyn-based newspaper Di Tzeitung was shown to have removed Hillary Clinton and another woman from the historic photo of the White House Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden.) Even within the ultra-Orthodox community, which numbers some eight hundred thousand in Israel, Hamevaser is a niche publication, read by only seven per cent of ultra-Orthodox people, or Haredim. But to laugh off the image, to treat it as a curiosity, would be to disregard a serious fight being waged in Israel over the representation of women in the public sphere.Among the many powerful images that circulated the week after the attacks in Paris, one was notable for its absurdity.

After Thursday’s unexpected and dramatic revaluation, by the Swiss National Bank, of the Swiss franc, the euro fell sharply against the dollar on Friday, at one point dropping below $1.15. Observing the gyrations in the currency markets, it is easy to get alarmed. What do they portend?It means big losses for some individuals and institutions that were on the wrong side of the moves (and big gains for others). For the rest of us, the apparent chaos in the markets contains some good news. Traders and currencies are reacting to a new policy regime, in which the Federal Reserve is moving toward raising interest rates while the European Central Bank embarks on a policy of quantitative easing—i.e., creating large sums of money then used to purchase government bonds and other financial assets—that is designed, in part, to bring down the value of the euro. With the euro-zone economy still chronically depressed, and the U.S. economy expanding at an annual rate of more than four per cent, a substantial devaluation of the euro is precisely what is needed.After Thursday’s unexpected and dramatic revaluation, by the Swiss National Bank, of the Swiss franc, the euro fell sharply against the dollar on Friday, at one point dropping below $1.15.

PEGIDA stands for Patriotische Europäer Gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, and its weekly marches, which began in Dresden, in October, have grown larger—some twenty-five thousand people in Dresden, a few thousand in Leipzig.

Stern called it an act of ""mimicry,"" one that brought PEGIDA more attention and greater crowds than it had previously attracted. The day before, in France, Marine Le Pen, of the right-wing National Front, had only benefitted when President François Hollande, making similar accusations, had clumsily disinvited her from a national unity march that drew millions.

In 2011, just six days after the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine under threat for having run cartoons of the prophet Mohammed, was gutted by a fire bomb, the staff put out a new issue with a cover drawing of a bearded, presumably Muslim man kissing a cartoonist. The caption was “L’amour: Plus fort que la haine,” which translates to “Love: Stronger than hate.” The cartoon was a properly irreverent combination—an affirmation of the most universal truth, a commitment to the magazine's own very particular identity. To be brave, one needn't ever be saccharine. The magazine and its artists, editors, and staff believed in all of that and lived those values, in a way that few of us are ever asked to. At midday this Wednesday, ten of them were killed, along with two Paris policemen who rushed to their aid when what were reportedly two or three hooded men, armed with AK-47s—some of the details are not yet clear—went into the office, in Paris's Eleventh Arrondissement, and started firing, apparently at anyone they could find. In addition to the dead, twenty people were injured, according to French police statements. There is a video in which the gunmen can be heard shouting “Allahu Akbar!”—God is great. This was, as President François Hollande said after rushing to the scene, ""undoubtedly an act of terrorism."" And, though the exact identity of the shooters will need to be determined, in these first hours there are strong signs that it is an act of Islamist terrorism.The dead include Stéphane Charbonnier, who used the pen name Charb and was the very brave editor of Charlie Hebdo; the cartoonists Jean Cabut (who signed his work Cabu), Bernard Verlhac (Tignous), Georges Wolinski, and Philippe Honoré; Mustapha Ourrad, a copy editor; the columnists Bernard Maris and Elsa Cayat; Frédéric Boisseau, described as a building maintenance worker. Ahmed Merabet and Franck Brinsolaro were police officers. Michel Renaud was visiting the office when he was shot dead. (Vox has a list.) They were assassinated. The gunmen were not on a suicide mission; they fled and stole a car, which the latest reports suggest has been located in the Twentieth Arrondissement. (The Guardian and others have live updates; these include video clips of a shoot-out.) The gunmen were still at large in Paris, as of the early afternoon there, and presumably armed. Children were evacuated from schools near the Charlie Hebdo office, which was in the same building as at least one other media organization. Some workers in the building managed to hide from the shooters, but it was, reportedly, a production day at the magazine, busy and crowded. This was an attack on a publication and a neighborhood, a country and its press, and on any journalist, in any city. The magazine made fun of people—of many faiths, for many follies, which we all need to be reminded that we have. Some of the cartoons were blatantly, roughly sexual, and not designed to endear them to Jews or Christians. Satire was Charlie Hebdo’s mission, and a necessary one. There were times when the French government asked the magazine to hold back, but the magazine kept being itself, which is what one wishes for in a free press. Wednesday's crime should not cause anyone to second-guess Charlie Hebdo’s editorial decisions.

But this non-economist might offer some insight into the psychology of the European players who, right now, are so baffling and frightening the punditariat in America. I refer to the French and the Scots, the Auld Alliance, as it’s called, after the—well, old—alliance that brought the late-medieval and early-modern kingdoms of Scotland and France together against the English. (There is still a pub in the Marais, in Paris, with just that name.) Why, we hear, are French politicians so reluctant to put up a fight against Angela Merkel and the politics of austerity, despite the harm they’ve done to the French economy? How can the Scots consider disuniting themselves from the English, when it’s plain that the economic consequences are likely to be disastrous?"

What does character have to do with espionage? That question, as much as any details about handlers and cover names and clandestine meeting spots, is what makes the events that led, this past week, to the expulsion of the C.I.A.’s station chief in Berlin feel like an old spy novel. The beguiling way to look at it is in terms of the character of the spy: the way he acts and his attributes, those he takes on in some undercover operation and those that make one wonder about who he is and where his loyalties really lie—about his own character, in the moral sense. But spy stories also lead us to talk, in ways that are more and less useful, about the character of nations."

By the middle of the second half, it was evident that one goal would settle it, and, in the second period of extra time, Germany nabbed one, thanks to a great piece of finishing by the young striker Mario Götze, who had come on as a substitute."

When he opened it, a postman handed him an official telegram, requesting his presence that afternoon at the university’s personnel office. When Zubov arrived, the school’s vice-rector wordlessly handed him a signed letter: he had been fired, in accordance with Point 8, Article 81 of the state labor code, which covers the “commission of an immoral act incompatible with the continuation of work.” The statute is usually applied to instructors who show up to lecture while drunk, for example, or who harass female students."

The Moscow stock market fell sharply on Friday, following the announcement that the United States and the European Union had expanded financial sanctions directed at Vladimir Putin’s political and business associates. Meanwhile, the credit-rating agency Fitch joined its rival, Standard & Poors, in downgrading Russia’s sovereign debt. With a rating of BBB, Russian government bonds are still regarded as investment-grade securities, but only just—and their yields jumped sharply in Friday’s trading, reaching almost 9.5 per cent. That means Putin’s government is already paying a modest price for its annexation of Crimea: since the start of the crisis, its borrowing costs have risen by about one per cent."

With the Moscow stock market down by more than ten per cent, and the ruble hitting a historic low, the Western effort to make Vladimir Putin pay for sending Russian troops into Crimea is under way. Speaking from Kiev on Monday, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, repeated the Obama Administration’s message to Putin, saying that Russia will face “significant diplomatic and economic costs” unless it reverses course."

What is happening in the Crimean Peninsula is not a war, exactly—or not if bloodshed is the standard for war. It is an ominous, creeping occupation (for now) of a region of sovereign Ukraine by the Russian armed forces at the order of the Kremlin. So far there have been no casualties, almost no shooting. In the predominantly pro-Russian Crimea, the Russian servicemen are generally welcomed by the local inhabitants. As Russian troops encircle and block Ukrainian military units in Crimea, the Ukrainian government in Kiev, the capital, is preparing for resistance. What will come next—full-blown war, negotiations, or a prolonged standoff—is anyone’s guess."

Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty.It’s 2013, and the Obama Administration has more than three years left to run. We haven’t even had the midterms yet. Mark Halperin and John Heilemann just put out their tell-all about the 2012 campaign. Give us a break.
It’s only twelve months since Hillary stepped down as Secretary of State. At that point, she’d been in the public eye, pretty much constantly, for more than twenty years. Doubtless, she’s enjoying the hiatus. So are we.
The folks running the Ready for Hillary campaign sound a bit annoying. They have their own Web site, T-shirts, fund-raising organization, and cardboard cut-out of their heroine, which they carry around to events. “We’re not creating the support for her,” Seth Bringman, the campaign’s communications director insisted to the Molly Ball, of the Atlantic, who posted a funny report about a Ready for Hillary event in D.C. “The support for her is out there. We’re harnessing it.”
In promoting the narrative that Hillary is the inevitable Democratic candidate for 2016, the Ready for Hillary campaign smacks of an effort to dissuade others from running. In the interest of democratic participation (and a better story to write about), let’s hope that Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Jerry Brown aren’t listening. The same goes for Martin O’Malley, Andrew Cuomo, and any other blue-state hopefuls. Nobody should be anointed their party’s Presidential candidate three years before the election, not even Hillary. Despite her high approval rating, she’s still a polarizing figure. Her 2008 campaign lacked a unifying theme. As Secretary of State, she clocked up a lot of air miles, but her list of lasting achievements wasn’t particularly long. Rather than easing her way to the 2016 nomination, let’s let her slug it out with everybody else.
Perhaps it doesn’t matter very much, but when a two-term President from either party approaches the end of his tenure, it’s not normal etiquette for former cabinet ministers to challenge the sitting Vice-President. George Shultz didn’t take on George H. W. Bush in 1988, and Bill Richardson didn’t confront Al Gore in 2000. Some people associated with the Clintons seem to be trying to bounce Biden out of the race before he gets into it. That’s not very collegial.
Americans may be ready for Hillary, but are they prepared for four (and possibly eight) more years of Bill? Since leaving center stage and focussing on good deeds, the forty-second President has become a beloved elder statesman operating endearingly on the margins. If he returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he would once again be ubiquitous. Before signing on for that prospect, Democratic-primary voters need more time to discuss it with their spouses, and their therapists.
What happens if I go to the Ready for Hillary Web site and buy my wife a sixty-dollar Ready for Hillary tote bag for a holiday present and buy my kids two thirty-eight-dollar Ready for Hillary hoodies, and then she doesn’t run? Can I get a refund?
We should all be ready for a woman in the White House, and Hillary may well be the strongest candidate on the Democratic side. But she’s hardly the only woman who could mount a formidable campaign. There’s Warren, the liberal standard bearer; Senator Patty Murray, who just did a budget deal, and who has a bit of Angela Merkel about her; and Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook honcho and best-selling author. As my colleague Amy Davidson pointed out a while back, “Declaring that Hillary is the only woman with a chance is a denial of the promise of any number of other, emerging women politicians.”
John Podesta, the Bill Clinton alum who is widely expected to run Hillary’s campaign, just took a job at the White House, where he will serve as a senior adviser to President Obama. If Podesta can wait another eighteen months before jumping onto into action for 2016, surely the rest of us can afford a similar time-out.

This was the year that Twitter went public. It was the year that the Justice Department negotiated a thirteen-billion-dollar settlement with JPMorgan over mortgage bonds, the government’s biggest such deal ever. And it was the year that Detroit became the biggest U.S. city to go bankrupt. And yet the developments of 2013 that seem likeliest to have a long-lasting impact are the ones that involved not a single, high-profile company but the entire global economy. By that measure, here are five of the most important business developments of 2013, in no particular order."

In an effort to gin up a bit of publicity for its annual choice for “Person of the Year,” Time has released its list of ten finalists. They include Pope Francis, President Obama, Jeff Bezos, Miley Cyrus, Ted Cruz, and two Middle Eastern leaders: Bashar al-Assad, the embattled President of Syria, and Hassan Rouhani, the new President of Iran. Of these, Pope Francis is by far the strongest candidate, but even the radical new Pontiff can’t compete with another troublemaker on the list: Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who is currently residing somewhere in Russia as the guest of Vladimir Putin, Time’s 2007 honoree."

In 1982, the decision analysts Marc Alpert and Howard Raiffa asked students in their classes at Harvard to estimate figures like the number of eggs produced daily in the United States. They were each asked to give a range so wide that they believed there was a ninety-eight-per-cent chance it would include the right answer. Instead, the correct figures fell inside the students’ ranges less than a third of the time."

In April, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, persuaded members of her political party, the Christian Democratic Union, to defeat a measure in Parliament which would have mandated that twenty per cent of public companies’ supervisory boards be comprised of women by 2018; that proportion would have risen to forty per cent by 2023. Merkel has long opposed such quotas, which are popular elsewhere in Europe. At the time, parliamentary elections were approaching, and Merkel appeased a dissenting bloc of her party—which wanted the reforms—by agreeing to write a gender quota into the party’s election program."

The database of metadata that the N.S.A. has compiled from the phone records of American citizens, Ryan Lizza says, “is probably the most controversial program that’s been disclosed” by Edward Snowden. Now, though, there are revelations that have raised international concerns about the N.S.A.’s surveillance work: that it monitored the phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of other allies. “It’s spied on some of its allies more than others,” Steve Coll says. “And the French and the Germans have been in that category since the Cold War.” On this week’s Political Scene podcast, Lizza and Coll talk with host Dorothy Wickenden about the ongoing N.S.A. spying scandal."

The news that the National Security Agency was monitoring the telephones of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and many other foreign leaders is less shocking than the revelation that, for the first four and a half years of his Presidency, Barack Obama, the Commander-in-Chief, didn’t know anything about it. Can this be true?"

It has become painfully clear that what the National Security Agency lacks, above all, is discretion. That probably occurred to President Obama on Wednesday, when he got on the line with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, who was calling with what was apparently unmitigated anger to ask why the N.S.A. was monitoring her cell phone. Obama told her that it isn’t, or won’t—a “wasn’t” seems to have been missing—but Merkel’s government had seen enough, in N.S.A. documents obtained by the German news magazine Der Spiegel, to know what it thought. (According to Reuters, one listed her mobile phone number.) Obama had a similar call with France’s François Hollande, and may have about thirty-three more, based on the latest Guardian report on the number of heads of state whose phones it tracked. But the N.S.A.’s wildly indiscreet character had already come well into the light in the first documents leaked, this summer, by Edward Snowden, about its mass, often indiscriminate collection of American telephone and Web communications. The Agency moves broadly and clumsily; it’s greedy in a way that is unhealthy; it tells itself that rules can mean what it wants them to mean; it is a poor judge of people; it has no real discernment—and that, for a spy agency, may be the worst part of all."

Angela Merkel, who was reëlected earlier this month to a third term as Germany’s chancellor, isn’t the only woman who fared well in the recent election: voters raised the percentage of women in the German parliament from thirty-three to thirty-six per cent. Another recent development for women in Germany has been less publicized, though, and may come as a surprise given the high-profile successes of women in politics. In recent months, four of the country’s best-known female executives left their positions—some by choice and others not."

“Take hold of the frying pan, dust pan, and broom, and marry a man.” Sounds like something from the conservative Mommy blogs that your favorite feminists rebuke on Twitter, no? Actually, it’s one of the Nazi leader Hermann Goering’s “Nine Commandments for the Workers’ Struggle,” published and posted throughout Germany in 1934. Wading anew into the Mommy Wars, and on the heels of the back-to-school season, is an item just discovered in the stacks of Germany’s Federal Archive: a rule book for the Reichsbräuteschule, or Reich Bride School, set up by the Nazis “to mould housewives out of office girls.”"

Just a few hours after celebrating her election to a third term as Germany’s Chancellor by dancing to “Days Like These,” an anthemic song by the German punk band Die Toten Hosen, Angela Merkel was back to her usual self on Monday morning: low-key, deliberate, and schoolmarmish. “Thoroughness goes before speed,” she said in answer to questions about how long it would take her to form a new administration, which will probably include representatives of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), as well as her own party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union. “Germany needs a stable government, and we will fulfill this task.”"
