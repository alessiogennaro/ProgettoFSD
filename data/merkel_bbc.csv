Germans vote on Sunday in elections that will ultimately bring down the curtain on Angela Merkel's final term as chancellor of Germany.
When Mrs Merkel steps down after 16 years in power, how will history remember her?
We asked four experts to assess her style of leadership and track record.
She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, says Matt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University, and author of Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader.
German politics used to be a testosterone-fuelled Männerclub - a club of men. Under Mrs Merkel, things have become much more policy-oriented.
The problem with that, I suppose, is that it ends up being quite mechanical and scientific. Mrs Merkel trained as a physicist, and has a PhD in quantum chemistry. So, for someone like her, she has an approach that is very factually based.
That's not the sort of thing that is barnstorming. But in her own sort of way, she has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally.
At a time when politics has become more polarised, she's tried to depolarise them by depoliticising issues.
Charlotte Galpin: Senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham
Mrs Merkel has been proclaimed by Forbes as the most powerful woman in the world for 10 years running. There is a whole generation in Germany that has never known anything other than a woman leader.
Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, and she is known for bringing women into key positions. For example, she supported Ursula von der Leyen, the first female German defence minister and European Commission president.
Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community.
The targeting of Muslim women and rallying against so-called gender madness is widespread in Germany, driven in part but not only by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. This election cycle, the issue of gender-appropriate language has become a politicised issue, over which Mrs Merkel has stayed largely silent.
Dr Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck: Professor of political science and political sociology at the University of Mannheim
Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness.
Many of the modernising features - such as same-sex marriage, phasing out nuclear energy, and welcoming immigration policies - would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor.
However, the country is almost grotesquely lagging behind on big, pressing issues like digitalisation, climate policy, and demographic change.
As Angela Merkel leaves office, the political landscape is much more volatile. This concerns, in part, the increasingly complex party system and the AfD, which thrives on anti-immigration sentiment.
There is, of course, the simple fact that she was the country's first female chancellor. I'm sure her pragmatic, quasi-presidential style of governing will serve as a role model for her successor, whoever it may be.
Dr Katrin Schreiter: Lecturer in German and European studies at King's College London
Her legacy is a determined and silent one. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. She's always been criticised for not being a visionary. But voters knew what they were getting with her.
She is brilliant at reading the room and taking the temperature of the electorate. For that, she has earned a lot of trust from international partners.
The other legacy that she leaves is that she liberalised the agenda of her party, the conservative Christian Democrats. She has moved the conservatives closer to the centre, and also closer to the left-wing Greens in certain aspects.
Matt Qvortrup: Her main legacy is rescuing the euro, and dealing with the financial crisis of 2008.
I remember talking to her in Brussels at the time. In response to the crisis, she said she wanted as much market economics as possible, but as much state intervention as necessary.
The German Social Democrats used that line as a slogan in the 1960s. When I put that to her, she said, ""I'm not a historian, I'm a pragmatist"".
The second moment was her response to the Trump years. She kept the powder dry for liberal internationalism. Former US President Barack Obama actually convinced her to run for a fourth term. Immediately after Trump won the election, Mr Obama flew to Berlin to meet with Mrs Merkel.
After the meeting, Mr Obama recounted that he saw a tear in her eye. She was all alone.
She kept the ship afloat and, in a way, she's now done her duty. She can go.
Charlotte Galpin: Mrs Merkel's tenure is usually described as one characterised by crises.
A key moment was the refugee crisis. Facing a humanitarian crisis in the Balkans, Mrs Merkel opened Germany's borders and accepted almost a million refugees during 2015 proclaiming ""wir schaffen das"" - we can manage this.
Germany stood out as one of the few European countries that gave refuge to Syrians fleeing the civil war. Yet, 2015 saw the AfD move from an economically liberal, anti-Euro party to a far-right, Islamophobic one.
The AfD's success in the last Bundestag election saw the country's first far-right MPs since the 1960s.
Dr Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck: Three [moments] in particular come to mind.
First, when Mrs Merkel and her finance minister addressed citizens in 2008 to assure them that the government would guarantee their savings, to prevent a much-dreaded bank run.
Second, the high-stakes EU negotiations about debt relief for Greece during the Euro crisis.
And finally, Mrs Merkel's decision not to close the border to refugees stranded in Hungary in 2015. One should not overlook that Mrs Merkel did not open the border, as this decision is often framed, but decided not to close it.
Dr Katrin Schreiter: One of them was in 2017, when she paved the way for same-sex marriage to go through parliament.
Shortly before the election, she gave an interview to a women's magazine. In it, she said voting on these issues was a matter of individual conscience. She basically broke the party line and that opened up the opportunity to pass that law after years of delay. That was a major achievement.
One of my favourite quotes is an early one. Once, when asked about what she felt when thinking of Germany, she said: ""I think of well-sealed windows. No other country can make such well-sealed and nice windows.""
That shows her humility and pragmatism. She broke it down to something very practical. That encapsulates it for me.

As one of the world's most influential leaders, Angela Merkel has helped to determine the course of European and global politics. But during her 16 years as German chancellor, she's also had a considerable impact on her own country, shaping the lives of millions of citizens for better or worse.
Among them, the students who celebrated the end of their school days this summer.
At one prom in Berlin, excited teenagers in smart jackets and formal dresses danced to a thudding bass in a marquee. The class of 2021 has come of age in Mrs Merkel's Germany; they have never known another German leader.
""We don't have a perfect democracy,"" says Ole Schroeder, ""but I think we have a good democracy.""
""Germany is good with the immigration system,"" adds Alisa Gukasov. ""Everyone has the chance to live here and to achieve their dreams.""
But they worry about the future.
Lina Ziethen's main concern is climate change. ""We have to stand up and say stop driving cars, stop flying on holiday because we need to reduce emissions - but we should have also already done this 50 years ago, not just now.""
It is on the minds of many Germans, not least because of this summer's deadly floods in the west of the country.
Under Mrs Merkel, Germany has reduced emissions and invested in renewables.
But it's widely acknowledged that current targets aren't strict enough; and Germany is still burning coal, in part because Mrs Merkel abandoned nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan 10 years ago.
If you wander through the fairy-tale forests that carpet so much of this country, you can see the damage wrought by climate change.
The Borkenkäfer, a beetle that bores into trees and destroys them, is proliferating in warmer, drier conditions.
The trees' natural defences are weakened too. Hans Schattenberg, who manages the forests of the eastern Harz region, says all he and his staff can do is cut down acres of woodland to try to halt the spread.
""We never thought the forest would react so quickly to climate change,"" he says. ""'What shocked us most is that it wasn't just the conifers that were badly affected, but also old oak and beech trees.""
Old certainties are shifting here.
Under Mrs Merkel, Germany has prospered, though her predecessors must take some of the credit for the wealth of today. And critics worry that, as competitors move ahead with technological and digital advances, this economic giant is struggling to keep up.
German elections 2021
Germans vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday 26 September.
Mrs Merkel's conservative CDU has led coalitions for four terms, but the latest opinion polls suggest the centre-left is on course to win.
As glass bottles rattle along the production line, Anke Ketterer surveys Germany's best-loved export.
Her family have been brewing beer since 1877; one of the so-called Mittelstand (family firms) responsible for much of this country's economic success.
These have been good years, she says, and Angela Merkel has done a good job.
""We don't really have much to complain about,"" adds her husband Phillip, who took her surname when he married into the family business. The Mittelstand could, he says, do with more support and less bureaucracy.
""We are doing well in Germany. But, of course, the danger is you feel too content and stagnate and fall behind.""
Perhaps Mrs Merkel's greatest influence can be seen in German society. Her refusal to close the doors to hundreds of thousands of people seeking asylum in the country in 2015 was a pivotal moment in her chancellorship.
Germany has long relied on migrants to fill jobs, keep the economy going and rejuvenate an ageing population - ever since the Turkish ""Gastarbeiter"" who came to help rebuild the country after World War Two.
Today more than a quarter of people living in Germany have a migrant background.
Among them is Negin, who arrived from Iran as a teenage asylum seeker and told us she nearly drowned as she crossed the Mediterranean in a small, overcrowded boat.
Today, she's an apprentice at a Berlin dental practice and, in fluent German, says she plans to become a dentist herself.
Mrs Merkel famously told Germany ""Wir schaffen das"" (we can do it) during the so-called migrant crisis. Six years later, many would agree she was right. The sense of crisis has long passed.
But some Germans - a minority - are still furious. They point to migrant crime and terror attacks.
A far-right anti-migrant party, the AfD, now sits in the national parliament. Fuelled by lingering resentment that is particularly strong in the former communist East.
When the Iron Curtain fell, people in the East were promised blooming landscapes. But 30 years on opportunities are fewer, and salaries and pensions lower than in the rest of the country. It's hard to convince young people to stay.
In their typical German Schrebergarten (allotment garden) Hannelore and her friends say they thought Mrs Merkel would do more for the former East. After all, the chancellor herself grew up behind the Iron Curtain.
Disillusioned with Germany's long-established political parties, they vote AfD.
""Since 2015 when the migrants came marching in uncontrolled, since then it has gone downhill for Germany,"" says Hannelore.
Inequalities persist in today's Germany.
Mrs Merkel's critics, for example, say she could have done more to address the gender pay gap, one of the worst in Europe, or encourage more women into leading positions in business and politics.
""She did try,"" says Daniela Schwarzer from the Open Society Foundation. Like many here, she believes that by simply occupying Germany's top job, Mrs Merkel has been a powerful role model to younger women.
She cites her support for Germany's current Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was once in the running to succeed her as chancellor.
""When you hear about how she actually managed the chancellery, there were women in key positions, and she was actually surrounded by women as her closest advisers.""
And Mrs Merkel remains a popular figure in the country she's led for so long.
""In the long run people will see that these 16 years, if you sum it up, were quite successful, not only economically, but also in shaping the country towards preparing it for a future which will not be easy,"" says Professor Magnus Brechtken from Munich's Institute of Contemporary History.
Her legacy is to have represented ""rational, pragmatic solution-orientated"" thinking, in a world he sees as more shaped by people who have taken an approach that is either national, irrational, narcissistic or populist.
At a casual glance, the world of German politics can look rather boring. It's all about compromise, consensus and continuity.

Double-jabbed people should be able to travel from the UK to Germany without quarantining ""in the foreseeable future"", Angela Merkel has said.
The German chancellor said her country was ""continuously reviewing"" its Covid travel restrictions, after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Mr Johnson said he thought progress was being made on the issue.
Mrs Merkel is visiting the UK in her final official trip as chancellor.
In a press conference following their talks at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, the two leaders spoke about trade and post-Brexit relations.
The chancellor was then asked when Britons who have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine should expect to be able to travel to Germany.
She said Germany had adopted restrictions in response to the Delta variant, which she said was now spreading ""very rapidly"" in her country.
""But as you know we are reviewing continuously our travel restrictions and we think that in the foreseeable future those who have received double jabs will then, according to our classification - and now Britain obviously is a high incidence area - will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine,"" she said.
""At the beginning we didn't have much experience with this variant but we're dealing with it,"" she added.
""And that is a continuous learning process... we have to adjust time and again to the most recent developments.""
Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, also met the Queen at Windsor Castle.
And she addressed a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting was a virtual one.
Mrs Merkel's comments about travel mark a change in tone.
Last week said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant, which was first identified in India.
Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany, aside from a few limited exceptions. Those who are allowed in from the UK must quarantine for 14 days.
However, Mrs Merkel did express ""grave concern"" about the numbers of football fans attending Euro 2020 matches at Wembley Stadium, and said she had outlined this during their talks.
""We in Germany, as you know, have less people attend games in the Munich stadium but the British government will obviously take its own decision,"" she said.
""But I am very much concerned whether it is not a bit too much.""
Mr Johnson said sporting events were being opened up in a ""very careful and controlled manner"" and that vaccinations had built up a ""very considerable wall of immunity"" in the UK.
He is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda.
The talks follow reports that the European Union's passport scheme does not recognise doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India known as Covishield.
Mr Johnson said during the press conference he was ""very confident"" that there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received these jabs.
On Friday, the UK recorded 27,125 new Covid cases and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.
More than 85% of UK adults have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and more than 63% are fully vaccinated, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.Double-jabbed people should be able to travel from the UK to Germany without quarantining ""in the foreseeable future"", Angela Merkel has said.
The German chancellor said her country was ""continuously reviewing"" its Covid travel restrictions, after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Mr Johnson said he thought progress was being made on the issue.
Mrs Merkel is visiting the UK in her final official trip as chancellor.
In a press conference following their talks at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, the two leaders spoke about trade and post-Brexit relations.
The chancellor was then asked when Britons who have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine should expect to be able to travel to Germany.
She said Germany had adopted restrictions in response to the Delta variant, which she said was now spreading ""very rapidly"" in her country.
""But as you know we are reviewing continuously our travel restrictions and we think that in the foreseeable future those who have received double jabs will then, according to our classification - and now Britain obviously is a high incidence area - will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine,"" she said.

She was speaking following talks in Dublin with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) about the current deadlock.
Parliament is still no closer to passing a Brexit deal, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April.
Ms Merkel was asked if it was possible to protect the integrity of the single market without an Irish border being in place.

Ms Merkel said they hoped intensive ongoing discussions in London would lead to a situation by next Wednesday ""where Prime Minister Theresa May will have something to table to us on the basis of which we can continue to talk"".
She added: ""Until the very last hour - I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union.
""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us.""

Germany faces a period of political uncertainty after the Social Democrats (SPD) won a tight general election, paving the way for talks to form a new coalition government.
The centre-left SPD came first with 25.7% of the vote, followed by the conservative alliance (CDU) of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel on 24.1% - its worst result ever.
The two main rivals to succeed Merkel, the SPD's Olaf Scholz and CDU leader Armin Laschet, have both claimed a mandate to lead the next coalition government.
The leaders of Germany's political parties met on Monday to kick off coalition negotiations that could take months.
Here is a quick guide to who they are, with an assessment of the chances they have of taking power.
Like Armin Laschet, Olaf Scholz, 62, has had a succession of senior posts in German politics. He is currently German finance minister and Chancellor Merkel's deputy.
Unlike Mr Laschet, his chances of becoming chancellor soared during the election campaign. He is seen as a safe pair of hands, having first served as an MP from 1998 to 2011.
After a successful stint as mayor of Hamburg (2011-2018), when he rebalanced the city's troubled finances, he returned to the Bundestag.
He hails from Osnabrück in north-western Germany and entered politics as a Socialist Youth leader, having studied labour law. In SPD ranks he is seen as a conservative. He and his wife, Britta Ernst, do not have children.
He has overseen the emergency €750bn (£647bn; $904bn) funding package put together by the federal government to help German businesses and workers survive the pandemic.
""This is the bazooka that's needed to get the job done,"" he said. He is generally seen to have performed well in the pandemic, which has strained German finances and businesses.
His stolid, unflashy demeanour gave rise to the unflattering nickname ""Scholz-o-mat"" - but that image of reliability has struck a chord with risk-averse Germans seeking a continuation of the stability of the Merkel era.
What are his chances?
Mr Scholz and his SPD party are in pole position to lead the next government. As the party with the largest share of the vote (25.7%), it argues that it has the biggest mandate.
On Monday, Mr Scholz said the results showed voters wanted a change. ""I think that the people in Germany want the Christian Democratic Union in opposition,"" he said.
Convincing his favoured coalition partners - the Greens and the FDP - won't be easy though. While they're aligned on some issues, they both have different policy priorities that will need addressing in coalition talks.
He was the front runner but then his campaign faltered, mostly as a result of his own unforced errors.
Mr Laschet, 60, is the leader of Chancellor Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and premier of heavily industrial North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state.
He only narrowly secured the nomination to be the candidate for chancellor, defeating his Bavarian rival, Markus Söder, after the party leadership rallied behind him.
Support for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, was already waning because of the pandemic. Mr Laschet himself was accused of inconsistencies and poor management of Covid-19 in NRW.
And then in July Mr Laschet was caught on camera laughing as the president of Germany made a speech in a town which had been largely destroyed by catastrophic flooding. His reputation was badly damaged and he struggled to recover in the opinion polls.
The son of a miner, and a lawyer by training, for years Mr Laschet defended Germany's powerful coal industry. He has stood by the decision not to bring forward the end of using coal for energy from 2038.
He is well-connected internationally and is firmly pro-EU: he served as a Euro MP and hails from Aachen, a border city with strong French ties.
In 2005 he became minister for integration in his home region, the first such post in Germany, and forged strong ties with its large ethnic Turkish community. He firmly backed Mrs Merkel's lenient but controversial policy on immigration in 2015, when more than a million migrants reached Germany.
The Catholic Church was a strong influence on him as a boy, through his devout parents and his Church-run school. He is married, with three adult children.
What are his chances?
The disappointing result has left Mr Laschet fighting for his political life. In the coming days, expect fiery debate about who or what is to blame for the CDU/CSU's worst result in history.
In the meantime, Mr Laschet has vowed to remain leader of the conservatives and ""do everything we can"" to lead the next government. In theory, he could still become the next chancellor if he persuades smaller parties to partner with him.
A government led by a party that does not have the most seats in the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament - is not without precedent. It has happened before - but by convention, the biggest party has right of way.
For now, Mr Laschet's future hinges on the outcome of coalition talks.
The only woman in the race to succeed Angela Merkel, she is the Greens' first-ever candidate for chancellor.
A former trampoline champion from a village outside the northern city of Hanover, Ms Baerbock, 40, studied law and politics in Hamburg and London and worked for the Greens in the European Parliament.
Earlier this year, the Greens surged in the polls, with support rising above 25% and a focus on Ms Baerbock. However, her reputation was tarnished when she was accused of plagiarism and padding her CV.
She has been an MP in the Bundestag since 2013, and as a mother of two young daughters has campaigned strongly on family issues as well as the environment. She advocates a tougher stance towards both China and Russia than either the CDU/CSU or the Social Democrats.
Ms Baerbock has never held a ministerial post, but argues that she is therefore untainted by German ""status quo"" politics, which she wants to transform.
Ms Baerbock and her co-leader Robert Habeck have a reputation for enforcing discipline in a party with a history of splits between centrists and radicals.
What are her chances?
Preliminary results showed the Greens won considerably fewer votes than the SPD or the CDU/CSU alliance, which have stronger mandates to govern.
For that reason, Ms Baerbock probably won't be the next chancellor, but her party is well on track to enter the next coalition government.
The results suggested climate change was a key issue for German voters, giving a clear boost to the Greens.
In a post-election debate on Sunday, Ms Baerbock said she had a clear mandate to push a climate agenda in the next government. The Greens said they would be open to talks with all parties with a stake.
While the result of Sunday's election was not decisive, we know Germany's next government will be a coalition. It will involve either the CDU/CSU or the Social Democrats, and very possibly the Greens, but there are three other parties in the mix.
Although the Social Democrats won the most votes, they will seek the support of the pro-business FDP to govern.
In 2017, the FDP walked out of coalition talks with the CDU/CSU and Greens, saying ""it is better not to rule than to rule badly"".
This time, the FDP won 11.5% of the vote in preliminary results. Its candidate for chancellor is Christian Lindner, 42.
He joined the party in 1995 and became an MP in 2009. He studied political science at Bonn University and is a reserve officer in the armed forces.
In the pandemic he has sharply criticised the lockdown restrictions, saying they ought to be more tightly targeted, accompanied by more efficient testing. Poor crisis management, he said, had changed Germany's image from ""efficiency superstar"" to ""bureaucratic monster"".
His slogan is to make Germany ""more modern, more digital and freer"". The FDP wants lower taxes and more emphasis on individual initiative.
What are its chances? The FDP feels its moment may have come. The self-confident Mr Lindner overplayed his hand four years ago, and was accused of shirking responsibility when he flounced out of coalition talks.
Since then he has managed to re-establish the FDP's traditional reputation as a modernising force, keen to rein in Germany's ever-expanding bureaucracy. As such, the party potentially has the ability to work with either centre-left or centre-right parties. If Mr Lindner manages to keep his cool this time, the party could rediscover its long-standing role as coalition kingmaker.
The anti-immigration AfD was elected to the Bundestag for the first time in 2017, winning almost 13% of the vote. Riding a wave of voter frustration and anger over the migrant crisis, it became the main opposition party and now has 91 seats.
Its share of the vote sagged to 10.3% in Sunday's election. Its two leading candidates were Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla.
The AfD is hostile to the EU and sees Islam as a threat to German culture and traditions. Even before Covid, the party's support was shrinking, as voter concerns about immigration receded.
The AfD has been in the news for rejecting Covid restrictions and holding a party conference face to face, not remotely. Many in the party see the restrictions as a gross violation of personal liberty. Party leaders have called for an end to lockdown measures and compulsory masking.
It is also calling for Germany to leave the EU and for the return of border controls, including physical measures such as fences.
What are its chances?
The AfD won't enter government, that's for sure. Its nativist rhetoric makes the party toxic to most Germans - its election slogan, ""Germany, but normal"", implies minorities don't belong.
All other parties have ruled out going into coalition with the AfD.
The party was formed out of the remnants of the old East German socialist party and disaffected left-wingers who left the SPD in the mid-noughties.
Its main candidates were Janine Wissler and Dietmar Bartsch.
The party campaigned for increases in pensions and the minimum wage and an end to the system that cuts benefits for the long-term unemployed. It also wants to withdraw all German soldiers from international military missions.
Although Die Linke has its share of anti-capitalist radicals, it also leads a state government in Thuringia. Bodo Ramelow has been premier of the eastern state since 2014.
Die Linke was being talked about as part of a possible coalition. But the party performed poorly in this election, winning only 4.9% of the vote nationally.
What are its chances?
Die Linke has no chance of putting forward a chancellor, nor is it likely to feature in coalition talks. The party only just managed to enter parliament by winning three constituency seats, even though its vote share was below the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.
The party's anti-Nato stance would also be a major stumbling block in coalition talks.Germany faces a period of political uncertainty after the Social Democrats (SPD) won a tight general election, paving the way for talks to form a new coalition government.
The centre-left SPD came first with 25.7% of the vote, followed by the conservative alliance (CDU) of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel on 24.1% - its worst result ever.
The two main rivals to succeed Merkel, the SPD's Olaf Scholz and CDU leader Armin Laschet, have both claimed a mandate to lead the next coalition government.
The leaders of Germany's political parties met on Monday to kick off coalition negotiations that could take months.
Here is a quick guide to who they are, with an assessment of the chances they have of taking power.
Like Armin Laschet, Olaf Scholz, 62, has had a succession of senior posts in German politics. He is currently German finance minister and Chancellor Merkel's deputy.
Unlike Mr Laschet, his chances of becoming chancellor soared during the election campaign. He is seen as a safe pair of hands, having first served as an MP from 1998 to 2011.
After a successful stint as mayor of Hamburg (2011-2018), when he rebalanced the city's troubled finances, he returned to the Bundestag.
He hails from Osnabrück in north-western Germany and entered politics as a Socialist Youth leader, having studied labour law. In SPD ranks he is seen as a conservative. He and his wife, Britta Ernst, do not have children.
He has overseen the emergency €750bn (£647bn; $904bn) funding package put together by the federal government to help German businesses and workers survive the pandemic.
""This is the bazooka that's needed to get the job done,"" he said. He is generally seen to have performed well in the pandemic, which has strained German finances and businesses.
His stolid, unflashy demeanour gave rise to the unflattering nickname ""Scholz-o-mat"" - but that image of reliability has struck a chord with risk-averse Germans seeking a continuation of the stability of the Merkel era.
What are his chances?
Mr Scholz and his SPD party are in pole position to lead the next government. As the party with the largest share of the vote (25.7%), it argues that it has the biggest mandate.
On Monday, Mr Scholz said the results showed voters wanted a change. ""I think that the people in Germany want the Christian Democratic Union in opposition,"" he said.
Convincing his favoured coalition partners - the Greens and the FDP - won't be easy though. While they're aligned on some issues, they both have different policy priorities that will need addressing in coalition talks.
He was the front runner but then his campaign faltered, mostly as a result of his own unforced errors.
Mr Laschet, 60, is the leader of Chancellor Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and premier of heavily industrial North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state.
He only narrowly secured the nomination to be the candidate for chancellor, defeating his Bavarian rival, Markus Söder, after the party leadership rallied behind him.
Support for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, was already waning because of the pandemic. Mr Laschet himself was accused of inconsistencies and poor management of Covid-19 in NRW.
And then in July Mr Laschet was caught on camera laughing as the president of Germany made a speech in a town which had been largely destroyed by catastrophic flooding. His reputation was badly damaged and he struggled to recover in the opinion polls.
The son of a miner, and a lawyer by training, for years Mr Laschet defended Germany's powerful coal industry. He has stood by the decision not to bring forward the end of using coal for energy from 2038.
He is well-connected internationally and is firmly pro-EU: he served as a Euro MP and hails from Aachen, a border city with strong French ties.
In 2005 he became minister for integration in his home region, the first such post in Germany, and forged strong ties with its large ethnic Turkish community. He firmly backed Mrs Merkel's lenient but controversial policy on immigration in 2015, when more than a million migrants reached Germany.
The Catholic Church was a strong influence on him as a boy, through his devout parents and his Church-run school. He is married, with three adult children.
What are his chances?
The disappointing result has left Mr Laschet fighting for his political life. In the coming days, expect fiery debate about who or what is to blame for the CDU/CSU's worst result in history.
In the meantime, Mr Laschet has vowed to remain leader of the conservatives and ""do everything we can"" to lead the next government. In theory, he could still become the next chancellor if he persuades smaller parties to partner with him.
A government led by a party that does not have the most seats in the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament - is not without precedent. It has happened before - but by convention, the biggest party has right of way.
For now, Mr Laschet's future hinges on the outcome of coalition talks.

She had given her party its best result in 20 years. One German paper declared: ""Germany is now conclusively Angela Merkel territory."" In terms of power, Frau Europa has no equals on the continent.
Her victory was, at root, a vote of thanks for her calm steady leadership through the eurozone crisis.
The woman who is often referred to as ""Mutti"" - ""Mummy"" -  had acted as a protector of German interests. She had saved the German tax-payer from becoming the paymaster for the rest of Europe.
Under her leadership eurozone countries which embraced reforms were rescued, but she resisted moves to turn the European Union into a transfer union in which German money flowed south.  At the same time, the German economy delivered the lowest unemployment for two decades.
And yet she finds herself in a difficult position. Her coalition partners, the pro-market Free Democrats, failed to win enough votes to qualify for seats in parliament. It leaves Angela Merkel's conservatives just shy of an absolute majority.
A single-party absolute majority has not been achieved since 1957.  It would have been a historic achievement, but it would have left her vulnerable to some of the eurosceptics within her own party. Narrow majorities greatly increase the influence of back-bench MPs.
That is why many of her supporters favour  a grand coalition with the opposition Social Democrats. Such an alliance is not without risk. Many of the Social Democrats are wary. They were in coalition with Angela Merkel in 2005 and got little thanks for it.  In their view she  stole the credit.
They will bargain hard before offering their support. They might insist on taking the post of finance minister or adopting a nationwide minimum wage or higher taxes for the rich.
In 2005 they had eight ministries. They would be fortunate to have this amount of influence again.
Elsewhere in Europe, however, there is enthusiasm for a grand coalition. Officials in Brussels see the Social Democrats as softening the chancellor's strategy of insisting on austerity and labour reforms in exchange for helping weaker eurozone countries.
French President Francois Hollande, in particular, is likely to welcome a coalition with the leftist Social Democrats.
In this time of horse trading, soundings will also be put out for a coalition with the Greens.  Such a partnership becomes more likely if the demands from the Social  Democrats are too exacting.
Some are asking whether the ""real"" Angela Merkel will now emerge.  She will not, in my view,  act out of character. Her instinct over Europe is to be cautious and that will not change.
There will be no ""soft"" third bailout for Greece. A eurozone banking union will emerge step-by-step. The chancellor will tread carefully, hoping to avoid opening up a change to the EU treaties.
She will be mindful of the strong showing of the Eurosceptic party Alternative fuer Deutschland. It did not get enough votes to qualify for seats in parliament. But it damaged the Free Democrats and will serve as a warning to Angela Merkel not to allow euro-scepticism to grow in Germany.
The success of Mrs Merkel will be welcomed by David Cameron. If he is to successfully renegotiate the terms of the UK's relationship with Europe, he will have to do it with her help.

Predicting the political demise of Angela Merkel has become almost a national sport. Today Germany's battle-scarred leader has herself formally marked what might be termed the beginning of the end.
Mrs Merkel has always said that she could only be chancellor if she also held the role of party leader. Her willingness now to give up the latter is intended to silence critics in her party but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power.
Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it's a loyalist, Germany might witness a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term.
But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz has announced his candidacy. If one of her political adversaries prevails as party leader, Mrs Merkel's chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable.
Mrs Merkel, the country's first female chancellor, rose to power on the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader.
It was, however, her open-door refugee policy that sparked public concern and helped fuel parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
The Greens have also grown in national support.
Mrs Merkel's migration policy has exposed the fragility of her divided coalition government - and even within her own political group.
Sexual assaults by migrants in Cologne and Islamist attacks in Germany all dented the chancellor's popularity.
Mrs Merkel has stopped short of admitting making a mistake, but has said ""if I could, I would turn back the clock many years"" to prepare Germany better for the influx of arrivals.
Among the potential candidates are ambitious Health Minister Jens Spahn; the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet; and the woman seen as Mrs Merkel's anointed heir, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.

A bit like an East German ringmaster in the eye of the hurricane that is the panic, noise and rumour in Europe surrounding Britain's Brexit vote, Angela Merkel has roared for silence.
Schweigen is a German word describing the specific quiet you get when people do not speak.
And schweigen is what Mrs Merkel now hopes for from fellow EU leaders and her own cabinet members, to give some semblance of EU unity and calm.
At a closed gathering of Europe's centre-right parties in Brussels last week for example, she appealed to, or rather instructed, politicians to hold their counsel on Brexit until after the summer.
Crisis or no crisis, you can count on European politicians to unfailingly take their cherished August holiday.
This year, Mrs Merkel hopes it will serve as a cooling-off period for the resentful, fizzing with outrage at ""ungrateful UK"" (like Spain); the vengeful, itching to make life miserable for a post-Brexit Britain (like France); the panicked, worrying about the imminent demise of the rest of the EU (such as Italy); and the media divas/politicians without real influence (such as the president of the European Parliament or the foreign ministers of various countries including Germany) who hog the headlines, making unhelpful waves.
But, canny politician that she is, Angela Merkel cannot imagine that after a splash or two in the Mediterranean, Europe will be much more coherent in its attitude towards Brexit.
She knows it will not be.
But the August time-out gives her space to plan.
September will tell her which UK prime minister she will have to deal with in Brexit negotiations, for example.
And it is policy, attitude and experience that will likely temper her attitude rather than the sex of the UK's next premier, as has been suggested by some (male) commentators.
The summer break will also give Mrs Merkel time to try to get her own house in order.
Next year is election year in Germany and parties are already in campaign mode.
Angela Merkel heads the centre-right CDU party. Both the Social Democrat vice-chancellor and her sister conservative CSU party in Bavaria have already tried to use the Brexit vote to damage her.
The Social Democrats blame Mrs Merkel's austerity programme for souring public opinion against the EU.
The CSU insists Germany must not pay a euro more to plug the gaping hole that will be left in the EU budget by Britain's departure.
But what is bothering Angela Merkel most of all are recent public opinion polls..
German voters are traditionally seen as some of the EU's most enthusiastic supporters but according to news channel N24, 62% of Germans now want decision-making powers transferred from Brussels back to Berlin.
Mrs Merkel, who grew up in the communist East, under the shadow of Germany's World War Two history, is a passionate supporter of European unity.
But ever the pragmatist, she is keenly aware the people of Europe demand change.
For now she seems happy to allow the man sometimes referred to as her ""attack dog"" - remember the Greek euro crisis a year ago? - to make EU reformist noises.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble gave a round of interviews this Sunday, saying time was of the essence and demanding that EU capitals take back powers from the European Commission so as to be more effective in times of crisis.
In fact, rather quietly, Angela Merkel and fellow EU leaders had already whipped the carpet from under the Commission's feet last week, hastily appointing their own chief negotiator for Brexit talks.
The Commission had assumed it alone would play the starring European role in the drama.
And this is just the beginning.
A high-level EU source of mine predicts almighty clashes ahead with the European Commission post-Brexit on the back of the lessons Europe's leaders are gleaning from the vote.
""They [the European Commission] are the real fat cats, the out-of-touch bureaucrats Leave campaigners in the UK complained about, but they are not the EU,"" he told me.
""We, leaders and willing European parliamentarians, now have to wrest back EU control from the civil servants.""
One final reason Angela Merkel hopes for voices in Europe to be silent over the summer is to allow the chaotic proportions of Britain's post-referendum political and economic firework display to make their full impact across the European side of the Channel.

Trade and post-Brexit relations are also on the agenda.
The chancellor arrived at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, earlier for the talks.
She will also meet the Queen at Windsor Castle and address a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting will be a virtual one.
Last week Mrs Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant.
Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany, aside from a few limited exceptions. Those who are allowed to arrive from the UK must quarantine for 14 days.
Mr Johnson is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda.
In contrast to Mrs Merkel, he said on Thursday that double vaccinations could be a ""liberator"" as millions of people plan their summer breaks.
The pair will dine on an three-course meal featuring British produce including an English asparagus tart and Oxfordshire beef fillet during a working lunch.
Ahead of the chancellor's visit, Mr Johnson said: ""The UK and Germany have a steadfast friendship and a shared outlook on many issues.""

The future of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition has been thrown into doubt after her deputy chancellor lost the leadership race of his party.
Olaf Scholz, who is also finance minister, lost his bid to become leader of the centre-left SPD.
The party is now expected to vote on whether to stay in the coalition with Ms Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU.
Mr Scholz's joint challengers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, have been highly critical of the coalition.
Elsewhere on Saturday, the far-right AfD, which is the biggest opposition party in the German parliament, elected Tino Chrupalla, a lawmaker from eastern Germany, to lead the party along with Joerg Meuthen.
Mr Scholz and his running mate Klara Geywitz, who back staying in the coalition until 2021, received just 45.3% of the vote, while their challengers won 53%.
Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken, relative unknowns from the party's leftist contingent, have said they want to renegotiate the coalition deal with Ms Merkel's conservatives to focus more on social justice and investment.
Mr Scholz said the SPD must now ""stand behind the new leadership"".
Paul Ziemiak, general secretary of the CDU (whose Bavarian sister party is the CSU), said ""the decision today has changed nothing"" about the alliance.
Poor election results and mixed views of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Ms Merkel as CDU leader in 2018, have led to discontent within the party.
Some have said a snap election or a minority government could be on the cards. Mrs Merkel has said she will not run again in 2021 after 14 years at the helm of the country.
Last week, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer called for unity while threatening to stand down as CDU leader if the party failed to back her, which prompted a lengthy ovation at the annual congress.
Mr Chrupalla is a former painter and decorator from Saxony.
He replaces one of the party's founders, 78-year-old Alexander Gauland, who gained international attention for a series of controversial remarks, including one comparing the Nazi era to a speck of bird droppings on German history.
""If we want more success we need to change,"" Mr Chrupalla said. ""We want to move toward the centre. This will work because the CDU keeps moving to the left.""

Mr Scholz and his running mate Klara Geywitz, who back staying in the coalition until 2021, received just 45.3% of the vote, while their challengers won 53%.
Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken, relative unknowns from the party's leftist contingent, have said they want to renegotiate the coalition deal with Ms Merkel's conservatives to focus more on social justice and investment.
Mr Scholz said the SPD must now ""stand behind the new leadership"".
Paul Ziemiak, general secretary of the CDU (whose Bavarian sister party is the CSU), said ""the decision today has changed nothing"" about the alliance.
Poor election results and mixed views of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Ms Merkel as CDU leader in 2018, have led to discontent within the party.
Some have said a snap election or a minority government could be on the cards. Mrs Merkel has said she will not run again in 2021 after 14 years at the helm of the country.
Last week, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer called for unity while threatening to stand down as CDU leader if the party failed to back her, which prompted a lengthy ovation at the annual congress.
Mr Chrupalla is a former painter and decorator from Saxony.
He replaces one of the party's founders, 78-year-old Alexander Gauland, who gained international attention for a series of controversial remarks, including one comparing the Nazi era to a speck of bird droppings on German history.
""If we want more success we need to change,"" Mr Chrupalla said. ""We want to move toward the centre. This will work because the CDU keeps moving to the left.""
Joerg Meuthen was re-elected joint leader of the far-right party."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18673218;2012-07-02;EU summit: Was Angela Merkel the winner after all?NA;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
After initially painting Angela Merkel as the loser of last week's EU summit, German papers are reappraising the chancellor's concessions as part of a smart strategy to secure greater gains.
In football, you know the winner the moment the final whistle blows. In politics, it is not so simple.
After the European Union summit on Friday everybody, including the German papers, concluded that Spain, Italy and France were the big winners and Angela Merkel had gone home with a bloody nose.
They had united, stared across the table with their steely eyes - and she had blinked, gulped and given away what she vowed she would not.
But, after a weekend of reflection, a new more charitable counter-view is emerging. It is that Chancellor Merkel did concede - but resisted far bigger things on which she was determined not to bend.
She also bound France into the ""fiskalpakt"" on which she thinks everything else depends. So runs the argument in Monday's German papers.
Her big concession was to allow direct aid from the eurozone's permanent bailout fund to banks in difficulty. The cash need not go through central governments.
But in return, she got a commitment to set up a central supervision authority for banks run by the European Central Bank.
In other words, Chancellor Merkel got an acceptance from France that supervision of French banks would happen from outside France - from the ECB, to be precise.
Sovereignty, on this argument, would be transferred from Paris to the ECB's headquarters in Frankfurt.
As Guntram Wolff of the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank put it: ""The tone of the summit certainly made it look like a big defeat for Merkel, but on the substance of what was agreed I don't think it was.""
""The direct recapitalisation of banks can only come once this new bank supervisory body is up and running. This has been her strategy all along - yes to aid, but only once the proper controls are in place.""
The Spiegel columnist, Christian Rickens, also discerns victory in the apparent defeat for Mrs Merkel: ""At first glance, it looked as though Chancellor Angela Merkel gave up several core demands during the EU summit on Thursday night,"" he wrote.
""But did she? A closer look reveals a clever retreat to secure greater gains.""
And his conclusion: ""Should one be looking for a summit loser, in fact, it is necessary to look no further than Hollande. Not Angela Merkel. She merely did what she always does on the EU stage. She made compromises. And pretty clever ones at that.""
What she also got, so the reasoning runs, was a commitment to the fiscal pact from President Hollande, despite its unpopularity in France.
There had been a feeling in German government circles that Mr Hollande was lukewarm on austerity - but, nevertheless, he has given a commitment, extracted by Chancellor Merkel, to balance the French books.
Chancellor Merkel is too pragmatic according to some who argue  that she bends too easily to popular mood, as she did, they say, when she tore up German's policy on nuclear power shortly after the Fukushima disaster.
Pragmatism, in this book, is seeing which way the wind blows and going with it.
But her defenders say that Mrs Merkel's pragmatism is rather to seek compromise in a complex world - and that this is what she did in Brussels.
The Merkel defenders says she recognised realities. As the Spiegel columnist put it: ""It is also clear to Merkel that she can do no better in the euro crisis than prime ministers Mario Monti in Rome and Mariano Rajoy in Madrid.
""Both have pushed through far-reaching reforms, to the point that they have come under strong domestic resistance. In Italy, elections are scheduled for next spring. As such, it was vital that Merkel allow Monti to land a punch or two.""
So the Monday after the weekend of reflection sees a reappraisal among some of the critics in Germany. Chancellor Merkel constantly says there will be no magic single solution to the euro crisis - it will be step-by-step.
Accordingly, for her it is a long game with concessions granted in return for bigger gains - a rough road to be negotiated one step at a time. Everybody hopes it does not lead over a cliff.After initially painting Angela Merkel as the loser of last week's EU summit, German papers are reappraising the chancellor's concessions as part of a smart strategy to secure greater gains.

Angela Merkel has won a third term as German chancellor, in an election that will influence the future of much of Europe - Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and many other countries. Her skill at coalition-building will be tested again, as her conservative Christian Democrats came just short of an overall majority.
For every country in Europe, it's all about the economy. Across the continent, people are still battling with the twists and turns of the financial crisis. And wherever you are, economic recovery depends heavily on how Angela Merkel treats the next stage of the crisis: these days, most roads lead to Berlin.
That's why it has long seemed to me that one of the most important political reporting jobs right now is to try to understand Angela Merkel better. But Mrs Merkel is an unusually private and reticent politician - there is no exhibitionism and grandstanding. Even for Germans, she's a hard woman to know.
She didn't want to do an interview ahead of the German elections, and certainly not in English - even though she speaks it quite well. But we've spoken to a range of her friends, her political allies and her critics. We've delved back into to her upbringing in the pretty East German town of Templin, some 50 miles from Berlin, and spoken to childhood friends and student mates who knew her at a time when politics was more dangerous and tricky.
Merkel was actually born in Hamburg, West Germany. Her father Horst, a Lutheran pastor, moved the family to the East in 1954 when Angela was just a few weeks old.
As a politician, Merkel has never been overbearing when it comes to her religious views, but it's clear that her father's position in the church had a deep influence on her - creating a powerful moral compass.
Her childhood was also shaped by the Cold War - Merkel's Socialist father held politically charged gatherings at his seminary and as she grew up, vigorous debates rang around the dinner table. The young Angela had to learn to keep her cards close to her chest for fear of drawing the attention of the Stasi, the secret police.
Being unable to openly express your opinion in East Germany affected people in different ways.
An old school friend of Merkel's, Hartmut Hohensee, compared it to lapsing into ""a sort of paralysis, just hoping winter will pass and the flowers will begin to grow eventually"". Merkel's political flowers would begin to grow - but not until 1989, after the Berlin Wall was toppled.
The fall of the Wall produced a maelstrom in German politics. Cafe conversations became street protests; movements became political parties; individuals tried to take control of their country for the first time.  It was this world that Angela Merkel decided to enter, aged 35.
Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, stood out from the rest in that political world.
""She didn't seem to care about her outward appearance at all,"" says Lothar de Maiziere, who went on to be East Germany's last prime minister. ""She looked like a typical GDR scientist, wearing a baggy skirt and Jesus sandals and a cropped haircut.""
To the surprise of many, the East German woman brought up under Communism joined the overwhelmingly male and patriarchal Christian Democrats. In late 1990 she became a member of the Bundestag for the CDU, the largest party in West Germany, and began her rise to the top.
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl wanted someone female, quiet and a former East German for his first post-reunification cabinet. De Maiziere recommended Merkel. Beginning as minister for women, she moved slowly up the ranks, becoming minister of the environment.
But in 1999 the quiet girl from Templin stunned everyone. It emerged that Helmut Kohl, who used to call her his ""Maedchen"" or little girl, had been putting donations into a secret slush fund which he'd used to reward his friends.
Nobody seemed prepared to confront Kohl but Angela Merkel refused to follow the pack.  In a front-page piece in a leading conservative newspaper, she denounced her former mentor and called upon him to resign.  It was a stunning act of political patricide and set Merkel on a trajectory towards the top of German politics.
""One of the things people don't always understand about her is she's… actually a ruthless political operator,"" says Jonathan Powell, who got to know her when he was chief of staff to the UK prime minister. ""The way she dealt with all of her rivals in the CDU was extraordinarily Machiavellian from that point of view.  She would get rid of them in a switch of an eyebrow.""
Angela Merkel became chair of the CDU in 2000 and Germany's first woman chancellor five years later.
The defining moment of her eight years as leader so far came with the eurozone financial crisis.  Greece revealed an enormous  - and unmanageable - public debt. And it soon emerged that other countries were in similar dire straits.  But as Europe waited to see if Germany would agree to bail out the struggling members of the eurozone or force them to sort out their own problems, Merkel was criticised for reacting too slowly.
Caution and consensus, however, have always been hallmarks of the Merkel machine.  ""You can only manage such a crisis if you take a lot of people along the way,"" says Ursula von der Leyen, who has worked in every one of Merkel's cabinets since 2005.  ""Angela Merkel always knew where she wanted to end up, but she took time to find a way which everybody could go along with.""
I don't claim that I have ""cracked"" Merkel - she is an abnormally complex and multi-layered character, unlike anyone else I can think of in world politics.
Quite a lot about her story seems to echo Margaret Thatcher's. Merkel comes from the edges - East Germany, rather than Lincolnshire - and was brought up by an abnormally self-certain and pious father. Something of a loner, she became quite a serious scientist before choosing politics.
Inside her party, she was picked up as a useful female talent by a somewhat patronising mentor - Kohl, rather than Edward Heath - and surprised everybody by her ruthlessness in ousting him, and eventually taking power herself. Like Thatcher, Merkel is a ferociously hard worker, excellent on the detail and a wily political operator.
Yet the differences matter much more than the similarities. Coming from her East German background she believes in social solidarity and working with trade unions; in a coalition-based political system, she is a mistress of consensus and, when it suits her, delay.
Our ignorance of this, the most important female politician in the world, is little short of shocking. Angela Merkel has mattered much more to us and the full European story than perhaps we've realised.
Is she going to remain as crucial in the future? Probably. Now she'll have another chance to secure her legacy.

Quite a lot about her story seems to echo Margaret Thatcher's. Merkel comes from the edges - East Germany, rather than Lincolnshire - and was brought up by an abnormally self-certain and pious father. Something of a loner, she became quite a serious scientist before choosing politics.
Inside her party, she was picked up as a useful female talent by a somewhat patronising mentor - Kohl, rather than Edward Heath - and surprised everybody by her ruthlessness in ousting him, and eventually taking power herself. Like Thatcher, Merkel is a ferociously hard worker, excellent on the detail and a wily political operator.
Yet the differences matter much more than the similarities. Coming from her East German background she believes in social solidarity and working with trade unions; in a coalition-based political system, she is a mistress of consensus and, when it suits her, delay.
Our ignorance of this, the most important female politician in the world, is little short of shocking. Angela Merkel has mattered much more to us and the full European story than perhaps we've realised.
Is she going to remain as crucial in the future? Probably. Now she'll have another chance to secure her legacy.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for Russia to give a chance to non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
She spoke during a visit to Germany by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has backed a series of investigations into foreign-funded NGOs.
The apparent crackdown has drawn widespread international criticism.
In an interview on German television, President Putin said Russians had a right to know which NGOs were receiving foreign funds ""and for what"".
Russia passed a law last year requiring all NGOs that receive overseas funding to register as ""foreign agents"".
It was one of several controversial laws adopted in the aftermath of pro-democracy protests in Moscow.
In her speech to a trade fair in the city of Hanover, Mrs Merkel said Germany wanted to help Russia diversify its economy and innovate.
""We believe this can happen most successfully when there is an active civil society,"" she said, in the presence of Mr Putin.
""We must intensify these discussions, develop our ideas, and we must give the NGOs, who we know as a motor for innovation, a good chance in Russia.""
Mrs Merkel's comments were followed by loud applause. Outside the trade fair, protesters rallied in support of NGOs.
In recent weeks senior EU officials have voiced concern as checks by Russian tax inspectors and prosecutors on foreign-funded NGOs multiplied.
At least two German NGOs - the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) in St Petersburg and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES) in Moscow - were among those searched.
The KAS think tank is linked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, while the FES is close to Germany's main opposition Social Democrats.
Mr Putin has accused the NGOs of meddling in politics on behalf of foreign powers.
A number of prominent Russian groups say that being labelled as ""foreign agents"" is insulting, and harks back to Stalin-era purges.
Later on Monday, Mr Putin arrived in Amsterdam, where several thousand gay rights activists had gathered to protest against anti-gay legislation in Russia.

Skandalös! How about this for a Euro bail-out of a different kind?
Gerry Nolan and his friends from Limerick made this cheeky sign that reads ""Angela Merkel thinks we're at work.""
Thousands of Irish football fans have put work on hold to support their team in Europe.
Euro 2012 begins today in Poland and Ukraine. Ireland will play their first game against Croatia on Sunday.
The group of friends who all graduated from college in Limerick together left Dublin this morning and posed with their flag at Dublin airport before jetting off to Prague.
The boys plan on taking in the Spain game and the Italy game but are still on the hunt for tickets to Ireland's opener against Croatia.
So why did the boys decide to put such a tongue in cheek message on their flag?
""It was purely a joke, it wasn't political at all.
""We were just talking about getting a really big flag and were having a think about what to put on it. We just wanted to lighten the mood a bit - Germany gets quite a hard time.
They are now hoping the hash tag #donttellmerkel will now start trending on the social networking site Twitter as a bit of an in-joke among Ireland fans.
Mr Nolan, 25, thinks Ireland could win it. ""I'm hoping they will do ok. I've booked time off to the final so they would need to do well.""
""I think we will do well in our group, I reckon we could beat Croatia and Spain - hopefully we can make sure Spain will be the first county to exit the euro!""
Never mind Angela Merkel thinking he is at work, what do Mr Nolan's bosses say about him taking so much time off?
""We told them there would be no booze or women on the trip. We are here purely for the culture and the football.""
BBC News has tried to contact the German Chancellor to see if she had a message for the football fans. We haven't had a response yet.
Perhaps she is too busy with work.
UPDATE: The Merkel flag has now been auctioned to raise money for three year old

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the UK that countries ""at the bargaining table"" negotiate better deals than those ""outside the room"".
Mrs Merkel said it was a decision for the British people, but she hoped the UK would vote to stay in the European Union in the referendum on 23 June.
She said the UK as ""part and parcel"" of the EU was of ""benefit to all of us"".
Leave campaigners said staying in might be in Germany's interest but that ""does not mean it's in the UK's interest"".
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the intervention was interesting because a few weeks ago German sources were saying privately that Mrs Merkel wasn't minded to say anything about the referendum.
Speaking during a news conference with Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Obviously, it is up to the citizens of the UK themselves how they wish to vote on the upcoming referendum. I've said repeatedly before that I personally would hope and wish for the UK to stay part and parcel of the EU.""
Angela Merkel has been reluctant to intervene in the referendum debate. She's made no secret of the fact that she wants Britain to stay in the EU; it's an important economic and political ally for Germany.
But she's understood to be concerned about how any comments might be interpreted by British voters. Which is why today's intervention is interesting. Mrs Merkel was relatively cautious. She was careful to emphasise that this is, after all, a British decision.
And then - in characteristically guarded language - a warning. The EU, she said,  would never compromise with an outsider in the same way it would with a member state.
Mrs Merkel's comments may have been timed to coincide with those of other European leaders who've made it plain that they'd be in no hurry in the event of a Brexit to help the UK renegotiate rights and access. But her intervention certainly reflects a growing unease in Berlin that a Brexit has become a realistic possibility.
She said: ""We work well together with the UK particularly when we talk about new rules for the EU.
""We have to develop those together with the UK and whenever we negotiate that, you can much better have an influence on the debate when you sit at the bargaining table and you can give input to those negotiations and the result will then invariably be better rather than being outside of the room.""
She stressed the importance of the single market  - a free trade area which also includes the free movement of goods, people and capital - and said countries outside the EU ""will never get a really good result in negotiations"".
""It would be not only be in our interest but it could also be in the interest of Britain when it can bring its whole political weight to the negotiating table as part and parcel of the EU.""
Labour MP and Leave campaigner Kate Hoey told the BBC Mrs Merkel would be ""well advised to stay out of what is a very, very important vote for British democracy"".
""I really don't think that Angela Merkel telling the British people how they should vote in a democratic referendum in three weeks time will affect anyone's vote,"" she said.
""We can do extremely well outside the European Union - we don't need to be in the single market, other countries trade with the European Union and are not in the single market. We are the fifth largest economy, we can look outwards.""
Mrs Merkel is the latest EU leader to speak out about the UK's referendum as the campaign enters its final weeks. On Wednesday, Dutch PM Mark Rutte warned of a tit-for-tat response if the UK were to implement a points-based immigration system while on Thursday, Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy warned that the consequences of an exit vote would be ""very negative for British citizens"".German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the UK that countries ""at the bargaining table"" negotiate better deals than those ""outside the room"".

Time Magazine has named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as its ""Person of the Year"".
The magazine cited her role in Europe's crises over migration and Greek debt.
Mrs Merkel had provided ""steadfast moral leadership in a world where it is in short supply"", editor Nancy Gibbs wrote.
Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was named runner-up and third place went to US presidential hopeful Donald Trump.
Ms Gibbs wrote of Mrs Merkel: ""For asking more of her country than most politicians would dare, for standing firm against tyranny as well as expedience and for providing steadfast moral leadership in a world where it is in short supply, Angela Merkel is 'Time's Person of the Year'.""
Citing the refugee and Greek economic crises, along with the Paris terror attacks, Ms Gibbs said: ""Each time Merkel stepped in. Germany would bail Greece out, on her strict terms. It would welcome refugees as casualties of radical Islamist savagery, not carriers of it.
""And it would deploy troops abroad in the fight against ISIS [Islamic State]. You can agree with her or not, but she is not taking the easy road. Leaders are tested only when people don't want to follow.""
The magazine also noted her leadership during what it called Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""creeping theft of Ukraine"".
Mrs Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said: ""I am sure the chancellor will cherish this as an incentive in her job.""
After the award was announced Donald Trump tweeted: ""I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany.""
While Time runs a poll for readers to vote, the decision on winners is made independently by the editors.
Mrs Merkel, 61, joins an eclectic list of former winners, including Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill and Richard Nixon.
She is only the fourth woman since 1927 to be named an individual winner outright and the first in 29 years.
The other individual women to win were Wallis Simpson (1936), Queen Elizabeth II (1952) and Corazon Aquino (1986).
Soong Mei-ling won jointly with her husband Chiang Kai-shek in 1937, three women won as Whistleblowers in 2002 and the award went generically to American Women in 1975.
It has gone to other generic groups in the past too, including last year's award which went to medics fighting the Ebola outbreak in western Africa.Time Magazine has named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as its ""Person of the Year"".

Ask a European about strong and stable leadership and, up until this week, they'd have pointed the finger at Germany.
A country proud of its post-war record of political stability and careful consensus-building.
Until, that is, Angela Merkel won the dubious honour of becoming the first German Chancellor since World War Two to fail to form a government.
""What next, Germany?"" is the favourite screaming front page headline of the moment here; the question ricocheting across the country from the federal parliament to queues at local bus stops and on endless TV chat shows.
Germans have been rubbing their eyes, still not quite able to believe that their normally staid mainstream politicians may now be hurtling towards an unruly, unexpected snap election.
But not if Germany's president can help it. Frank-Walter Steinmeier fears a new vote will only benefit the far-right.
He's now ensconced himself in back-to-back meetings with individual political parties, with a hefty dose of arm-twisting and pressure exertion on the agenda.
Today it's the turn of the Social Democrat Party (SPD) to go into the presidential den. The SPD is currently in caretaker government with Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Expect a clash of wills between the German president - an SPD man himself - and party leader Martin Schulz, who has ruled out going back into a Groko (what Germans have dubbed the ""grand"" centre-left/centre-right coalition that has governed German for eight of the last 12 years).
Since talks to form a new government collapsed early on Monday morning, Mr Steinmeier and the new speaker of the German parliament - the former finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble - have peppered their speeches with talk of duty and responsibility.
In tones designed, you might say, to trigger the kind of Lutheran sense of guilt the political old guard here may still be receptive to.
The two men have appealed to grandstanding political players in Germany to work towards forming a government, putting party politics aside for the good of the nation and, they've argued, for the good of Europe too.
The German establishment is painfully aware that others outside the country are also rubbing their eyes in disbelief at the political crisis here.
President Macron, for one, is stunned. Without Angela Merkel and the economically powerful and politically influential Germany at his side, his vision of an ambitiously reformed Europe will remain just that: a vision.
Europe's elite is dismayed across the board. It was gradually regaining confidence after the shock of the Brexit vote.
Things had seemed to be swinging the EU's way with a stronger euro, less support for populist nationalists, plus plans for reforming the eurozone, asylum policy and new cross country co-operation in defence.
But all this requires Germany in the European driving seat, not tinkering in the garage back home.
And what about Brexit?
Well, that's difficult to predict with any certainty.
A contact close to Angela Merkel told me her coalition-building difficulties wouldn't affect Germany's Brexit stance. Certainly the main political parties here are of a mind when it comes to the Brexit divorce issues.
But when it comes to talk of trade and transition, Angela Merkel will be missed if she loses her job or is politically distracted for months on end.
Yes, she is a stickler for rules but Mrs Merkel is also a pragmatist.
She hopes for a good Brexit deal for two main reasons: to benefit German business and also to help keep Europe stronger, by keeping the UK close as she apprehensively views Russia, Iran, North Korea and an unpredictable US under Donald Trump.
The British government has called for creative, imaginative thinking, resulting in an ambitious Brexit deal but for that you need political will and political clout on the EU-side.
No single voice is louder in EU circles than Germany's and Angela Merkel's. If she is silenced politically, that will have a knock-on effect beyond German borders.
So is she finished?
There's talk here of ""Merkel-Dämmerung"", literally 'the Merkel twilight', meaning the petering out of the Merkel era but I wouldn't write her off just yet.
She's a seasoned political fighter who has already served three terms in office and has as good as said she'd be damned if she was going to give up now.
But this is certainly the biggest crisis of her career.
Once dubbed the Queen of Germany and even the Empress of Europe, the extent to which her crown has slipped was painfully obvious as she was forced (through smilingly gritted teeth) to patiently answer repeated questions on German TV as to whether she was the political equivalent of yesterday's toast.
But Mrs Merkel still enjoys personal popularity ratings many EU leaders would dream of and she knows full well her party has no other viable candidate for chancellor.
According to a poll by Forsa, 45% of Germans favour new elections. Mrs Merkel says, if no coalition can be formed, she too favours that option over heading a minority government.
So it's a real possibility.
For many young Germans it's a thrilling prospect.
Frustrated with consensus politics which they view as safe and boring, they hope this could be the beginning of a political earthquake in Germany - a bleeding out of those they see as the fuddy-duddy old guard.
They want German politicians to obsess less about avoiding debt and instead to invest more in their own country - to improve roads and rail services and poor internet connections outside the big cities.
Germany has the lowest infrastructure investment rate of any big, rich economy.
The irony here is that, if this is the start of a German political revolution, it comes at a time when the country has never had it so good economically - with booming exports and a fat federal budget surplus - and when Europe, faced with international uncertainties, relies more than ever on strong and stable German leadership.Ask a European about strong and stable leadership and, up until this week, they'd have pointed the finger at Germany.

They want German politicians to obsess less about avoiding debt and instead to invest more in their own country - to improve roads and rail services and poor internet connections outside the big cities.
Germany has the lowest infrastructure investment rate of any big, rich economy.
The irony here is that, if this is the start of a German political revolution, it comes at a time when the country has never had it so good economically - with booming exports and a fat federal budget surplus - and when Europe, faced with international uncertainties, relies more than ever on strong and stable German leadership."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she wants former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker to become the next EU Commission president.
But some European leaders have voiced opposition to the move.
Correspondents say the UK government sees Mr Juncker as too much of an EU federalist. It pointed to the need for ""a lengthy process to find consensus"".
Mr Juncker belongs to the European People's Party, which won the most seats in the European polls last week.
The centre-right party, which also includes Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrat party, won 213 out of 751 seats in the European Parliament and chose Mr Juncker as its candidate for the presidency succeeding Portugal's Jose Manuel Barroso.
Mr Juncker's main rival is the Socialist candidate Martin Schulz.
EU leaders traditionally choose the Commission head on their own, but under new rules have to ""take into account"" the results of the European parliamentary elections.
Chancellor Merkel said on Friday that the EPP ""with its top candidate Jean-Claude Juncker has become the strongest political power which is why I am now conducting all talks exactly in this spirit, that Jean-Claude Juncker should become president of the European Commission"".
It is seen as her clearest statement of support for the veteran politician, who once chaired the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers that had to make tough decisions about struggling debt-laden countries.
Correspondents say the announcement came despite UK Prime Minister David Cameron making his views clear, at a Brussels meeting earlier this week, that he wanted a reformer to take charge of the EU executive.
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says Mr Cameron was pleased when Angela Merkel sounded at least lukewarm in her support for Mr Juncker's nomination, when she said anything was possible.
But Chancellor Merkel drew criticism from politicians and media in Germany when she indicated that Mr Juncker might not end up leading the Commission, after some member states expressed reservations about him.
The German tabloid Bild said not choosing Mr Juncker would ""turn democracy into a farce"".
Our correspondent says if Mr Juncker does become president he is not thought to be amenable to a wide-ranging renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels.
Downing Street is emphasising that it will be national governments - not the European parliament - which will have to agree on the president.

Angela Merkel has laid a wreath at the former Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, in the first such visit to the site by a German chancellor.
She made a short, emotional speech saying the camp ""fills me with deep sadness and shame"" and said it was a warning of the dangers of indifference.
The visit took place during Mrs Merkel's election campaign and was followed by a rally in a beer tent.
Political opponents called the combination ""tasteless"".
Some 30,000 people died in Dachau before it was liberated by US soldiers on 29 April 1945.
It was the first camp to be built by the Nazis in March 1933.
Mrs Merkel, who toured the remnants of the camp, said it stood for ""a horrible and unprecedented chapter of our history"".
""At the same time, this place is a constant warning: how did Germany reach the point of taking away the right of people to live because of their origin, their religion... or their sexual orientation?""
She said the ""vast majority of Germans"" had closed their eyes to what was going on, and said her visit was intended ""to be a bridge from history to the present and into the future that we want to continue to build"".
Max Mannheimer, the 93-year-old president of the Dachau camp committee, had long lobbied for Mrs Merkel to go to the camp, near Munich in southern Germany.
He hailed her decision as ""historic"" and a ""signal of respect for the former detainees"".
But a leader of the opposition Green party, Renate Kuenast, described Mrs Merkel's programme of the camp visit followed by an election rally as a ""tasteless and outrageous combination"".

At the end of July, Germany was hit by a series of violent attacks, three of which were carried out by asylum seekers. So are Germans turning against Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy? Damien McGuinness in Berlin is not convinced.
""Merkel on the ropes!"" screeched one headline, after the recent attacks in Germany, before going on to predict confidently that her ""premiership is hanging by a thread"".
""Calls for Chancellor Angela Merkel to stand down grow,"" wrote another paper.
But what's interesting about these and similar articles is that they were written by English-speaking journalists reporting from outside Germany.
And in both these cases, the only evidence that Merkel's government was apparently about to fall was a video filmed by Russian TV of right-wing extremists protesting in Berlin. No polling data. No evidence.  Just that video.
You can't necessarily blame the journalists. From the outside the narrative makes sense. Merkel allows Germany to take in more than a million asylum seekers from the Middle East. A year later there are violent Islamist attacks committed by migrants. So it stands to reason that her government is on the verge of collapse.
The problem is, though, the facts really get in the way of that story.  Almost 70% of Germans do not think that Merkel's refugee policy contributed to the attacks, and the violence has barely had any effect on support for her centre-right party, making it unlikely that anyone else will lead the next government, let alone topple the present one.
Since the attacks, her personal approval ratings have slipped, but almost half of German voters, across the political spectrum, say they still want her as chancellor.  In fact, she has no credible rivals - the left-wing opposition is small and the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party is riven with internal rivalries.
In times of turmoil, history shows that the unflappable Angela Merkel actually does quite well.  With every crisis she's written off by many commentators.  But weirdly, like some indestructible rubber cartoon character, she bounces back. From Brexit to eurozone chaos, she's seen as a safe pair of hands.
Even, to a large extent, after these latest attacks. At first there was some criticism that she was too slow to respond.  Immediately after the Munich shooting, in which 10 people died, French President Francois Hollande condemned what he called a brutal act of Islamist terror.  Some here said: ""Why does the French leader speak, and not ours?""
Until, it turned out, that it wasn't an act of Islamist terror at all - but rather a US-style shooting spree, carried out by a disturbed German-born teenager obsessed with right-wing extremism and mass shootings.
And that's the point: despite what the most lurid headlines indicate, unlike France, Germany hasn't yet been hit by a major Islamist terror attack.  In the two recent attacks by asylum seekers, which were claimed by so-called Islamic State, no victim was killed.
That's not to ignore the fierce debate around Berlin's refugee policy - Germany is split. People are nervous about more attacks and increasingly uneasy about migration.  And with parliamentary elections next year, Merkel faces pressure from all her rivals - from the left and from the right.
There are calls to screen migrants better.  Many now say failed asylum seekers should be sent back, whether they've come from a war zone or not.  And dip into German social media, and the criticism of  Merkel becomes vicious.
But no leading politician suggests that Germany should stop accepting refugees fleeing war, and some of the pressure on Merkel comes from left-wing critics, who say she's not doing enough to help migrants.
The debate in the mainstream media, meanwhile, is the very opposite of alarmist. The tabloid, Bild, Germany's best-selling newspaper, has positioned itself as the crusading champion of refugee rights, while traditionally tough-talking ministers have warned against stigmatising migrants since the attacks.
More violence, or a major IS terror attack, could endanger this measured approach.  And some do question whether too cosy a consensus in the mainstream marginalises legitimate concerns that should be debated.
But the attitude of German political leaders also hints at a deeper question - namely, what is the responsibility of government?  Should it lead or follow popular opinion?
Angela Merkel's idea of government is top-down, trust-us-we-know-best, which in this age of referendums and social media is not exactly fashionable.  But she's not following, she's leading. Not everyone agrees with her, and her approach is not risk-free. Merkel, though, is not changing her mind.  And, for now at least, she's staying exactly where she is.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received a dose of Moderna as her second shot of coronavirus vaccine having had Oxford-AstraZeneca as her first, a government spokesman said.
The 66-year-old leader was vaccinated a few days ago after getting a dose of AstraZeneca in April.
Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a good idea but it is too early to say for sure.
Mrs Merkel will be stepping down as leader this year after 16 years.
In March, Germany, along with other European countries, halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a number of blood clots cases were reported.
Germany had previously restricted the use of the jab to over-60s, but is now set to offer it to all adults, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.
After a slow start, Germany's vaccination rollout accelerated in recent weeks.
More than half of the country's population has now received their first dose of a vaccine.
In April, Mrs Merkel's spokesman tweeted a photo of her vaccination certificate to show she had received the injection.
There have been some studies conducted on the mixing of different vaccines.
One study in the UK found that adults were more likely to report mild and moderate side effects after mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines.
Some countries have been looking at mixing vaccines in the face of supply shortages and to improve protection, Reuters news agency reports.
The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have both said they plan to mix vaccines in the near future, amid uncertainty over shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and concerns about rare blood clots.
Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a very good idea. It might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the pandemic virus and new variants of it, and offer more flexibility to vaccine rollout.
Studies are under way, but some countries are already allowing it within their national immunisation programs.
Germany initially restricted the use of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to people under 60 because there wasn't much trial data available on efficacy in older people.
It reversed that decision in April, offering it to all adults. Weeks later Mrs Merkel received her first dose.
More recently, following reports of rare blood clots in a small number of younger people who had the AZ vaccine, Germany recommended that under-60s who had already received a first dose of should have a different coronavirus vaccine for their booster second jab for safety reasons, as a precaution.
Merkel doesn't fit this age bracket, but, nonetheless, she's had Moderna rather than AZ for her second dose.

""In 20 years of politics, I have never insulted anyone.""
Silvio Berlusconi is being asked about claims he once referred to Angela Merkel using two derogatory terms.
""No, I have never had any problems with Angela Merkel.... this has been made up by someone who wanted to turn Angela against me,"" he tells BBC Newsnight in a rare TV interview.
The former Italian prime minister, now 77, once mingled with the German chancellor and other world leaders at global summits.
These days, the three-time leader is more likely to be found at a care home near Milan, where he is carrying out a year's community service after being convicted of tax fraud in 2013.
After years of successfully brushing off sex scandals and allegations of corruption, he has also been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for having sex with an under-age prostitute and abuse of power.
He is currently appealing in this case.
Berlusconi's battles with Mrs Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the height of the eurozone crisis are thought by some commentators to have exacerbated its problems.
""I was not an easy person to deal with and I was quite tough. I had the courage to oppose some of the proposals made by Merkel and Sarkozy,"" he says.
He adds that his relationship deteriorated with Mr Sarkozy because of a differing approach to Libya.
Berlusconi says the Frenchman feared the Italian's relationship with Colonel Muammar Gaddafi would stop Libya from supplying France with gas and oil.
""So he moved before the other countries to attack Libya and Gaddafi and I think it was a big mistake,"" says Berlusconi.
He insists though that he based his politics on ""friendly relationships with all of my colleagues"".
""I have had long-lasting friendships with George Bush, Vladimir Putin, with Aznar, with Tony Blair - many others… so it is almost impossible not to have a friendly relationship.""
The time in 2008 that Berlusconi jumped out from behind a monument in Trieste and shouted ""cuckoo"" to Angela Merkel as she arrived for talks was just a joke, he insists.
He was merely replicating a trick Russian President Vladimir Putin had played on him in St Petersburg days earlier, he says.
""She enjoyed it.
""When Merkel - and I really was on very good terms with her - came to Trieste, thinking of what Putin had done to me, I basically hid behind a monument and I did the same thing.
""It was funny.""
However, their relationship took a turn for the worse in 2013 when, Berlusconi says, he wasn't able to deliver on an economic guarantee he had made to Mrs Merkel.
""Merkel and Sarkozy, during a press conference in October, probably Sarkozy had a journalist ask a question which said: 'Do you believe Berlusconi will deliver on his promises?'.
""Well, the two looked at each other and basically attacked my reputation and my image.""
Berlusconi acknowledges that allegations he has faced about corruption, unpaid taxes and ""bunga bunga"" sex parties have tarnished his reputation abroad.
But, despite his convictions, he protests: ""Italians know very well that none of these facts are true.""
He adds: ""Since I entered politics, I have been involved in 57 trials but I have never previously had to deal with judges.
""Forty-six of those cases were dismissed and I am still dealing with others concerning my assets.
""For 20 years I have spent every weekend and each Monday afternoon with lawyers to prepare the 2,700 hearings that were held against me and my team.
""The bunga bunga accusations were the most amazing things - ridiculous. They manipulated reality. Luckily I am a strong person and I was able to take it.""
Berlusconi is currently banned from public office but retains strong views about the future of the EU and the future of Italy, which he says is ""no longer a democracy"".
It is a ""complete disaster"" for some EU countries to be using the euro, but not others, he says.
""We need radical changes otherwise the economic situation will force us and other European countries to abandon the euro and go back to their national currencies,"" he says.
He says the EU is far from ever becoming a United States of Europe.
""The EU has a very imbalanced economic policy and a very imbalanced tax policy and they don't have a foreign policy.
""When we had a meeting with the heads of state, I proposed to have just one president and I suggested Tony Blair because he was really charismatic.
""George Bush... rang me and asked who he should speak to in order to understand the European position in Iraq. And I told him to try to contact everybody.""

Germans once affectionately referred to Angela Merkel as 'Mutti' - mum in German. Not any more.
On Sunday night, Mrs Merkel ended months of speculation to announce her ambition to stand for a fourth term as chancellor.
It is hard to say when the nickname disappeared from common use. Perhaps during the refugee crisis, as the domestic backlash grew against Mrs Merkel's open door asylum policy.
Angela Merkel: Germany's embattled chancellor
But its usage has certainly dwindled as the role of the German chancellor evolved from that of national leader to one of the most powerful political jobs in the world.
The next incumbent must deal with a fragmenting EU in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration.
In all probability she'll win next year's autumn election. A poll for a Sunday newspaper revealed that 55% of Germans want her to remain in the role. And her conservatives are polling at around 33%.
But even she acknowledges this will be the toughest election campaign she's ever fought. She'll be battling the same tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the US and which is washing over many European countries too.
The anti-migrant party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) has taken significant support from Germany's established parties - largely in response to the migrant crisis.
What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want?
It inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mrs Merkel's conservatives during a recent regional election in her own constituency and it's expected to win seats for the first time in the national government.
While it's unlikely to topple the chancellor, that could complicate coalition building. And AfD's success represents profound divisions within the country.
Mrs Merkel said she'd thought ""endlessly"" about her decision to stand again.
It's generally accepted that Mrs Merkel, a pastor's daughter, has a strong sense of duty and a desire to finish the job. The causes of the refugee crisis remain unsolved.
The controversial migrant deal Mrs Merkel forged between the EU and Turkey - which hasn't helped her domestic popularity - is fragile. She wants to extend the same model to other north African countries. There's a sense of unfinished business.
She's also a passionate supporter of the European project and was horrified by Britain's decision to leave. Other forces threaten to further divide it. Mrs Merkel has made it clear that she wants the EU not simply to survive but to emerge stronger.
And then there's the election of Donald Trump. Mrs Merkel - who's reminded him of his obligation to freedom, democracy and the rule of law - says she has a duty to stand again in the light of struggles for ""our values and our interests and… for our way of life"".
She's rubbished as ""grotesque and absurd"" claims that she is the West's last defender of liberal values. Yet to many of her supporters, that is what she represents.
Germans may no longer view her as a mother figure. And, undoubtedly, she has been weakened by her refugee policy. There is some frustration here at the thought of four more years of Mrs Merkel.
But - overwhelmingly - there is a widespread sense of relief. Mrs Merkel's announcement represents stability in uncertain times.
And by letting the so called K-frage (the chancellor question) hang unanswered for so long, she has highlighted what even her critics grudgingly admit - there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job.

In her office in the Kanzleramt - the Chancellery - it lies on the floor, charging.  But the rest of the time, it is not far from her hand.
Since she has learnt that others might be reading her messages at the National Security Agency in Maryland outside Washington, she has said that she doesn't plan to change her habits.
An enterprising German company has marketed what it calls the Chancellor Phone - one so secure that prying eyes and ears cannot intrude.
The chancellor will no doubt use the Chancellor Phone - but you cannot doubt that recent events have shaken her.
In Germany, particularly in East Germany where Angela Merkel grew up, people feel strongly about the state tapping phones and bugging rooms.
In the east of Berlin,  an amazing complex of buildings houses what was once the headquarters of the ministry of state security, the Ministerium fur Staatssicherheit - the Stasi.
Today, the headquarters is a museum and a home for the vast archive where East Germans can learn who spied on whom.
One Berlin politician learnt after the Berlin Wall came down that her husband had spied on her.  She divorced him.
The offices themselves now display all the paraphernalia of eavesdropping - the hollow tree-trunks with a hole for the camera; the jacket buttons that turn out to be lenses.  The spying of the past is there for all to see.
When communism collapsed, there were 91,000 people working for the Stasi.
It is easy to find maps showing old Stasi premises, and just in the area where I live in Berlin, there are seven places used by the spooks of the Stasi - seven secret flats within an area not much bigger than a football field.  That's how pervasive spying on citizens was.
Just behind where I live, 79 Dunckerstrasse was, it turns out, rented by the Stasi.
At the end of my square - Helmholzplatz - there was an apartment which purported to be for students but which was actually the place where one Major Grabner and his colleague, Wolf, met informers.
At the other end of the square, there is now a bright blue door between a second-hand clothes shop and a chi-chi restaurant.  This used to be the door through which informers would go.
Everybody knew what was going on. After all, Chancellor Kohl used to go off to telephone boxes to make sensitive calls when he was the leader of West Germany - he assumed the official phones he used might be tapped by the East German authorities.
So when Angela Merkel says now that friends do not spy on friends, she means what she says. She knows about it.
But perhaps Chancellor Merkel has just been too trusting despite growing up in a police state.  I've noticed how she seems to have far less security in general than do other world leaders.
I once went to a meeting she was addressing, a big meeting with demonstrators.  One man was striding up and down along the entrance hall, waiting for her.  He had a long stick with a banner on the end of it.
I can remember thinking as she was about to arrive that he was not going to be allowed to remain there, right on her route as she walked by.
And sure enough, the police went up to him.  There was a long discussion.  But instead of him being carted off, as would have happened in the United States or, I think, Britain, he was told that the big stick was a problem.
He was welcome to stay and wave the banner in her face, but not with the stick.
I found that refreshing.  And also the way she keeps texting.

Mrs Merkel then strokes Reem, who is now crying, on the back.
Reem had said she and her family had been waiting four years to gain permanent residency in Germany.
Within hours of the video being broadcast, the term #Merkelstreichelt (Merkel strokes) trended on Twitter.
Some social media users complained that Mrs Merkel had ""petted"" the girl and failed to show enough sensitivity, although others defended the leader's reaction.
In the video, Reem tells Mrs Merkel that her family was told they would have to return to a camp in Lebanon imminently - only to receive a last-minute temporary German residency permit.
""I would like to go to university,"" says Reem, in fluent German.
""It's really very hard to watch how other people can enjoy life and you yourself can't. I don't know what my future will bring.""
Mrs Merkel replied that ""politics can be tough"", adding: ""You are an extremely nice person but you also know that there are thousands and thousands of people in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.""

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been seen shaking for a third time in a month.
Video footage shows Mrs Merkel trembling, shaking back and forth alongside Finland's prime minister during a ceremony in Berlin on Wednesday.
After the incident, Mrs Merkel said she was ""very well"" and there was ""no need to worry"".
A government spokesperson said she would continue meetings as planned.
Mrs Merkel, 64, was last seen trembling two weeks ago ahead of a trip to Japan for the G20 summit. She told journalists at the summit she was fine.
On Wednesday, the chancellor gripped her hands as she tried to control her shaking, standing alongside Prime Minister Antti Rinne.
According to the Focus website, the shaking affected her whole body and lasted over a minute.
She was first seen shaking last month during a welcome ceremony in Berlin for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Mrs Merkel said she was ""working through what happened during the military honours with President Zelensky.""
She added: ""This process is clearly not finished yet but there is progress and I must live with this for a while but I am very well and you don't need to worry about me.""
Mrs Merkel's spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, was questioned by German media as to why the government had not provided any information on her health. Ms Demmer said she had ""nothing to add"".
The chancellor's office has repeatedly dismissed concerns about her health.
But asked by the Focus website what might be wrong this time, leading Bavarian GP Jakob Berger said the chancellor should undergo urgent health checks. ""Her doctors must now press for some research,"" he said.
Following her second shaking incident, another health specialist, Dr Christoph Specht, said that the chancellor could have contracted an infection. He said shivering indicated an infection that was flaring up again.
German media have reacted with alarm to Mrs Merkel's health scare. ""The health of Angela Merkel is now a political issue,"" an editorial in the Bild newspaper read.
Mrs Merkel is now in her fourth term as chancellor, a role she first began in November 2005. She has said she will leave politics when her current term ends in 2021.

Angela Merkel is ""taking back control"" - to borrow the wildly successful, emotive phrase coined by those in the UK campaigning to leave the EU last year.
The German chancellor caused a storm this Sunday, particularly in the English-language press and Twittersphere, when she declared: ""The era in which we could fully rely on others is over to some extent.""
But, contrary to the hysteria about ""Iron Angie"" signalling a slamming of European doors on Trump USA and Brexit UK, what I mean by her ""taking back control"" is this:
Like the UK's Leave campaigners, Angela Merkel is heading towards a vote. Though Germany isn't debating EU membership, it's in the run-up to an autumn general election.
Mrs Merkel is now on the campaign trail and not at all above injecting some populism into her politics.
President Trump is hugely unpopular among German voters and his failure to commit to the Paris climate accord, at the G7, and to Nato's Article Five last week angered many Europeans.
Mrs Merkel's pointed comments about no longer being able to rely fully on allies were delivered to rapturous applause while on the campaign trail in the (conservatively) pumped arena of a Munich beer hall.
Campaign Trail Merkel, as we'll call her for the moment, is also aware that German voters aren't just partial to a bit of Trump-thumping - but also to a full-on promotion of Europe.
Liberal Europeans have felt immensely frustrated at the constant Brussels bashing by nationalist politicians over the past couple of years.
Resentment has built up, too, over Russia seemingly being able to do whatever it wants in Crimea, Syria and the cyber-sphere despite supposed international norms.
And there's real anger and fear about Donald Trump the Unpredictable, a man many in Europe judge to be ignorant about world politics, diplomacy and the workings of a democracy.
Germans believe more than ever now that Europe needs be assertive; to stick together and be strong together.
They are feeling more confident, too, with pro-EU, pro-Merkel Emmanuel Macron as French president.
Enter Chancellor Merkel's emotive language à la ""take back control', except what she says is ""Europe needs to take its fate into its own hands"".
The Bavarian beer hall loved it, as do many Germans, giving Mrs Merkel that edge over her political rivals.
However.
Angela Merkel - political old hand and consummate pragmatist - has not been subsumed by Campaign Trail Merkel.
Would she like to be able to safeguard the stability and safety of Europe without relying on what she regards as an unpredictable US and an unreliable UK?
Absolutely.
She believes Europe must co-operate more on defence: pooling resources, spending military budgets more intelligently and bolstering itself as much as it can.
But she knows full well that Europe can't go it alone.
Certainly not Germany, with its post World War Two sensitivities about taking up arms.
Britain leaving the EU means the bloc only has one military power left  - the French one - and one seat on the UN Security Council.
Nato is now more important than ever for EU safety.
Europe relies, too, on British intelligence and co-operation in fighting terrorism.
Chancellor Merkel has been around the political block more than a few times, and she is not now biting the hand that feeds (bear in mind, too, America's huge importance for German business).
Donald Trump may not be so sure about Nato, but the US vice-president and the defence secretary say they are fully committed.
And at Nato, the G7 and when she visited Donald Trump in Washington in March, Angela Merkel was diplomatic at all times, leaving snubs and small shows of strength to France's keen-to-prove himself presidential newbie, Emmanuel Macron.
When Angela Merkel says Europe needs to be take its fate in its own hands, she means keeping transatlantic links open and strong, but being politically, emotionally and - if possible - militarily prepared if it all falls apart.
Rather than closing the door on the US, she hopes very much the US isn't turning its back on Europe.Angela Merkel is ""taking back control"" - to borrow the wildly successful, emotive phrase coined by those in the UK campaigning to leave the EU last year.

The Bavarian beer hall loved it, as do many Germans, giving Mrs Merkel that edge over her political rivals.
However.
Angela Merkel - political old hand and consummate pragmatist - has not been subsumed by Campaign Trail Merkel.
Would she like to be able to safeguard the stability and safety of Europe without relying on what she regards as an unpredictable US and an unreliable UK?
Absolutely.
She believes Europe must co-operate more on defence: pooling resources, spending military budgets more intelligently and bolstering itself as much as it can.
But she knows full well that Europe can't go it alone.
Certainly not Germany, with its post World War Two sensitivities about taking up arms.
Britain leaving the EU means the bloc only has one military power left  - the French one - and one seat on the UN Security Council.
Nato is now more important than ever for EU safety.
Europe relies, too, on British intelligence and co-operation in fighting terrorism.
Chancellor Merkel has been around the political block more than a few times, and she is not now biting the hand that feeds (bear in mind, too, America's huge importance for German business).
Donald Trump may not be so sure about Nato, but the US vice-president and the defence secretary say they are fully committed.
And at Nato, the G7 and when she visited Donald Trump in Washington in March, Angela Merkel was diplomatic at all times, leaving snubs and small shows of strength to France's keen-to-prove himself presidential newbie, Emmanuel Macron.
When Angela Merkel says Europe needs to be take its fate in its own hands, she means keeping transatlantic links open and strong, but being politically, emotionally and - if possible - militarily prepared if it all falls apart.
Rather than closing the door on the US, she hopes very much the US isn't turning its back on Europe."

Theresa May got stuck in her car after she arrived to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The UK prime minister's door remained locked while staff worked to open it, eventually managing to let her out.
Mrs May is meeting several European leaders and officials in a bid to rescue her Brexit deal after she postponed a House of Commons vote.

Far-right protesters in Germany may be booing Chancellor Merkel, but Syrians are sending her loving notes on Facebook.
The message came in a tweet from Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees on Tuesday. Syrian citizens, the office said, would no longer be subject to the Dublin Regulation. The real meaning behind the rather dry edict? Germany won't send Syrian asylum seekers back to the EU country where they first landed - for instance, Greece or Italy. The move will potentially allow thousands to claim refugee status in Germany, and it seems to have been big news among Syrians.
Overnight it prompted an outpouring of love on Facebook for Germans and, in particular, Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Merkel's reception among Syrians contrasts with the one she received at a migrant centre near Dresden, where she was booed by far-right protesters. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year. Although only a fraction of those were from Syria, that number is greater than the total number of applicants taken in by all 28 EU states last year: 626,000.

David Cameron has had a ""candid"" exchange of views with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over who should get the EU's top job.
The UK Prime Minister objects to Mrs Merkel's favoured candidate to be the next European Commission chief, former Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker.
He is strongly opposed to Mr Juncker's belief in closer political union between EU member states.
Mr Cameron met Mrs Merkel after a dinner for G7 leaders in Brussels.
A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: ""Their discussions focused on the next European Commission - the issues it should focus on and the appointment of the next president.""
Mr Cameron also spoke to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso on the issue, his spokesman said.
Describing the tone of the meeting with Mrs Merkel, a Downing Street source said: ""They had friendly, candid and constructive discussions in keeping with how their bilaterals usually are and in the spirit of finding consensus.""
The BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said ""candid"" was ""diplomatic language for pretty robust"".
Mr Juncker was seen by Mr Cameron as ""too Federalist, too old school and not the sort of person to deliver reform in Europe,"" he added, and it was causing a ""real fault line between Britain and the rest of Europe, particularly Germany"".
EU leaders have traditionally named the Commission head on their own, but under new rules they now have to ""take into account"" the results of European parliamentary elections last month.
Mr Juncker's European People's Party won the largest number of seats in May's polls.
The centre-right grouping, which also includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats but which the Conservative Party left in 2010 to form its own, more Eurosceptic grouping, won 213 out of 751 seats in the Parliament.
The EPP chose Mr Juncker as its candidate to succeed Mr Barroso but Mr Cameron and several other European leaders have voiced opposition to his appointment.
Mr Cameron has been quoted as saying that the appointment could destabilise the UK government to the extent that it would have to bring forward a planned referendum on EU membership to 2016 from 2017.
He was quizzed about why he was against Mr Juncker becoming the next Commission president at a joint press conference with US President Barack Obama at the G7 summit in Brussels.
He told reporters: ""It's important that we have people running the institutions of Europe who understand the need for change, the need for reform and I would argue that that is a view that is quietly widely shared among other heads of government and heads of state in the European Union.""
He added: ""What I want to achieve is to secure Britain's place in a reformed European Union and I have a strategy for delivering that.""
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, said there was no clear backing for Mr Juncker among EU leaders but - in a possible dig at Mr Cameron - said no country could decide the issue unilaterally, adding: ""This is not the time and place for diktats or vetoes.""
Speaking after talks with Mrs Merkel, France's Francois Hollande and Mr Cameron, the Italian PM said the first goal was to define the priorities for the next Commission and then decide on the right candidate to head the institution.

She cultivated the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader and was once dubbed the Queen of Germany and even the Empress of Europe.
Now, Angela Merkel has announced she will not contest the leadership of her own party, and that this term as chancellor - her fourth - will also be her last.
What seemed a given - Mrs Merkel as the leader of Europe's largest economy - is now temporary until her term runs out in 2021.
Her crown first began to slip as the backlash sparked by her open-door refugee policy helped fuel the country's far-right and led to her party's worst electoral performance in almost 70 years in 2017.
With her ""grand coalition"" government increasingly unstable, her last years of power look set to be fraught with difficulties.
Mrs Merkel has said that she has no plans for future political office - something she has held in one form or another since German reunification, seeing off challenge after challenge until now.
""The time has come to open a new chapter,"" Mrs Merkel said, announcing her departure at press conference in October 2018.
Born in Hamburg on 17 July 1954, Angela Kasner was only a couple of months old when her father, a Lutheran pastor, was given a parish in a small town in East Germany.
She grew up in a rural area outside Berlin in the Communist east, and earned a doctorate in physics, later working as a chemist at a scientific academy in East Berlin. She married fellow student Ulrich Merkel in 1977 but divorced four years later.
By 1989 she had become involved in the East's burgeoning democracy movement and, after the Berlin Wall came down, she got a job as East German government spokeswoman following the first democratic elections.
Two months before Germany's reunification in 1990, she joined the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the following year took the job of minister for women and youth under Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
When Mr Kohl was caught in a slush fund scandal, she called for his resignation in 1999, and in 2000 was chosen to lead the CDU.
She became Germany's first female chancellor in 2005.
Early in her political career, she was seen as uncharismatic, provincial and rather dowdy, and tried to shake off that image with a series of bright, colourful outfits and a new hairstyle.
She married chemistry professor Joachim Sauer in 1998.
Mrs Merkel's first government was an uneasy ""grand coalition"" with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).
Then, between 2009 and 2013, she governed with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
As Europe's financial crisis bit, she became the symbol of fiscal austerity, prescribing sweeping budget cuts and tight supervision as the cure for southern Europe's chronic debts.
Critics say her initial reluctance to resort to bailouts weakened the eurozone's credibility but as Germany became the biggest paymaster for the eurozone bailouts, so Mrs Merkel too became the driving force behind the EU's efforts to restore confidence in the euro.
Protesters in Greece and Spain blamed Germany for imposing fiscal austerity, occasionally likening Mrs Merkel to Hitler.
Germany's resilience, low unemployment and healthy exports for years boosted her popularity at home, where she was widely seen as a safe pair of hands in tough times.
In 2013, her FDP coalition partner failed to win a single seat, leading Mrs Merkel to return to a coalition with the SPD.
Her attitude to austerity eventually softened. In a BBC interview in June 2013, she argued that Europe needed more labour mobility to tackle unemployment, with more young people seeking jobs in other EU countries.
Mrs Merkel faced her biggest challenge as chancellor when migrants and refugees began heading in large numbers for Europe's most successful economy.
As late as July 2015, the chancellor was seen by some as insensitive when she tried to comfort a girl who had been waiting for years for residence in Germany.
But as the number of new arrivals grew, she took the lead in opening Germany's borders, temporarily suspending an EU rule requiring asylum seekers to register in the first member state they entered.
She was feted at the United Nations for her humanitarian stance and Time magazine lionised her as its person of the year and de facto leader of the European Union.
The message that ""we will manage it"" - ""wir schaffen das"" - was taken on board by millions of Germans.
But not everyone was happy with the open-door policy and the far-right, populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) was spearheading opposition to it.
What began as anti-Islam marches in the eastern cities of Leipzig and Dresden was becoming mainstream.
Sexual assaults by migrants on New Year revellers in Cologne and then Islamist attacks in Germany during the summer all dented the chancellor's popularity.
Mrs Merkel has stopped short of admitting making a mistake but has said ""if I could, I would turn back the clock many years"" to prepare Germany better for the influx of arrivals.
The biggest sign that things were changing was yet to come. In the September 2017 general election, Mrs Merkel's CDU had its worst result since 1949, while the SPD registered its worst ever showing.
The AfD became the third biggest force in the Bundestag.
The election put Germany in its longest post-war period of coalition-building.
The SPD at first refused to take part, leaving Mrs Merkel with the task of forming a government with the FDP and the Greens. But she failed.
Pressure then mounted on the SPD and, after weeks of difficult negotiations, the parties finally reached a deal.
Yet the coalition was constantly troubled by calls for change and signs of discontent. And state elections in Bavaria and Hesse turned against the CDU and SPD - proving for many that voters were disenchanted with their leaders.
Disappointing results in the 2019 European elections confirmed the decline of both the CDU and its centre-left partner. Mrs Merkel's centre right won, but with its worst ever national election performance, while the SPD came third behind the Greens.
The results left both the chancellor and her anointed successor at the head of the party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, weakened.
However, until she leaves, Mrs Merkel remains one of the longest-serving heads of the CDU, and of modern Germany itself.She cultivated the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader and was once dubbed the Queen of Germany and even the Empress of Europe.

Mrs Merkel and other Western leaders skipped a military parade in Red Square on Saturday over tensions with Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that a Ukraine peace deal was progressing, despite problems.
More than 6,000 people have been killed since fighting began in April 2014 in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and independent experts say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers. Moscow denies it, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are ""volunteers"".
In an apparent conciliatory sign after boycotting the military ceremony on Saturday, the German chancellor flew to the Russian capital on Sunday to lay a wreath at the grave of the Unknown Soldier, close to the Kremlin.
Mr Putin, in a press conference after talks with Angela Merkel, said that a peace deal agreed in Minsk in February was moving forward. ""Things have become more peaceful but there are still problems,"" he added.
Mrs Merkel said Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula had caused ""a serious setback in our relations"".
""However history teaches us that we must do anything possible to resolve conflicts, however, difficult they may be, peacefully and through dialogue,"" she added.
Germany played a key role negotiating the Minsk ceasefire agreement, which stipulated an immediate and full bilateral ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides.
However, the deal has since been violated many times.
Russia staged its biggest ever military parade on Saturday, to mark the 70th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, with thousands of troops marching across Red Square and new armour on display for the first time.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Pranab Mukherjee of India and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon were among more than 20 world leaders who attended the event.
But most Western leaders stayed away in protest against Russia's role in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea last year.
President Putin seemed to shrug off the Western boycott of the military parade. ""Everyone we wanted to see was here,"" he said in televised remarks on Saturday.
Relations between Germany and Russia, which share strong economic and trade links, have reached a low point over the Ukraine crisis and subsequent EU sanctions against Moscow.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's triumphant conservative party is considering who to team up with to form a new German coalition after their election victory.
Her conservative bloc got 41.5% - their best result since 1994, but just short of a clear majority.
The election was a shock for their liberal partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), who failed to get any seats.
A coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is seen as most likely - but only after hard bargaining.
Mrs Merkel told a news conference on Monday that she had already contacted the SPD chairman, Sigmar Gabriel.
""We are, of course, open for talks"", she said, adding that Mr Gabriel had told her the SPD must first hold a meeting of its leaders on Friday.
The SPD came second, with just under 25.7%. In 2005-2009 they were in a ""grand"" coalition with Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the CSU - but correspondents say that the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again.
The SPD suffered a big drop in its electoral support in 2009. That result was widely seen as punishment for having teamed up with Mrs Merkel and been made to look very much the junior partner.
At the news conference Mrs Merkel also said that ""our European policy course will not change"".
She said Germany's labour market reforms in the past decade were a model for other European countries.
Her convincing election victory is seen as proof that many Germans like her insistence on austerity and budget discipline for heavily indebted countries such as Greece.
She expressed regret that the FDP had failed to make it into parliament - the first time it has suffered such a blow in Germany's post-war history.
FDP chairman Philipp Roesler has tendered his resignation and party secretary general Christian Lindner is tipped to succeed him, German media report.
Weeks of coalition negotiations are expected, but the BBC's Katya Adler in Berlin says the SPD will not want to be accused of deliberate delaying tactics or causing a vacuum of power.
The SPD has criticised Mrs Merkel's economic austerity drive, saying Germany should show more solidarity with struggling EU partners in southern Europe.
The SPD leader, Peer Steinbrueck, was finance minister in the previous grand coalition, but has said he would not serve in such a government again.
There is speculation that the CDU might yet form a coalition with the Green Party, though that is seen as less likely than a CDU-SPD government, because of bigger policy differences.
The liberal FDP was beaten by the Green Party (8.4%) and the former communist Left Party (8.6%). It almost finished behind the new Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD), which advocates withdrawal from the euro currency and took 4.7%, just short of the parliamentary threshold.
In theory the three leftist parties - the SPD, Greens and Left - would have enough seats together for a majority. However both the former two have ruled out an alliance with the Left Party (Die Linke), regarding it as too radical.
On Sunday night Mrs Merkel addressed jubilant supporters at CDU headquarters. After waiting for chants of ""Angie, Angie"" to die down, she told them: ""This is a super result.""
""We can celebrate tonight because we have done something fantastic.""
Correspondents say the result is a ringing endorsement of her steady leadership during the eurozone crisis.
Mr Steinbrueck conceded that it would be up to Mrs Merkel to decide how to proceed, saying: ""The ball is in Mrs Merkel's court. She has to get herself a majority.""Chancellor Angela Merkel's triumphant conservative party is considering who to team up with to form a new German coalition after their election victory.
Her conservative bloc got 41.5% - their best result since 1994, but just short of a clear majority.
The election was a shock for their liberal partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), who failed to get any seats.
A coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is seen as most likely - but only after hard bargaining.
Mrs Merkel told a news conference on Monday that she had already contacted the SPD chairman, Sigmar Gabriel.
""We are, of course, open for talks"", she said, adding that Mr Gabriel had told her the SPD must first hold a meeting of its leaders on Friday.

There has been a worried response in Greece to the win for German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Sunday's election.
The front page of the centre-left daily Ta Nea has a mocked-up photo of Angela Merkel on a throne with the headline ""Triumph for the Queen of Austerity"".
Mrs Merkel is seen as the figure behind austerity measures imposed on Greece after its 2010 bailout.
Reaction on the financial markets has been restrained as investors wait to see what sort of coalition emerges.
Greeks blame austerity measures for an unemployment rate that has risen to almost 28%.
""There is little joy here at the prospect of another four years of Mrs Merkel,"" says BBC Athens correspondent Mark Lowen.
""She's come to symbolise the much-hated budget cuts demanded of Greece"".
Greece needs an extra 10bn euros of funding from its creditors next year and now the German election is over those talks can begin.
The Greek government says the country cannot take any more austerity and needs debt relief by lowering interest rates or extending the repayment period of its loans.
Some Greeks hope that Chancellor Merkel will invite Peer Steinbrueck of the Social Democrats (SPD) into a coalition.
He has criticised austerity and called for more growth measures to help this debt-stricken economy.
But Mark Lowen says: ""It's unlikely that there'll be any significant change of policy from Berlin, particularly as Chancellor Merkel's handling of the euro crisis proved so popular with her voters.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party took about 42% of the vote, but finished just short of an absolute majority, official results show.
But she might yet have to seek a grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) who won about 26% of the vote.
""The result of Germany's election is, first and foremost, a big vote of confidence in Merkel and her handling of the eurozone crisis,"" said Nicholas Spiro, who runs his own research firm, Spiro Strategy.
""No other leader of a major economy has been able to reap more political dividends from an international financial and economic crisis.""
As well as Greece, Chancellor Merkel's victory could also allow Europe to make progress on other pressing issues.
Portugal's financial situation remains precarious and the government is pushing for the target on its government finances to be eased.
Last week, credit rating agency S&P said there was an increased likelihood that Portugal might need another bailout.
Progress on the eurozone's banking union project has also been disrupted.
The project has been designed to make the financial sector more resistant to future crises and involves the creation of a central agency to deal with failed banks.
The agency will need some financial backing in its early years, but Germany has so far been reluctant to provide that support.
""The most intense pressure in the eurozone financial crisis may have eased, but there is a still a heavy agenda to work through,"" said BBC Economics Correspondent, Andrew Walker.
""None of this will be popular in Germany, but it is perhaps the price of underpinning the eurozone,"" he said.
Market reaction to Mrs Merkel's victory has been muted, as investors wait to see what kind of coalition emerges after the election.
""It will be tough to buy the euro strongly on the German elections as it will be some time before we know what kind of coalition we will get,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
""Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, dependent on data.
""A coalition with the SPD should result in euro-friendly and peripheral [nation] friendly policies,"" she said.

She is the only female leader at the G8 summit and is well used to high-powered meetings with men in suits.
But on Monday night, German Chancellor Angela Merkel took on a new role - the lady of the lake.
Mrs Merkel took a boat trip across Lough Erne, in County Fermanagh, as she cruised from the hotel hosting the G8 to speak to German media at the Manor House Hotel, near the village of Killadeas.
The late-night excursion took place after a working dinner at the G8 summit at the Lough Erne resort.
Mrs Merkel, escorted by armed police in high-speed patrol boats, arrived at the hotel just after 23:00 BST.
She was met by the hotel manager, David Begley, and then spent almost an hour giving an off-the-record briefing to German media.
Only certain German journalists, who are staying at a hotel in County Monaghan in the Republic, were made aware of the trip.
However, BBC Northern Ireland reporter Kevin Magee was there, following a tip-off from a colleague.
He drove out to the Manor House Hotel, which is about 12 miles from Enniskillen, and said there were ""tell-tale signs"" of something going on with police stopping traffic.
Our reporter, the only Northern Ireland journalist there, was standing in the foyer of the hotel as Mrs Merkel walked in.
""I asked her if she was enjoying her trip to Northern Ireland,"" he said.
""She didn't really answer me. She was very, very businesslike. She stayed in the hotel for 45 minutes. She had her photograph taken on the way into the hotel.
""She had a glass of white wine. She expressed some surprise to the German journalists that they were actually staying in the Republic of Ireland while the G8 is being held in the UK.
""She said goodnight on the way out.""
Mrs Merkel - the only woman other than Margaret Thatcher to have ever chaired a G8 summit - then sailed back on board the Lady of the Lake, the name of which drew approving comments from the German journalists.
And she has not been the only one to take advantage of the water at the G8 leaders' disposal, with UK Prime Minister David Cameron enjoying a dip in the lough before getting down to work on day two of the summit.
Other swimmers reported that water temperatures were invigoratingly chilly, though not unpleasant, the Press Association news agency said.She is the only female leader at the G8 summit and is well used to high-powered meetings with men in suits.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28288449;2014-07-13;World Cup: Will German victory help Angela Merkel?NA;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Will Germany's triumph at the World Cup help Angela Merkel?
She's been accused of shamelessly attaching herself to the footballers and their success, and the polls have shown upward blips of support for her as the team has progressed. But will it last?
There's no doubt the World Cup has played well for her. Within an hour of the final whistle, there seemed to be a million tweets of her pictured in the middle of the sweaty, victorious team holding the trophy, the president of Germany beside her.
She is, by all accounts, a genuine football fan, going to games way before she was politically important. But nowadays the right picture in the right place doesn't do any harm either.
She was there when Germany thrashed Portugal 4-0 at the start and she was there at the final triumph when they lifted the World Cup.
She's been described as the team's lucky charm.  As she and the team's supporters sometimes put it: ""Our twelfth man is a woman.""
But the political benefits of sporting success are not clear - or rather, they are complex and memory plays tricks.
It is one of the great myths of British politics, for example, that the victory of England in the World Cup of 1966 kept Labour in government.
The story runs thus:  Labour and the Conservatives were running neck-and-neck in the election opinion polls and then Geoff Hurst knocked in a hat-trick.
The fans, also known as voters, duly rewarded Harold Wilson at the ballot box and kept him in Number 10.
There's one problem with this oft-quoted canard:  the election preceded the World Cup Final. Labour beat the Conservatives on 31 March and England beat West Germany on 30 July.
The ""feel-good factor"" from victory on the field can't have translated into political success.
But it may have been true four years later.  In 1970 in Mexico, England were dumped out of the contest far earlier than expected.
It was the manner of defeat that hit so hard: England were 2-0 up against West Germany in a quarter-final with 22 minutes to go and over-confident manager Alf Ramsey substituted players to keep them fresh for the inevitable semi-final - except that the Germans then scored three (two in normal time and one in extra-time).
Less than a week later, in a great political upset, Labour and Wilson were dumped out of office.
Wilson said sport was not a factor, but a string of memoirs by his cabinet colleagues at the time revealed that he had been worried about how the World Cup would affect his chances of being substituted out of Downing Street.
But this is all conjecture. There has been much pontification on the link between politics and sport but not much hard evidence.
One piece of serious academic research indicated that whatever benefit there might be to a nation and its politicians from sporting success was negligible.
Georgios Kavetsos of the London School of Economics and Stefan Szymanski, now of the University of Michigan, crunched the numbers.
They used measures of happiness for 12 Western European countries from 1974 to 2004 to see if they correlated with sporting success for those countries. They did not.
But they did find a correlation between measures of happiness and hosting sporting events.
The academics looked at eight separate tournaments: the World Cup in France (1998) and Italy (1990), the European football championships in Italy (1980), France (1984), West Germany (1988), England (1996) and Belgium/the Netherlands (2000).
They found that happiness indices rose in all but one of these countries.
The exception was England, but the measurement wasn't quite comparable - happiness was measured for the United Kingdom not just for England and, strange to say, the happiness of the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish might not move in the same direction as that of the English.
It would be too harsh to say that the happier the English, the more miserable the others, but you get the drift. Either way, the British exception in the study might prove the rule.
The upshot of this research is that Angela Merkel is unlikely to get a great political benefit from the victory of Germany on the field.
She is already widely approved of in the polls and a picture of her with other successful people may just reinforce that image. Think of how an unpopular politician would be greeted if he or she attempted to piggyback on the success of a team.
But the research does indicate that the host country for a big sporting event becomes happier by doing so, however the country's team performs on the field.
As Kavetsos and Szymanski put it: ""We find that the 'feelgood' factor associated with hosting football events is large and significant, but that the impact of national athletic success on happiness, while correctly signed, is statistically insignificant.""
In which case, the big gainer from this World Cup would be Brazil.
It seems paradoxical to say this after the country's football side was thrashed and then thrashed again, with much booing by the fans.
Despite that, the sheer experience of togetherness and achievement in holding the event might bring an increase in happiness. So implies the research.
Step forward the true winners: Brazil.Will Germany's triumph at the World Cup help Angela Merkel?

Ms Merkel has been named the magazine's 'Person of the Year' and Davidson's portrait adorns the cover of the world-famous publication.
He did not meet her in person but took inspiration from photos and footage.
The Belfast-born artist told the BBC that the invitation from Time was ""something you don't turn down"".
""I'm sitting in my studio looking at the actual painting, and to see it reproduced on the cover of Time at this time of year and online worldwide is a remarkable thing,"" he said.
The artist, whose striking portraits can currently be seen in Belfast's Lyric theatre and in the Ulster Museum among many other places, said he was initially a little worried as it was not possible to get a sitting with Ms Merkel.
""All of my paintings, to date, have been the result of meeting and spending time with the person I've painted.
""With this particular commission I was told that the likeness was going to have to be gained through photographic source.
""But I decided to rise to the challenge.""
Davidson immersed himself in finding out about his subject, studying photographs and film and reading books about Ms Merkel.
The process took about six weeks from start to finish, whereas he usually works on a portrait for about six months.
""I love nothing more than sitting in my studio and making work, so I just had to focus completely.
""I always paint my sitters in a very natural light. So I actually had to go back into my archive of personal sitters and look at how the light worked on their faces, so I used lots of my own sources from my studio as well as photographic sources for the portrait.""
Davidson said that while he did not actually meet Ms Merkel, he felt that by painting her, he did get to know her.
""What I wanted to bring out was something that photography has never caught: a sense of compassion, dignity and humanity.
""I'm thinking particularly of her stance this year.""
""What I wanted to do was to portray that, so that whenever people looked at her face and looked into her eyes in the portrait a sense of empathy and compassion would come through.""

She made her comments after meeting the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny in Dublin on Friday.
It was the first bilateral meeting between the two leaders since Ireland exited its EU bailout in December.
Chancellor Merkel was visiting Ireland for the European People's Party Congress, which took place in the city.
She also met the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Eamon Gilmore during her meeting with Mr Kenny at Government Buildings.
Speaking at a press conference after their meeting, Ms Merkel said it was important that lessons were learned from the past and, she said, Europe had to work closely on the banking union.
Ireland was the first eurozone member state to complete its exit from the European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout programme.
The country will still remain under ""enhanced supervision"" until three quarters of the 85bn euro loans are paid off.
The Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an international bailout in November 2010.The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described Ireland's exit from its bailout programme as a ""tremendous success story"".
She made her comments after meeting the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny in Dublin on Friday.
It was the first bilateral meeting between the two leaders since Ireland exited its EU bailout in December.
Chancellor Merkel was visiting Ireland for the European People's Party Congress, which took place in the city.
She also met the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Eamon Gilmore during her meeting with Mr Kenny at Government Buildings.
Speaking at a press conference after their meeting, Ms Merkel said it was important that lessons were learned from the past and, she said, Europe had to work closely on the banking union.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party has won Germany's election, but finished just short of an absolute majority, official results show.
Mrs Merkel urged her party to celebrate ""a super result"" as she looked set for a historic third term.
Her conservative bloc took about 41.5% of the vote - but her liberal partners failed to make it into parliament.
It is thought she is likely to seek a grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) who won 26%.
The results showed that the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) won only 4.8%, which correspondents say is a disaster for the junior coalition partner, leaving it with no national representation in parliament for the first time in Germany's post-war history.
Party chairman Philipp Roesler called it ""the bitterest, saddest hour of the Free Democratic Party"".
The FDP was beaten by the Green Party (8.4%) and the former communist Left Party (8.6%). It almost finished behind the new Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD), which advocates withdrawal from the euro currency and took 4.7%, just short of the parliamentary threshold.
There was at one point speculation that Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister CSU might even win enough seats for an absolute majority - the first in half a century.
Mrs Merkel earlier addressed jubilant supporters at CDU headquarters. After waiting for chants of ""Angie, Angie"" to die down, she told them: ""This is a super result.""
""We can celebrate tonight because we have done something fantastic.""
But, in a reference to coalition building, she said it was ""too early to say exactly what we'll do"".
Correspondents say that the 59-year-old chancellor seemed to acknowledge the complexities of forming a government when she was asked on television if she planned to reach out to other parties.
""Maybe we won't find anyone who wants to do anything with us,"" she replied.
Correspondents say that the result is nevertheless a ringing endorsement of her steady leadership during the euro zone crisis.
CDU parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder said that the party ""has a clear mandate from voters to form a government"". The outcome showed that ""voters want Angela Merkel to remain chancellor"" for a third term, he said.
Mrs Merkel has made clear she would be prepared to work with the Social Democrats (SPD) in a grand coalition, as she did in 2005-09.
The SPD has been more reluctant to consider linking up with the CDU/CSU again. The party leader, Peer Steinbrueck, was finance minister in the previous grand coalition, but has said he would not serve in such a government again.
Correspondents say that whatever the shape of the coalition that ends up forming the government, there probably will not be any significant policy shifts, although Germany might take a slightly softer approach to austerity in the eurozone.
Several weeks of difficult coalition negotiations are expected.
After the exit polls were released, but before official results were confirmed, Mr Steinbrueck conceded that it would be up to Mrs Merkel to decide how to proceed saying: ""The ball is in Mrs Merkel's court. She has to get herself a majority.""
The BBC's Chris Morris, at Social Democrat headquarters, said Mr Steinbrueck was putting a brave face on it but the atmosphere was subdued.
The SPD would have preferred to enter a coalition with the Green Party, but does not appear to have the votes to do so, and has ruled out a three-way alliance including the Left Party (Die Linke).
Analysts think the SPD will probably agree to a coalition with the CDU/CSU.

Fighting anti-Semitism is every German's duty, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told a rally in Berlin.
The protest against anti-Semitism comes 75 years since the start of World War Two, in which six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.
With attacks on Jews increasing, the message to Germany and the world is ""tolerance"" , Mrs Merkel said.
The surge in anti-Semitism follows the summer's conflict in Gaza.
The rally at the Brandenburg Gate - under the banner ""Stand Up: Jew Hatred - Never Again!"" - coincided with a World Jewish Congress (WJC) meeting in the capital.
On stage, Chancellor Merkel began her speech saying the 100,000 Jews living in Germany were a ""national treasure"".
""Jewish friends, neighbours and colleagues, consider yourselves at home here,"" she told the crowd, put at up to 5,000 people.
However, because of the sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks, she said there was ""not a single Jewish institution"" in the country that does not require police protection in the current climate, and it was ""every German's duty"" to take a stand.
""The legitimate criticism of the political actions of a government - be it ours or of the state of Israel - is fine. But if it is only used as a cloak for one's hatred against other people, hatred for Jewish people, then it is a misuse of our basic rights of freedom of opinion and assembly.""
Blue and white blue banners balloons and flags fluttered under grey skies at the Brandenburg gate.
Among the thousands of people in the crowd we met a little boy called Orfeo. He's nine. Already another child at his school has told him he'd kill him because he's a Jew.
No wonder, perhaps, there are such strong feelings here.
Police kept a close eye on a handful of pro-Palestinian protesters.
It's difficult to gauge the effect of recent events in Gaza. Community leaders here say they have partially contributed to a rise in attacks on Jews in Germany. But what concerns them most, they say, is their sense that anti-semitism has become socially acceptable.
During the height of Israel's bombardment of Gaza in July, Germany's Jewish community condemned an ""explosion of evil and violent hatred of Jews"" at pro-Palestinian rallies.
Some demonstrators were reported to have shouted slogans saying ""Zionists are fascists, killing children and civilians"" and yelled that Jews should be ""gassed"".
Last week, a swastika and the words ""Jews"" and the Nazi slogan ""Sieg Heil"" were spray-painted on to a local newspaper building in the eastern city of Cottbus.Fighting anti-Semitism is every German's duty, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told a rally in Berlin.

The phone shields not only phone calls, but also provides a secure link to the German government's intranet. It allows the chancellor to send emails through a highly-secure ""virtual private network"" connection, as well as brief text messages. The only snag is that the phone of Mrs Merkel's interlocutor must also have the same level of encryption, and it doesn't come cheap. Secusmart's chip costs 2,500 euros (£2,000; $3,400).

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she can work with the UK to reform the European Union but it will not be ""a piece of cake"".
Following a Downing Street meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron, she said both countries could bring in laws to restrict benefit tourism, as part of ""overall European cooperation"".
Mr Cameron said changes to the EU were ""possible, achievable and doable"".
Mrs Merkel addressed Parliament earlier - and later had tea with the Queen.
She also had a meeting with Mr Cameron in Downing Street, with a picture being released of the two of them chatting on the sofa in the Camerons' flat.
Mr Cameron is keen to negotiate changes to the UK's treaties with the EU ahead of a promised referendum on whether the country should remain in the organisation, which he wants to hold before the end of 2017.
He regards Mrs Merkel as a key figure in achieving his aim and has organised several events to welcome the German leader during her one-day visit to London, including tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
At the Downing Street press conference, Mr Cameron said he and Mrs Merkel ""both want to see changes in Europe"".
He added that EU rules on freedom of movement needed to change to ensure people could not move from country to country to sign up for welfare payments.
Mrs Merkel said the UK and Germany could pass laws to limit this problem, saying: ""Where there's a will, there's a way.""
She said freedom of movement was intended to allow people to work in different countries, not ""having immigration into social systems"".
However, speaking of changing the EU, she said: ""It is not a piece of cake. It is going to be hard work.""
Earlier, Mrs Merkel addressed both Houses of Parliament.

""Others are expecting the exact opposite and they are hoping that I will deliver the clear and simple message here in London that the rest of Europe is not prepared to pay almost any price to keep Britain in the European Union. I am afraid these hopes will be dashed.""'
Mrs Merkel hailed the peace and stability she said the European Union had brought, saying war between EU member states was now ""inconceivable"".
She praised the ""unparalleled success"" of the EU free market - and the freedoms she said European integration had delivered - but stressed that ""we need to change the political shape of the EU in keeping with the times"".
She told the UK's gathered political leaders the SU had to become stronger, saying: ""In order to attain this goal we need a strong United Kingdom with a strong voice inside the European Union.

The Guardian reported on Wednesday that Berlin was prepared to offer ""limited opt-outs"" to the UK over its future compliance with existing EU directives and to make sure some other regulations were more flexibly enforced.
The newspaper said it was a sign of the lengths that Germany was willing to go to to ensure the UK remained a member of the EU amid fears in Europe that a referendum could lead to British withdrawal.

At the moment, the country is one of seven in the 28-nation EU without a minimum wage level.
Germany has relied on trade unions and business groups to fix pay instead.
Mrs Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats approved the change as part of a power-sharing deal with the Social Democrats (SPD).
The SPD was in favour of the move, but the conservative CDU and CSU parties had been keen to keep the status quo.
Parliament is expected to debate the proposal this summer. It will then move to the upper house for approval in September.
Economists said higher wages in Europe's biggest economy could help people spend more and stimulate the economy, promoting economic growth.
The SPD's labour market policy spokesperson, Katja Mast, said: ""Labour has got its dignity back with a fair payment of 8.50 euros, whether in the East or West and with no industry exceptions.""
But the wage does not cover minors, interns, trainees or long-term unemployed people for their first six months at work.
Some employers, such as those using temporary or seasonal, workers, will have two years to phase in the new minimum wage.
For the rest of Germany's employers, the regulations will come into effect on 1 January 2015. The wage will be reviewed annually from 1 January 2018.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has approved the country's first minimum wage, at 8.50 euros an hour (£7; $11.75), to start in 2015.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said US and British spying ""sows distrust"" among allies.
She used her inaugural address to parliament after her re-election to warn that such surveillance ultimately undermined mutual security.
She also accused the UK and US of using spy agencies to gain economic advantage rather than just for security.
In October, Germany summoned the US ambassador over claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile.
The chancellor at that time demanded a ""complete explanation"" of the claims, which were made in news magazine Der Spiegel.
The magazine based its stories on material from Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA).
The White House said when the allegations emerged that it was not monitoring her calls and would not do so in future.
However, it left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past.
In a separate development on Wednesday, US spy chief James Clapper said that Mr Snowden's leaks had severely damaged America's national security apparatus.
Mr Clapper told a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the leaks have aided America's adversaries and undermined co-operation with foreign partners.
""What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programmes,"" he said.
""As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners.""
Mr Clapper has been accused of lying at an earlier Congress hearing over the extent of the NSA's surveillance activity.
Earlier this week a group of congressmen was pushing for him to be fired over the issue.
In the first major speech of her third term, after winning September's election, Mrs Merkel said nobody doubted that intelligence agencies had helped to protect the German people from terrorism and crime.
""But does that make it right for our closest allies, like the United States or Britain, to access all imaginable data - arguing that it helps their own security and that of their partners,"" she said.
""Can it be right that it's not just about defending against terrorist threats but also to gain advantage over their allies, for example, in negotiations at G20 summits or UN sessions?
""Our answer can only be: 'No, that cannot be right.'""
She warned that succumbing to the temptation to ""do everything that is technically doable"" led to mistrust between allies.
However, she emphasised that the ""transatlantic partnership remains of outstanding importance"".
But she conceded that the allies remain ""far apart"" on the ""ethical question"" of freedom versus security in state surveillance.
State-monitoring of phone calls has a particular resonance in Germany. Mrs Merkel grew up in East Germany, where phone-tapping was pervasive.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said US and British spying ""sows distrust"" among allies.
She used her inaugural address to parliament after her re-election to warn that such surveillance ultimately undermined mutual security.
She also accused the UK and US of using spy agencies to gain economic advantage rather than just for security.
In October, Germany summoned the US ambassador over claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile.
The chancellor at that time demanded a ""complete explanation"" of the claims, which were made in news magazine Der Spiegel.
The magazine based its stories on material from Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA).

Angela Merkel looked exhausted, strained, as she arrived at her party headquarters in the evening after the election ended.
Emerging from her car she arranged her face into a smile first for the cameras and then for the party faithful who'd gathered at CDU headquarters.
The chancellor knew she would most likely win this election. But it is not the victory she or her party had hoped for. It is the conservatives' worst election result under her leadership. A verdict, perhaps, on her decision to open Germany's doors to one million refugees.
Addressing her party, Mrs Merkel acknowledged the past four years had been hard. Nevertheless the party had still achieved its aim - to finish first.
The cheers rang a little hollow. Because the real success story of this election belongs to AfD.
Across the city, in a room filled with blue and white balloons, members of the anti-immigrant, anti-euro party cheered as it became clear they would not only enter the German parliament for the first time, but would be the third-largest party in the Bundestag after Mrs Merkel's conservative CDU and her nearest rivals, the social democratic SPD.
Alexander Gauland is one of the AfD's leaders - and now one of its MPs. Triumphantly, he told the jubilant crowd that his party would hunt down Mrs Merkel.
""Take back the country and the people"": for a Germany post-World War Two, it is extraordinary rhetoric.
But then AfD's overtly xenophobic campaign, and the heckling which marred a number of Mrs Merkel's rallies, are almost without precedent too. Outside the victory party, police officers kept a careful eye on anti-AfD protesters demonstrating against what is, for many, a shocking political development.
It was a chaotic day for German politics. And for Berlin too, which hosted the annual marathon as voters went to the polls.
There is division, discontent, in the heart of this country. Among the crowds watching the runners cross the finish line, one man told me he was horrified by the rise of the right-wing nationalists.
""They are like the Nazis under Hitler,"" he said. ""I was born in 1939. I'm a war child. I grew up in the ruins and now we get this again. They are criminals. I've always voted CDU and I want Angela Merkel.""
Mrs Merkel must now find coalition partners. Don't expect AfD to be invited.  She must also persuade her country - perhaps some within her party - that's she is the right woman for the job.
It has been a long and bruising election campaign. Mrs Merkel may have won the election but it does not feel like much of a victory.
This election will go down in the history books for two reasons. Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term but it is her worst-ever general election result. And right-wing nationalists are now part of the German establishment.

Mrs Merkel said: ""I'm pleased that we managed to kill Bin Laden"", and called his death ""a victory"".
Some prominent Christians have accused her of rejoicing at the killing.
A Green Party member of parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, said: ""As a Christian, I can only say that there is no reason to celebrate when someone is killed intentionally.""

Siegfried Kauder, the chairman of parliament's legal affairs committee, also asked whether it was an ""arbitrary killing"" - which he said would be against human rights conventions.
The views were echoed by other Christians across the German political spectrum.
There is also a view on the left that Bin Laden was targeted for death and not arrest.

German authorities are investigating how a man was able to spend four hours partying alone in his underpants on a military jet used by Angela Merkel.
The 24-year-old entered the cockpit, pushed buttons randomly, deployed an emergency slide, and sprayed a fire extinguisher over the plush interior.
Police using a megaphone tried and failed to persuade the man to leave.
They found a bag with his identity documents and, allegedly, ecstasy and marijuana near the aircraft.
The incident, at Cologne airport on 25 July, was brought to a close by a police dog biting the man in the leg.
The suspect, named only as Volkan T, has been taken to a psychiatric institution.
He is reportedly a German bodybuilder of Turkish descent who was not previously known to police.
Berlin-based paper Welt am Sonntag has seen a leaked police log of the incident and claims the document shows ""security weaknesses"" and ""errors"" by the air force.
The incident got underway when the local resident, reportedly carrying his bag of drugs and suffering from relationship worries, made his way to the military part of Cologne-Bonn airport.
He got through the gate by saying he was planning a wedding at the officers' mess and wanted to look at the building again.
From there he was able to climb over a barbed wire fence onto the military airfield, undetected by security cameras.
Spotting the government plane, one of two Airbus A319s maintained by the German military for high-ranking politicians' use, he climbed onto its wing where he proceeded to dance in his underwear.
From there he was able to open the emergency exit door and enter the plane.
The door to the cockpit was open; the man ""pressed all the the buttons at random,"" eventually activating an alarm.
The plane was full of fuel and could have been flown as far as Beijing, the Welt am Sonntag claims, had the intruder had the requisite knowledge.
It was another three hours before the plane was secured, in which time the man allegedly caused around 100,000 euro ($134,000, £85,000) worth of damage.
The aircraft, used by Chancellor Merkel for official trips, is fitted out in cream and beige with a private office with two VIP seats and a sofa, a conference suite and a further 32 seats for delegations.
It has been repaired and is now back in the service of the nation.
