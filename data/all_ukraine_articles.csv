Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/russia-and-the-west-compete-to-secure-safe-passage-for-ukraines-grain;2022-06-02;Russia and the west compete to secure safe passage for Ukraine’s grain;"Analysis: both sides agree grain must reach world markets soon but each wants to decide how
In a game of diplomatic cat and mouse, Russia and the west are coming up with similar if sometimes competing ideas for how Ukraine’s badly needed grain can be given safe passage through the Black Sea and on to the world markets. They are also competing to win the battle for world opinion if the plans collapse.
Both sides are busy diplomatically across Africa and the Middle East trying to portray their adversary as the culprit for spiralling food and fertiliser prices. Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, while Russia is the world’s top fertiliser exporter. The World Bank’s Fertiliser Price Index rose nearly 10% in the first quarter of 2022, to an all-time high in nominal terms.
Ukraine’s backlog of 20m tonnes of grain needs to be exported quickly to avoid a further explosion of food prices, and also to preserve the next Ukrainian harvest that currently cannot be sent to already full storage facilities.
That is not possible due to the Russian naval blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa, and Ukrainian floating mines planted to block the port from Russian attack. Russia, in return for lifting the blockade, wants any sanctions on its shipping and fertiliser products lifted. At issue is whether there is a deal to be done.
In what is beginning to look like the main plan, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has agreed to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but not until 8 June, over proposals for Turkey to de-mine Odesa and then escort grain ships through to the Bosphorous along a naval corridor. Erdoğan spoke with Vladimir Putin about the proposal on Monday, and according to the Turkish read-out, Putin was willing to cooperate, on conditions.
Turkey, through the 1936 Montreux convention, is arbiter of sea traffic in and out of the Black Sea, and justifies its refusal as a Nato member to impose sanctions on Russia by pointing to this unique role. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said on Tuesday that food security was the most important question: “We are focusing on this. We are planning to establish a centre in Istanbul to observe the corridor.”
Within Europe, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has taken the practical initiative, discussing the issue first with Joe Biden a fortnight ago then last week holding talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, then Putin and then Zelenskiy again.
The Ukrainians have said they are willing to see Odesa de-mined, but conditions would have to be set on how the Russian navy would not use the clearance of mines as an opportunity for its warships to move closer to the port. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: “We must be very careful, because a unilateral guarantee from the Kremlin is not enough. We need third countries to take responsibility for enforcing the agreement.”
Italy and the UK have offered to undertake the de-mining operation, something that could take a fortnight, but Turkey may be Russia’s preferred choice to complete this perilous task.
According to Draghi, Putin has indicated that he would open access to Odesa provided valid checks could be made to ensure the grain ships were not carrying weapons for use by Ukraine. Unresolved issues also exist about the nationality of the ships escorting the convoy, and their terms of engagement if threatened by Russia.
According to Moscow, Putin noted the “readiness of the Russian side” to facilitate the unhindered sea transit of goods in coordination with Turkish partners.
But Russia also wants in return the lifting of western sanctions on Russian fertilisers, something Draghi says is also being urged on the EU by Africa and warrants a second look.
The US is also showing some flexibility. Its ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US was prepared to give “comfort letters” to shipping and insurance companies to help facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertiliser.
She insisted that Russian grain and fertiliser were not under US Treasury sanctions but that “companies are a little nervous and we’re prepared to give them comfort letters if that will help to encourage them”. She stressed this was not a bargain to get the Russian blockade of the port of Odesa lifted.
At the moment, the UK and the EU may be heading in contradictory directions by coordinating a ban on insurance for ships carrying Russian oil anywhere in the world. Distinguishing insurance for grain as opposed to oil ships is feasible, but could prove a complicating factor.
One possibility is that Rebecca Grynspan, a senior UN official – recently in Moscow for talks on the issue – could help negotiate a draft security council resolution backing the humanitarian corridor, an idea backed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. One western official said: “It is unlikely even Russia could veto a resolution to feed the world simply because Russian demands on the lifting of sanctions had not been met.”
Draghi is not opposed to the UN involvement but has fears about the pace of progress. He said: “It can play an important role in resolving the crisis, but we have a duty to ask ourselves how we can help. How to accelerate, to avoid arriving late.”
However, the UK, Poland and Baltic states are sceptical that Putin will ever agree. Britain backed Lithuania’s proposal for a similar convoy plan, but one that did not depend on Russian cooperation. It proposed a coalition of the willing – not a Nato force – to escort ships.
Egypt, one of the many middle- and lower-income countries heavily dependent on Ukrainian and Russian grain, was mentioned as a possible member of the coalition. The plan certainly seemed to gain favour with the hawkish UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, when she met the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis. It was significant that Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, made a rare visit to Cairo this week to discuss the grain crisis.
But Gen Mark Milley, the chair of the US joint Chiefs of Staff, struck a cautious note in London on Tuesday, saying: “To open up those sea lanes would require a very significant military effort.” If policymakers opted for it, “it would be a high-risk military operation that would require significant levels of effort”, he said. It is for that reason Draghi, Macron and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, felt that it was necessary to test Putin out.
If none of the sea-route options works, the only alternative is to intensify the use of existing and much more expensive routes that take grain on trucks through Poland to Baltic and Polish ports, or on barges down the Dnieper River to Romanian ports and finally via train to Poland. The option of taking grain by train through Belarus looks impossible due to Minsk’s demands for sanctions on potash to be lifted.
At the main crossing point into Romania there is a 20km backlog of trucks waiting to be inspected. A queue of 100 barges were at the Dnieper River waiting to get to the Black Sea. Only seven vessels were being cleared a day.
Apart from the humanitarian necessity to avoid famine, Draghi regards the risks to the west of spiralling bread prices, in terms of migratory flows, terrorism and political instability, as real and imminent. As one Italian official put it: “We have two weeks left to sort this or we face something very grave.”"

The US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops on to the battlefield, the Pentagon said.
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.”
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory.
Following Joe Biden’s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which will be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and Blinken on Thursday, Politico cited a source as saying.
Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. “Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” Serhiy Gaidai said, adding that a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk, the largest citystill held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. Western officials said Ukraine’s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed is “pretty credible”.
A Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel.
Russia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound.
Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces.
Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.
Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen."

Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe’s security landscape.
The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.
Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack.
“Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published.
“We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together.
“Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.”
Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033.
“Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out.
“The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party.
Participation in the EU’s defence policy will allow Denmark, a founding Nato member, to take part in joint EU military operations, such as those in Bosnia, Mali and Somalia, and will allow Danish officials to stay in the room when EU colleagues discuss defence issues.
EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result.
Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit.
“This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter.
It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies.
Those opposed to abandoning the opt-out argued that the EU’s defence cooperation is hampered by excessive bureaucracy and inefficient decision-making, and that a joint European defence would come at the expense of Nato."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/raise-the-roof-scotland-and-ukraine-fans-unite-in-song-at-hampden;2022-06-01;‘Raise the roof’: Scotland and Ukraine fans unite in song at Hampden;"Supporters of both teams sing Ukrainian national anthem before Wednesday night’s World Cup qualifier in Glasgow
Standing on the steps of Hampden in the late afternoon sunlight, Jim Struthers is wearing the same Scotland top he wore in 1998 – the last time his team qualified for the World Cup – but his heart is with Ukraine.
“It’s a very poignant evening,” says the Tartan Army stalwart, who has been supporting the Scottish national team for nearly half a century, and has come together with other fans to perform the Ukrainian national anthem – led by the opera singer Vasyl Savenko – on the steps of the Glasgow stadium as the crowds stream in for Wednesday’s qualifier.
“Part of you says it wants Ukraine to do well and part says: ‘Oh no, no, no …’ I feel for Ukraine, my passion is football, and this is a good way to connect.”
“It’s like Rabbie Burns,” he muses. “He wrote that the time will come when all will brothers be.”
The plan for Scots to join Ukrainian fans in singing their national anthem inside Hampden as an expression of unity was prompted by the language learning app Duolingo.
“It was one of those ideas that just snowballed,” explains the app’s UK manager, Colin Watkins. A phonetic Latin version from the original Cyrillic script of Shche Ne Vmerla Ukrayina was produced for Scots to practise in advance and fans walking into the stadium will all receive a leaflet explaining the plan “to raise the roof at Hampden Park”.
For the professional musician Iryna Ganzha, who is accompanying the singing on the bandura, a 65-string instrument made only in Ukraine, the significance of Wednesday’s match and show of vocal solidarity is immense.
“This is incredibly important for the whole of Ukraine to see, those who cannot be here, our brave women and men on the frontline,” she said.
“Ukraine is a singing nation, we express ourselves through music, and so the support of the Scottish people standing hand in hand with us and also voice to voice means so much.”
There were around 3,500 Ukraine fans in attendance at Hampden Park, including an invited group of orphans, able to witness their team’s surprise 1-3 victory over the Scots. Ukraine will now play Wales on Sunday at 5pm in Cardiff for the chance to qualify for the Qatar World Cup which begins in November.
Earlier, around the stadium, the usual festival atmosphere was undercut by a pulse of raw emotion. Kostaia waves his flag wildly in time to the folk songs that another supporter is belting out by the car park. She wears the traditional floral crown paired with jeans, like many female Ukrainian fans at the stadium.
Kostaia has travelled from London today: his boss, a Scot, gave him the day off. “Today is very difficult for me because of what is happening in my country.” His eyes are wet. “I want to help but I can’t.”
But the show of solidarity is not reserved for Hampden, as fans came together across Scotland on Wednesday evening.
In the Highland Perthshire town of Aberfeldy, where the community has welcomed 40 Ukrainians since the conflict began, the Black Watch pub is draped in both saltires and the blue and yellow bands of Ukraine for the occasion.
“This is an opportunity to have a bit of normality together,” explains the pub’s owner, Gavin Price, who is also manager of Elgin FC. “It’s been a settling-in process for all of us. It’s a friendly buildup, but when it comes to the football I’m sure both nations wants their team to win.”
Hannah Beaton-Hawryluk, the chair of the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, travelled to Hampden with her son after arranging two coaches to transport fans from the capital to Glasgow.
“It’s a little bit of light relief for people who arrived here, some with only the clothes they stand up in. It’s about being together and celebrating no matter what the outcome.”
Beaton-Hawryluk anticipates that singing her national anthem alongside home supporters at kick-off will be an “incredible” moment. She apologises as her voice breaks.
The association, which was founded in Edinburgh in 1946, has been so busy offering support to refugees who began arriving in February that she only now has a moment to reflect.
“Scots have been incredible from the moment the war started. They have rallied round and put their arms around Ukraine,” she said."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/01/minnesota-paper-free-new-owner-ukraine;2022-06-01;Proprietor offers Minnesota paper free to new owner so he can fight in Ukraine;"Lee Zion seeks owner with ‘knowledge, experience and drive’ to take on Lafayette Nicollet Ledger, which reaches 100% of residents
For most newspapers, a subscription rate of 100% of the residents in their distribution area would be a success so huge as to be unimaginable. But Lee Zion, whose tiny Lafayette Nicollet Ledger reaches all 500 people in the tiny Minnesota town of Lafayette, says he is throwing in the towel – because he wants to fight for Ukraine.
Zion is offering to give away the weekly publication, which is profitable and free of debt, before he goes off to fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Zion, 54, bought the Ledger four years ago for $35,000, after working in journalism for decades.
“To put out a good newspaper, they have to do what I do,” Zion warned prospective owners in an interview with Minnesota’s Star Tribune. “And that is, do everything myself with only a handful of [freelancers], and work seven days a week and never take time off.”
An advertisement posted in the journal said Zion “wants to leave the paper in good hands. To get this newspaper, entirely free of charge, the next owner must show that he or she has the knowledge, experience and the drive to take on the challenge.”
Zion’s motivation to volunteer to fight against Russian soldiers is complex. Before the invasion, he concedes, he didn’t care much about Ukraine, but he did have strong feelings about the bandura, a plucked string folk instrument that combines elements of the zither and lute and is considered Ukraine’s national instrument.
“It’s a gorgeous instrument. I thought, someday I’m going to buy one,” Zion told the Star Tribune. “And Russians murdered people just for the crime of playing it.
“Sounds silly, but at the same time, it’s so silly that it’s evil,” he added.
Zion contacted a bandura chorus in Toronto who advised him to contact the Ukrainian consulate in Chicago. Ukraine officials told the Military Times in March that they were looking for foreign volunteers with combat experience who would require little training before being armed and sent to the frontline.
“Where I go, that is up to other people,” he said. “They’ll decide whether I’m going to be in a combat zone. They’ll decide whether I dig ditches. They’ll decide whether I’m a teacher. I can be an escort taking people out of Ukraine.
“Maybe they’ll put me into news, because that’s what I’ve been doing my whole adult life.”
Some won’t be sad to see him go. In a 7 March 2019 editorial decrying anti-immigrant sentiment, he suggested that if people with xenophobic attitudes did not want to fight a declining birthrate by accepting immigrants into the country, then women should have sex with him instead.
A letter from Jan Anderson of Lafayette, publicly posted to Zion on Facebook and partially republished by South Minnesota News, called the editorial “disgusting, disturbing, and downright creepy” and called for Zion to leave town: “We are asking that Mr Zion make Lafayette, and the surrounding communities, less creepy again by packing up your wares and opening shop someplace else.”"

Ukraine has promised Washington it will not use advanced rocket systems supplied by the US to hit targets inside Russian territory, as Moscow warned that the move risked a “third country” being drawn into the war.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that after Joe Biden’s agreement to provide Ukraine with multiple-launch rocket systems, Ukraine had “given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory”.
The US plans to supply the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (Himars) equipped with munitions with a range of about 50 miles, but not the more advanced rockets that can fly 185 miles. Himars is light, highly mobile and can be quickly reloaded by its crew.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Saudi Arabia, said the supply of the rocket launchers to Ukraine raised the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such supplies would not encourage Ukraine’s leadership to resume stalled peace talks. “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire,” he said. “In order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever.”
Shortly after the US decision was announced, the Russian defence ministry said Russia’s nuclear forces were holding drills in Ivanovo province, north-east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk.
With Ukraine facing reverses in the battle for Donbas, Kyiv has been pushing hard for allies in Europe and the US to supply long-range artillery systems in attempt to redress the balance for its outgunned and outnumbered forces in a war that has increasingly become dominated by intense artillery duels.
Each launcher can carry six GPS-guided rockets, which can be reloaded in about a minute, and the system is considered more advanced than other rocket systems that Ukrainian forces currently use.
Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, said Washington believed the system would meet Kyiv’s needs. “This is a defensive conflict that the Ukrainians are waging. Russian forces are on their territory,” Finer said in an interview with CNN.
He said there were significant targets that Ukrainians could not reach with the weapons they had, and the rocket system would make a big difference in the conflict in the south-eastern part of the country, where Russian forces are currently focused.
However, there was some scepticism among defence analysts over how significant an impact the delivery of Himars might have on the battlefield in the immediate future, pointing to questions over Ukraine’s ability to effectively deploy it.
Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.
“Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentarily use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.”
While the weapons will close some of the gap, allowing Ukraine to hit further behind Russian lines in Ukraine – in particular allowing it to target command centres – other experts point out that using Himars effectively will rely heavily on the quality of Ukrainian battlefield intelligence.
The promise of Himars represents the 11th US assistance package for Ukraine approved so far and will be the first to tap into the $40bn in security and economic assistance package recently passed by Congress.
The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so their supply would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two.
Philip Breedlove, a retired US Air Force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said Ukraine needed multiple-launch rocket systems.
“These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,” he said. “We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield.”

Under the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme, we have seen many thousands of Britons put their hands up to host Ukrainians fleeing the carnage in their homeland. However, the process to apply has been described by the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, as being “unnecessary, long, [and] bureaucratic”.
The government should realise that there’s more to be gained than the warm fuzzy feeling of a global do-gooder if we prioritise the expedient assistance of as many Ukrainians as possible, as soon as possible.
The combination of EU workers in the UK heading back home post-Brexit, combined with the necessary safety net support provided by the government in the pandemic, has culminated in an unemployment rate of 3.7% in the first quarter of this year. This is the lowest it’s been since 1974, and the first time that there have been fewer unemployed people than job vacancies.
In other words, UK businesses need employees now. And it turns out that there’s an able workforce ready to assist if they could get some help from the Home Office to simplify getting here. They are skilled workers too. In February this year, Ukraine was home to 5,000 IT companies, 290,000 developers, 150 fintech companies, five unicorn companies and startups that had secured $1.68bn (£1.35bn) of funding within the first 11 months of 2021. Before the war, Ukraine was positioning itself as a hub for people adept in digital transformation and business innovation.
Surely prioritising and simplifying the process of applying for a visa for people who are highly skilled and desperately in need of our assistance is therefore a no-brainer?

The Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has become one of the symbols of the brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender.
The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov.
“The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via video link from a company office in Lviv in the west of Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view, the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.”
Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion, and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting.
Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets.
It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”.
Akhmetov, who has links to the UK including past property investments in London, has remained hugely powerful under successive Ukraine administrations, both pro- and anti-Moscow, and has swung behind the current government, saying his allegiance is only to Ukraine and that Russian soldiers should be punished, adding that he would dedicate his wealth to rebuilding the country.
Ryzhenkov says he is in regular contact with Akhmetov as well as the Kyiv government, but insists the company is not involved with the “political issues” of its owner. “We’re working as a single team towards Ukrainian victory.”
Before the war, Azovstal employed 35,000 people, producing 9.5m tonnes of steel a year – two-thirds of Metinvest’s output. That has all stopped. Given the scale of the human lives lost, it can be jarring to talk about quotidian business matters. Ryzhenkov raises an eyebrow when asked what Metinvest’s output will be this year, but responds that it will be down at least 60% compared with 2021.
Yet there has been “help from the market” in the form of strong steel prices, which have lessened the blow to the company’s finances, which were in any case in relatively good shape before the February invasion began, with cash balances high. Ryzhenkov says the company’s focus around Mariupol has now turned to providing temporary food and shelter for more than half of the workforce who have already left the city. Metinvest is running a “humanitarian hub” in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, offering medics and psychological help for adults and children.
Yet he estimates that 50,000 of its employees are still working in the country. Two more blast furnaces in Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kamianske to the north are working at about 50% and 60% capacity respectively, with most products going to European markets or ports. Iron ore mining facilities in Ukraine are operating at around 35% to 40% capacity, and a coking coalmine is at about 75%.
Running a humanitarian operation alongside one of the country’s largest businesses during wartime is not something most chief executives face, but Metinvest has had some preparation. It was forced to move its headquarters from Donetsk after Kremlin-backed separatists first invaded Ukraine’s east in 2014 and turn more towards European markets and non-Russian suppliers for fuel where possible. Then, in the pandemic, it implemented remote working for all eligible staff.
The issue is getting the goods to customers. There has been “quite a significant slowdown in the flow of goods”, Ryzhenkov says. Ukraine and EU governments could step in to provide subsidies for transport, he suggests. The situation for food exports is of particular urgency, not just for Ukrainians, but for poorer consumers of imported wheat around the world.
“It is a big concern,” he says. “Logistics is the key bottleneck right now for many Ukrainian businesses. The government is trying to restart the economy, but without resolving these logistical difficulties, it’s going to be very difficult. We are concerned about the speed at which these bottlenecks are being ‘debottlenecked’.” Reopening Black Sea ports at Mariupol and Odesa is “the key for economy restart”, he adds.
Efforts to increase exports via rail are complicated by the different railway gauges used in Ukraine and Poland, so Metinvest has set up reloading centres in Poland and Slovakia to move products more quickly on to Europe-compatible trains. There is a limit to what can be taken by road, and Ukraine is struggling with severe lack of fuel. Ryzhenkov says government efforts to cap prices have worsened the shortage instead.
From the images of Azovstal’s destruction that filtered out – some of them truly extraordinary – it seems like there cannot be much of it left, but the Metinvest boss cautions that the pictures could be “misleading”, with many showing less important auxiliary units, not the key blast furnaces.
The brutality of the battle for Mariupol has contributed to international isolation of Russia. (Ryzhenkov praised Boris Johnson’s backing for Ukrainian victory, saying the UK prime minister was sending a “very powerful message, and we can hear it and feel it”.) Putin’s apparent aim was to control Ukraine, but the invasion has prompted Metinvest and many other key parts of the economy to turn decisively away from Moscow.
The company is even looking at options to produce more steel in the EU using Ukrainian commodities and Ryzhenkov hopes that Russian steel exports will be targeted by sanctions.
Links with Russia of any kind are off the cards for the “foreseeable future”, he says, and Metinvest will “absolutely not” operate from Russian-controlled territory. “Until [the] Russian regime changes, I don’t see how that can be restored.”"

Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces were suffering up to 100 deaths and 500 wounded every day.
With fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk, western officials suggested that the city of Sloviansk was the likely next target for a Russian advance that has made gains in the past two weeks, even as the Biden administration in the US announced it was sending advanced rocket systems to Kyiv.
Confirming the latest gains in Sievierodonetsk, a strategically important city in Ukraine’s east, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Wednesday that Russia controlled 70% of the city.
“Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” said Haidai. “Some Ukrainian troops have retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions.”
Haidai also said “quite a few” civilians were sheltering in Soviet-era bomb shelters under a chemical plant in the city, although he said the complex was not likely to become the site of a prolonged siege similar to that of the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol.
Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russian forces had struck a tank containing nitric acid at a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant.
The high levels of attrition on the Ukrainian side, whose defenders have been pounded by Russian shelling, was conceded by Zelenskiy in an interview with the US Newsmax TV channel. “The situation is very difficult; we’re losing 60-100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action. So we are holding our defensive perimeters,” he said.
Joe Biden announced the supply of advanced rocket systems, called Himars, and munitions that could strike with precision at long-range Russian targets as part of a $700m (£560m) weapons package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday.
“We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table,” the US president wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times.
Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces continued to hit northern, southern and eastern districts of the city of Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk, one of two provinces in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.
If Russia captures Sievierodonetsk, and its smaller twin Lysychansk on the higher west bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, it will hold all of Luhansk, a key war aim of Vladimir Putin’s forces.
The update added that Russian forces were regrouping and strengthening their positions in preparation for launching a renewed attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk in Donetsk. Russian forces currently occupy Izium, a city north of Sloviansk.
The expected Ukrainian loss of Sievierdonetsk, however, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said, adding that the war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance.
The average gain of Russian forces in Popansa south of Sievierdonetsk has “averaged between 500 metres and one kilometre” a day in the last month, the official added, meaning capturing the remainder of the Donetsk region in the Donbas would take months more at least.
Russia would have to achieve “further challenging operational objectives” to declare victory on the Kremlin’s now reduced campaign terms, the official said.
That would require taking the city of Kramatorsk, and more of the M04 main road between the Ukrainian-held city of Dnipro and the Russian-held city of Donetsk, they added, and more rivers would have to be crossed in the process.
“Although we see Russia is starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas, I think it’s important to stress that the battle for Sievierodonetsk is unlikely to be the kind of the crux of the Donetsk campaign” the official said in a briefing.
The latest fighting in the east came amid predictions from some analysts that Russia may be overstretched in other areas, including around Kherson.
In its daily update, the US-based Institute for the Study of War noted: “Moscow’s concentration on seizing Sievierodonetsk and Donbas generally continues to create vulnerabilities for Russia in Ukraine’s vital Kherson oblast, where Ukrainian counteroffensives continue.
“Kherson is critical terrain because it is the only area of Ukraine in which Russian forces hold ground on the west bank of the Dnipro River.
“If Russia is able to retain a strong lodgement in Kherson when fighting stops, it will be in a very strong position from which to launch a future invasion. If Ukraine regains Kherson, on the other hand, Ukraine will be in a much stronger position to defend itself against future Russian attack.”
However, a recent limited Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kherson appears to have had only limited success so far. An official in southern Ukraine said Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges to obstruct a possible Ukrainian advance.
Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that Ukrainian fighters had seen “some success in the Kherson direction”.
Russia is concentrating most of its military power on trying to capture all of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, also cautioned over how much impact the newly announced US rocket systems might have on the balance of the fighting and how quickly they could be effectively deployed.
We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly 🇺🇦 would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.
Writing on Twitter he said: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.
“Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentary use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.”"

Joe Biden has announced the US will send advanced missile systems to Ukraine. The new weapon is the Himars multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS: a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles.
Both Ukraine and Russia already operate MLRS, but Himars has superior range and precision.
The M142 Himars system (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a modernised, lighter and more agile wheel-mounted version of the track-mounted M270 MLRS developed in the 1970s for US and allied forces.
The Himars that Washington is providing to Ukraine will have a range of about 50 miles (80km), a US official told reporters.
Himars units carry one preloaded pod of six 227mm guided missiles (the M270 carries two pods), or one large pod loaded with an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) tactical missile. The US will not supply Ukraine with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300km.
With a small crew, the Himars can remove a spent pod and load a fresh one in minutes, without other vehicles helping. The crews will require some training.
The US military already has Himars units in Europe; and Nato allies Poland and Romania have acquired the systems.
Himars will give Ukraine’s forces the ability to strike further behind Russian lines, and at distances better protected from Russia’s own long-range weaponry.
The GPS-guided missiles the Himars shoots have a range about double that of the M777 howitzers that the US recently supplied to Ukraine forces.
At roughly 80km it generally puts Himars out of range of Russia’s own artillery, while placing the Russian batteries at risk.
It also could threaten Russian supply depots, amid western belief that the Russian forces suffer logistical problems.
Some analysts have said Himars can be a “game-changer” in the war at a time when Ukraine forces appear to be struggling under Russian artillery fire.
But others say Himars will not suddenly turn the tables. “The Himars would even the playing field,” a senior US defence official said.
The US president wrote in the New York Times that the advanced rockets will enable the Ukrainians “to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine”.
Yet the US plans to limit the range of the missiles it gives Ukraine to avoid them being used to hit targets deep inside Russia.
“We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden said.
Since Russia invaded on 24 February, the US has been sensitive about taking any action to support Kyiv that might provoke Moscow to take the war beyond Ukraine’s borders.
That has included not overtly backing Ukraine strikes inside Russian territory. Several times Ukraine has used its own rockets, drones and helicopters to hit nearby Russian targets in neighbouring Kursk and Belgorod oblasts.
If the US provided ATACMS, they would theoretically have the ability to strike major Russian urban centres and military bases, including airfields from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.
“[The] Ukrainians have given assurances they will not use these systems against Russian territory,” a US official said."

Joe Biden has confirmed he will send more advanced rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region.
The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, according to two senior administration officials. The weapons package will be formally unveiled on Wednesday.
In a New York Times guest essay published on Tuesday, Biden said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will end through diplomacy but the United States must provide significant weapons and ammunition to give Ukraine the highest leverage at the negotiating table.
“That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine,” Biden wrote.
The package also includes ammunition, counter fire radars, a number of air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, as well as anti-armour weapons, officials said.
The move comes after Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk province, said Russian forces had taken control of most of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk amid heavy fighting.
Gaidai reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible. Street fighting is under way, he said, adding: “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block.”
Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling.
He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February.
Sievierodonetsk is important to Russian efforts to capture Donbas before more western arms arrive. The city, which is 90 miles (145km) south of the Russian border, is in an area that is the last pocket under Ukrainian government control in the Luhansk region of Donbas.
The US decision on rocket systems tries to strike a balance between the desire to help Ukraine battle Russian artillery barrages while not providing arms that could allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war.
Biden said on Monday that the US would not send Ukraine “rocket systems that can strike into Russia”. Any weapons system can shoot into Russia if close enough to the border but the aid package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday would send what the US considers medium-range rockets, which can generally can travel about 45 miles (70km), the officials said.
The Ukrainians have assured US officials that they will not fire rockets into Russian territory, according to the senior administration officials. Biden in his Times essay added: “We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.”
The US deal is the 11th package approved so far, and will be the first to tap the $40bn in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take a week or two.
Officials said the plan was to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles (300km).
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with the west to send multiple launch rocket systems. The rockets have a longer range than the howitzer artillery systems the US has already provided. They would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a distance outside the range of Russia’s artillery.
“We are fighting for Ukraine to be provided with all the weapons needed to change the nature of the fighting and start moving faster and more confidently toward the expulsion of the occupiers,” Zelenskiy said in a recent address.
Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the west against sending greater firepower to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call on Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of western weapons.

Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.”
US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US.
Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.”
President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region.
The UK’s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.”
Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children’s Day.
Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries.
Switzerland’s government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato.
Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”.
Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”.
The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued.
Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague.
A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow.
Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business.
Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU’s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports.

Russian forces have taken control of most of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk but have not surrounded it, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk province has said as heavy fighting continued in and around the key city and civilians were told to stay underground.
Serhiy Gaidai said in an online post late on Tuesday that Russian shelling had made it impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies or evacuate people.
Earlier, the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible.
“Half of the city has been captured by the Russians and fierce street fighting is under way,” Striuk said. “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block.
“The Ukrainian military continues to resist this frenzied push and aggression by Russian forces. Unfortunately … the city has been split in half. But at the same time the city still defends itself. It is still Ukrainian,” he said, advising those still trapped inside to stay in cellars.
Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling.
He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February. “Civilians are dying from direct strikes, from fragmentation wounds and under the rubble of destroyed buildings, since most of the inhabitants are hiding in basements and shelters,” he said.
The leader of the pro-Moscow self-proclaimed republic of Luhansk earlier admitted that Russian and pro-Moscow forces were moving more slowly than they hoped. “We can say already that a third of Sievierodonetsk is already under our control,” Russia’s Tass state news agency quoted Leonid Pasechnik as saying.
Amid mounting concern for the civilians still trapped in the city Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency, which had long operated out of Sievierodonetsk, said he was “horrified” by its destruction.
“We fear that up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire in the city, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity. The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape.”
The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, on Tuesday evening reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike had hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings.
Elsewhere on the battlefield, there were few reports of major action on Tuesday.
In the east, Ukraine says Moscow is trying to assault other areas along the main front, including pressing towards the city of Sloviansk.
In the south, Ukraine claimed in recent days to have pushed back Russian forces on a bank of the Inhulets River that forms a border of Russian-held Kherson province.
After having failed to capture Kyiv, been driven out of northern Ukraine and made only limited progress elsewhere in the east, Moscow has concentrated the full force of its armed might in recent days on Sievierodonetsk.
Victory there and in adjoining Lysychansk would let Moscow claim control of Luhansk province, one of two eastern regions it claims on behalf of separatist proxies, partly achieving one of President Vladimir Putin’s stated war aims.
But the huge battle has come at a massive cost, which some western military experts say could hurt Russia’s ability to fend off eventual Ukrainian counterattacks elsewhere, regardless of who wins the battle for Sievierodonetsk.
“Putin is now hurling men and munitions at the last remaining major population centre in [Luhansk], Sievierodonetsk, as if taking it would win the war for the Kremlin. He is wrong,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank wrote this week.
“When the Battle of Sievierodonetsk ends, regardless of which side holds the city, the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will likely have culminated, giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back.”
The latest fighting came as Russia said on Tuesday that it will hand over the bodies of 152 Ukrainian soldiers found underneath the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, now under Moscow’s control.
Russia’s defence ministry said its troops found “152 bodies of dead militants and servicemen of Ukraine’s armed forces” that it claims were stored inside a cooling unit and that “four mines” were found underneath the bodies.
“The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian militants and servicemen found on the territory of the Azovstal plant to representatives in Ukraine,” the ministry added.

Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe, after state energy giant Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany.
The intensification of the economic battle on Tuesday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows the EU’s overnight decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports as part of its financial sanctions against the Kremlin.
EU leaders said the ban would immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
Gazprom extended its gas cuts on Tuesday by stopping supply to GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government.
It later said it would also cut off gas flows to the Danish energy firm Ørsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles.
GasTerra said it had found contracts elsewhere for the supply of the 2bn cubic metres of gas it had been expecting to receive from Gazprom between now and October.
Ahead of the late-night talks in Brussels, Denmark had signalled it expected its Russian gas supply to end. However, Ørsted said on Monday that a gas cut would not immediately put the country’s gas supplies at risk.
Moscow has already halted supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria, Poland and Finland, after they refused to pay in Russian roubles.
Gazprom said it had been told by Shell Energy Europe Limited that it would not pay in roubles for gas supplied to Germany. It added that the contract stipulated gas supplies of up to 1.2bn cubic metres per year.
Gazprom said Shell and Ørsted had failed to pay for gas deliveries by the end of the working day on May 31, and would stop deliveries until they paid in line with Russian demands.
The Kremlin had demanded payments for exports in roubles earlier in the spring, after the country’s currency fell off a cliff after the invasion of Ukraine and Russia was excluded from the Swift international bank messaging system in earlier rounds of sanctions.
The EU’s energy commissioner had previously said that member states would have to reject Moscow’s demands, as the mechanism set out by Russia would have breached the bloc’s sanctions, even if this left them without alternative gas supply.
Supply cuts have pushed already high gas prices even higher, contributing to soaring inflation, and also putting pressure on European governments and companies to find alternative supplies and infrastructure, including storage facilities.
The EU has faced criticism over the past weeks for not going far enough in its sanctions against Russia. Ahead of Monday’s summit in Brussels, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin.
Under a compromise plan from the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for use by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.
Despite this agreement, Estonia’s prime minister has called on the EU to go further and work on a seventh round of sanctions against Russia, which would include restrictions on gas imports.
However, Kaja Kallas said she was not confident this would happen. “I think that gas has to be in the seventh package but I am realistic as well,” Kallas told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks in Brussels. “I don’t think it will be there.”"

An airstrike has hit a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, a city in east Ukraine, Ukrainian officials wrote on Telegram late on Tuesday. Residents were urged not to come out of hiding due to toxic fumes.
Ukraine welcomed EU sanctions, but criticised the “unacceptable” delay. Speaking alongside Slovakia’s president, Zuzana Čaputová, in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, noted that 50 days have passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages.

In an interview late on Monday, Oleg Morozov, first elected to the Russian parliament in 1993 and a member of the dominant United Russia party, said on Rossiya-1 state TV he has a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister will travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow.
Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president Dmitry Medvedev has claimed. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security matters, said in a post on Telegram on Tuesday that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have incurred losses for big business.
Ukraine is still in control of some parts of Sievierodonetsk city. Its soldiers are fighting slowly advancing Russian troops, but civilian evacuations are not currently possible, the head of the city’s administration has said. Russians now control “around half”, according to reports on national television in Ukraine."

EU leaders suggested Russian gas was unlikely to be part of the next round of sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine, hours after agreeing a historic but incomplete oil embargo.
After nearly a month of wrangling, the EU agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year, with an exemption for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. These landlocked central European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil, can continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for an indeterminate period.
Following the oil embargo, a measure that would have been unthinkable six months ago, Baltic leaders called for talks on further sanctions. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said the EU needed to start discussing its next sanctions against Russia because things were “not going any better” in Ukraine. “As long as the war is going on, there is no peace, Ukraine hasn’t won the war; we haven’t done enough.”
The Estonian PM, like her counterparts in the Baltic states and Poland, wants the EU to phase out Russian gas quickly. But Kallas said she was “realistic” and did not expect to see gas in the next set of sanctions. “Gas is of course much more difficult than oil already was,” she told reporters on the second day of an EU summit. “All the next sanctions will be more difficult, because so far they have only hurt Russians, but now they are also having effects on Europeans and that is why it is also much more politically difficult to decide.”
Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said gas could not be part of the EU’s next set of sanctions. “Russian oil is much easier to compensate [for] … gas is completely different, which is why a gas embargo will not be an issue in the next sanctions package,” he said.
The oil embargo was agreed at a special EU summit on Monday, after Hungary gained a guarantee that it could get access to seaborne oil, if Russian supplies via the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through war-torn Ukraine, were cut off.
In a message on Facebook, Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, said he had secured an exemption from the oil embargo that he likened to an “atomic bomb” hitting the Hungarian economy.
“Families can sleep peacefully tonight, we kept out the most hair-raising idea,” Orbán said.
EU leaders played down the row with Hungary, currently embroiled in a long-running stand-off with Brussels over the rule of law and its access to EU cash. “The important thing is that we are all together, we are united,” said Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš.
The Ukrainian foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed the partial block on Russian oil imports. “The oil embargo will speed up the countdown to the collapse of the Russian economy and war machine,” Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement, estimating the ban could cost Russia tens of billions of dollars.
He praised the EU for “not only making it harder for the Kremlin to finance the aggression but also shoring up its own energy security”, though a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier given a withering assessment of EU support for his country. “Russia must not win, but we won’t give heavy weapons – it may offend [Russia]. Putin must lose, but let’s not impose new sanctions. Millions will starve, but we’re not ready for military convoys with grain. Rising prices are not the worst that awaits a democratic world with such a policy,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.
Zelenskiy addressed EU leaders by video link on Monday, urging them to unite because disputes “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”.
Ending the dispute over the oil embargo allows the EU to move ahead with other restrictions in the package, targeting Russian banks and individuals close to the Kremlin. Three more Russian banks, including the country’s largest lender, Sberbank, are to be removed from the Swift international bank messaging system, a move that isolates them from global finance. Three state-owned broadcasters will be banned from the EU.
The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the sanctions agreement – “late as always … but a reasonable way out of the discussion”. He predicted that Russia would be forced to lower the price of its oil. “We are the most important client for Russia. They will have to look for another one and certainly they will have to decrease the price.” Some economists have suggested, however, that Russia could gain in the short-term rising prices caused by the oil embargo.
At the start of the war, the EU was paying Russia around €1bn a day for energy imports. The bloc has now agreed to phase out coal by mid-August, and most oil by the end of the year, but has not set a date for gas.
EU leaders also suggested energy sanctions had gone far enough, arguing that gas was already dealt with under a European Commission plan on phasing out Russian fossil fuels. Known in Brussels as RepowerEU, that plan calls for an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for ending Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to renewable power.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters that Russian fossil fuels had been “clearly addressed” by a coming ban on coal, oil and the RepowerEU plan. “The big bulk on energy this is up and running,” she said.
Asked about further sanctions, she said it was important to tackle attempts by Russia to circumvent EU energy and financial sanctions. “Therefore, I would not exclude that over and over we have to address the situation that we close loopholes.
“These sanctions are biting hard and are really destroying … the financial basis of Putin leading this war,” she said."

In the lead-up to this week’s European Union summit in Brussels, Germany’s economy minister and deputy chancellor, Robert Habeck, warned that unity over sanctions on Russia was “starting to crumble”. If that assessment was intended to galvanise EU leaders at a crucial moment, it appears to have just about done its job.
The partial embargo on Russian oil imports agreed at the summit on Monday night constitutes a significant, if belated, ratcheting up of economic pressure on Vladimir Putin’s regime. After a month of negotiations between member states, objections from Hungary were finally overcome through a temporary exemption for oil transported through a Soviet-era pipeline to central Europe. Given that Germany and Poland will forgo imports from this source, by the end of the year the embargo should cover over 90% of Russian oil supplies to Europe. The effect of the ban over time, and combined with other sanctions, will be to deprive Moscow of funds and means to prosecute a prolonged war of attrition that it did not anticipate having to fight.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, was therefore justified in describing the oil embargo as a show of unity and a “landmark” agreement. An announcement of €9bn in economic aid to Ukraine was also welcome, although it should only be seen as a start. The Kyiv School of Economics has calculated that the war is causing about $4.5bn worth of damage to civilian infrastructure every week. The costs of postwar reconstruction could run into hundreds of billions of dollars.
However, financing that colossal challenge is tomorrow’s task. In the shorter term – as it attempts to intensify the financial squeeze on Mr Putin – the west must give Ukraine the military assistance it needs to resist Russian forces, while continuing to avoid moves that risk escalating and widening the war. In May, Washington committed to a $40bn package to aid Ukraine’s war effort, and the supply of US weapons is accelerating – including vital artillery capability. European countries need to up the pace of their own contributions, as the Kremlin attempts to concentrate overwhelming force in the east and annexe new territory. But the US president, Joe Biden, was right this week to rule out sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine which could be deployed to hit targets inside Russia. Moscow’s nuclear capability – and the threatening rhetoric intermittently deployed in relation to it – must necessarily inform the west’s strategic calculations, however enraging that may be.
The goal, as Mr Putin’s appalling war of choice continues, must be that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people are enabled to negotiate its end from a position of strength and dignity. If this is to be achieved, it will be through a combination of economic pressure on Moscow and military resistance. Russia’s armed forces are being steadily and damagingly depleted, even as incremental territorial gains are made. Around 1,000 tanks may have been lost on the battlefield, while two of Russia’s tank manufacturers have reportedly ceased production due to a lack of parts.
Thus far, Mr Putin has shown total disregard for the human cost of his invasion, now measured in tens of thousands of lost lives. But the cumulative impact of sanctions can set logistical limits to his brutal revanchist ambitions. This week’s oil embargo is an important step in that direction."

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/plea-for-heavy-weapons-ukraine-frontline-mykolaiv;2022-05-31;‘The west can change the outcome’: plea for heavy weapons on Ukraine frontline;"People under constant fire in southern city of Mykolaiv say they can beat Russia with more help
A stack of deadly weapons line the corridor next to Roman Kostenko’s office in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. Giant tube-like Javelin missiles and a powerful-looking green cylinder. “That’s an NLAW anti-tank weapon supplied by Britain,” Kostenko – a member of Ukraine’s parliament and a special forces commander – explained. “We’ve used it.”
When Russia invaded on 24 February, Kostenko was in Kyiv. He swapped his politician’s outfit of suit and tie for a uniform and hurried to Mykolaiv on the southern frontline. By this point Russian troops had practically encircled the city and its port on the Bug River. They had seized Mykolaiv’s airport and were advancing from the north-east. “I was the last car in,” he said.
Citizens were piling up tyres and making molotov cocktails in preparation for street-to-street fighting. The Ukrainian army, however, managed to push the Russians back. Kostenko showed off a video he took of a Russian position on Mykolaiv’s outskirts. There were bodies of enemy soldiers killed in a Ukrainian artillery strike, as well as abandoned field guns and vehicles.
Since this failed incursion the fighting has turned into a “war of rockets and artillery”, Kostenko said. The frontline in the south runs approximately along the administrative border between Russian-occupied Kherson oblast and Mykolaiv, 12 miles (20km) to the north. It is a shimmering landscape of green wheat fields and steppe villages, now under constant fire.
Russian howitzers are able to target Mykolaiv with ease. On Saturday a missile smashed into a residential block in the city, killing one person and injuring seven. The Ukrainians lack long-range rocket systems that would enable them to fire back, as well as defensive anti-aircraft batteries, Kostenko said. In the meantime they sit in makeshift trenches under fire.
“To survive artillery hitting you 24/7 is very hard,” Kostenko added. The Javelins sent by the US were ineffective because the Russians hid their armoured vehicles in a network of Soviet-era irrigation canals, he explained. “Our anti-tank weapons don’t see them. If our partners give us heavy artillery and advanced systems like MRLS [multiple-launch rocket systems] we can win and take back occupied territory.”
For now, Ukrainian soldiers are only able to make local tactical gains. On Monday they retook a village in north-east Kherson. Kostenko said Russia had plenty of tanks and supplies of ammunition left. The fighting in the south, and in the east where a battle is raging for the city of Sievierodonetsk, resembled the second world war with modern weapons, he said. The Russians, he admitted, had the advantage.
The MP, secretary of the national security, defence and intelligence committee, spent 15 years as a soldier. He was wounded twice in late 2014 while fighting at the airport in Donetsk against the Russians and their separatist proxies. He grew up in a village outside Kherson now controlled by Moscow, where Russian soldiers broke into his parents’ house, looted his parade uniform and took away all of the furniture, he said.
Kostenko suggested Vladimir Putin’s goal was to seize the Donbas and annex Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, making it a “non-sea country”, after he had failed in his original goal of toppling Kyiv’s government to return Ukraine to Russian influence and to demonstrate Moscow’s military invincibility.
A member of the liberal pro-European Golos party, he praised the UK, US and Poland: “We love Boris Johnson. Britain is a country which has clearly stated its position. It stands by its values. It is not afraid of the Russia Federation. We have several British volunteers who are fighting with us. The whole civilised world is fighting Russia, not just Ukraine.”
He was less enthusiastic about Germany and France. “Some of our partners are behaving very cautiously. It’s inexplicable. They are not calling out the enemy. We are fighting totalitarianism,” an exasperated Kostenko said.
Mykolaiv’s inhabitants, meanwhile, have got used to thunderous booms, which shake the city on an hourly basis. For more than a month there was no water after a pipeline was destroyed. Last week a supply for washing was finally reconnected. There is no drinking water. It is delivered to the city, a major shipbuilding centre in USSR times, in large plastic bottles. About 40% of its population have left.
A humanitarian aid point has been set up in a crumbling 200-year-old theatre and concert hall once used by naval officers. There are supplies of clothes, shoes and medicines. Residents fill in a form explaining what they need. Viktoria Veselovska, a journalist working in a pop-up basement pharmacy, said she had no mosquito repellant. “Insects are a big problem for our soldiers,” she said.
Morale among those who have decided to remain in shell-battered Mykolaiv appears high. Olga Pidsosonna, a volunteer and major in the port’s customs department, described the war as “one very long bad day”. “Russia is trying to eat us. But it will break its teeth. We are a very strong nation. I’m proud to be Ukrainian and I’m proud of our army and our volunteers,” she said.
In peacetime 10 cargo ships a day would leave Mykolaiv’s harbour, she said. Most exported grain. Russia’s naval blockade of the Black Sea meant the port was inoperative. A Ukrainian victory should include Crimea, “stolen by the Kremlin in 2014”, Pidsosonna said, adding: “I have relatives in Crimea. They want to be back with Ukraine. They can’t say this openly, of course. They are afraid.”
Few people in this city of half a million expected to find themselves living in an old-school war zone. One person not surprised by how 2022 turned out was Makar Kostiuk, a student from Vladivostok. Kostiuk volunteered in the local office of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. He left the country for Ukraine before Navalny was arrested and jailed.
“When the bombs started falling I was working on my second novel. The explosions made me type faster,” Kostiuk said. Shrapnel landed in his courtyard, punching a hole in the glass on the stairwell. Kostiuk said he had not encountered any anti-Russian prejudice. But his bank cards had been blocked and he was likely to have to leave Ukraine in the summer when his residency permit ran out.
Many shops on Mykolaiv’s main street, Sobornaya, were boarded up. Tinned music played from loudspeakers attached to maple trees. A few people were out shopping and a man in Lycra rode past on his mountain bike. A lot of destruction was visible. An airdropped bomb had flattened the Ingul hotel. In March the Russians fired a cruise missile at the regional administration building, killing 12 and wounding 33.
Nobody knows when the Ukrainian army will be able to take back Kherson, which was overrun in the first days of the invasion. The Kremlin says the area now belongs to Russia. It recently prohibited residents from fleeing and has mined the road leading to Mykolaiv. Plans to hold a “referendum” on joining Moscow have been put on hold because of a lack of public support. “Ninety-nine per cent of the country does not want Russia,” the MP said.
Kostenko gave the Guardian a souvenir: a jagged fragment from a Russian Kalibr warhead, which he wrapped up carefully in kitchen roll. “Victory now depends on our international friends,” he said. “We have plenty of kalashnikovs and machine guns. If we get enough heavy arms Russia will not be able to go any further.” He stressed: “The west can change the outcome of this war.”"

The African Union has warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risks “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises.
Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continue.
Speaking via video link to the 27 EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Sall said African countries had been hit hard by the global food crisis, because of their “strong dependence” on Russian and Ukrainian wheat. The situation was “worrying” for a continent that has 282 million people that did not get enough to eat, he said.
“In the immediate future, we would like everything to be done to release available grain stocks and ensure transport and access to the market, to avoid a catastrophic scenario of shortages and generalised high prices,” Sall said.
Before the war, African countries imported 44% of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine alone grew enough food for 400 million people.
Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports is contributing to what analysts have called a “perfect storm” for global food supplies, as farmers face rising oil and fertiliser costs and the lingering effect of coronavirus labour restrictions. Drought is also threatening to reduce wheat harvests in countries including France, the US and India.
Proposals to end the blockade have been made. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that he and the German chancellor had put to Vladimir Putin ending the blockade under the terms of a UN resolution. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov will visit next week for talks to address among other things opening a Black Sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports.
The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, warned earlier this month that nearly 49 million people in 43 countries were on the edge of famine. “In many countries we are forced to make the heartbreaking decision to take food from hungry children to give it to starving children,” he said.
Sall said the price of fertiliser was now three times higher than in 2021, while cereal yields in Africa were forecast to be 20-50% lower this year.
He also blamed EU sanctions on Russian banks for exacerbating the problem: “When the Swift system is disturbed, this means that even if the products exist, payment becomes more complicated, even impossible.”
The EU has cut some of Russia’s largest banks out of the Belgian-headquartered Swift interbank messaging system, making it almost impossible to do business with them.
The African Union leader said he supported proposals for the UN to coordinate efforts to release supplies from Ukrainian ports.
Lithuania has proposed that a naval “coalition of the willing” should lift the Black Sea blockade. Under the Lithuanian plan, the UN would call on Russia to ensure safe passage for ships and Ukraine to remove mines from the port of Odesa, a defensive measure to protect the strategic site.
After the talks with Sall, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted: “Russia is using food as weapon of war. Destroying crops, blocking tonnes of grain, risking global famine. EU is sparing no efforts to free Ukraine’s exports over land and exploring alternative sea routes.”
And in a press conference, Michel said opening the Black Sea maritime route “should be the first priority … but we are not certain it will work”.
The European Commission wants to get 20m tonnes of wheat out of Ukraine before the end of July, half of the amount currently stuck in the country. But finding alternatives to sea transport is a huge logistical challenge, as trucks and trains cannot take the same quantity of goods, and face an average wait of 16 days to cross the EU border.
The EU is attempting to help firms create alternative routes, so-called “solidarity lanes”, but senior EU officials have described this as a “gigantic” task. The EU transport commissioner, Adina Vǎlean, said earlier this month that “an astonishing 10,000 barges and almost 300 large ships are needed to carry 20m tonnes of grains” if it is to be exported via alternative EU ports.
Some EU diplomats believe Russia wants to add fuel to the fire of a global food crisis, with the aim of stoking a wave of migration from the Middle East and Africa that could destabilise European countries.
Moscow has blamed the global food crisis on western sanctions. Lavrov, said on Tuesday his country would guarantee “free export of Ukraine grain by ships that are now locked in Ukrainian ports” if Ukraine removed mines from its coastal waters.
He said western countries had created “a flurry of artificial problems” by closing their ports to Russian vessels, a sanction passed by the EU and the UK."

Two Russian soldiers have each been sentenced to more than 11 years in jail after a court in central Ukraine found them guilty of firing artillery at civilian areas.
The verdict after the trial in the Poltava region came one week after another court in the capital, Kyiv, gave a 21-year-old Russian soldier a life sentence – the country’s first judicial reckoning on Russia’s invasion.
The servicemen convicted on Tuesday, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, were handed sentences of 11 years and six months under legislation against “violating the laws and customs of war”.
They were found guilty of firing Grad missiles on two villages in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in the early days of the war. The Interfax news agency reported that both previously pleaded guilty.
It said their legal defence had requested a more lenient sentence, claiming the soldiers had been following orders and acting under duress.
The verdicts this month against Russian servicemen are expected to be the first in a wave of trials. Ukraine says it has already opened thousands of war crime investigations since the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sent in his troops.
Rights organisations have voiced hope that Ukraine’s trials of Russian soldiers will be impartial and transparent. After the conviction in Kyiv of 21-year-old Vadim Shishimarin, the Kremlin said it had not received any information about his case while his trial was under way. Ukrainian lawyers representing the Russian servicemen say they have not been in contact with legal or military officials in Moscow.
Ukraine has identified several thousand suspected war crimes in the eastern Donbas region where Russian forces are pressing their offensive, Kyiv’s chief prosecutor separately said on Tuesday.
“Of course we started a few thousand cases about what we see in Donbas,” the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, told a news conference in The Hague as she met international counterparts.
“If we speak about war crimes, it’s about possible transfer of people; we started several cases about possible transfer of children, adult people to different parts of the Russian Federation,” she said. “Then, of course, we can speak about torturing people, killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure.”
Ukrainian authorities did not have access to Russian-held areas of Donbas but they were interviewing evacuees and prisoners of war, Venediktova told the press conference at the headquarters of the EU judicial agency, Eurojust.
In total, Ukraine had identified 15,000 war crimes cases across the country since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, she added.
Ukraine had identified 600 suspects for the “anchor” crime of aggression, including “high level of top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russian Federation”, the prosecutor general said.
Nearly 80 suspects had been identified for alleged war crimes that had actually taken place on Ukrainian soil, she added."

The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives.
With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue.
While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric.
The Russian tactics that have shaped the battle in the Donbas have also posed a brutal dilemma for Ukraine’s defenders – to hold their ground amid rapidly mounting casualties, or withdraw and risk giving the attackers momentum.
While other parts of the 300-mile frontline in Ukraine’s east lack some of the same vulnerabilities that existed around Sievierodonetsk – which sat in the midst of a Ukrainian salient that Russia exploited – in any future offensive the Kremlin is likely to offer Kyiv the same hard choices, attempting to stretch its ability to respond.
Perhaps the first and most pressing issue – if and when Russian forces fully take Sievierodonetsk – is whether they then attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, after disastrous attempts at crossing elsewhere were targeted by Ukrainian artillery with deadly effect.
Whether or not Russian forces attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River – a natural barrier – at Sievierodonetsk or elsewhere within Ukraine, Russian forces appear to be preparing for a fresh push farther north amid evidence that they are regrouping near the Ukrainian town of Izium to renew their stalled efforts against Slovyansk, rebuilding a railway bridge near Kupyansk to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment to the area.
What is more difficult to assess is the level of attrition inflicted on both sides, and what impact that will have on further offensives and Ukraine’s ability to defend and counterattack.
While the UK’s Ministry of Defence has made much of Russian losses throughout the war – most recently the mounting casualties among junior officers – Russian gains in the Donbas appear to tell a different story, for now at least. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that Ukraine has suffered heavy casualties during recent fighting in the east, largely from shrapnel, and there are reports of equipment and supply issues.
What may well be true is that despite evidence of fresh Russian preparations, the difficulty of the fighting and heavy losses may limit Russia’s ambitions beyond controlling the Donbas, the south and its key coastline.
“After almost a hundred days of war,” Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute wrote in the Times earlier this week, “the Russian offensive in Ukraine is finally beginning to look more coherent, if not yet strategically wise or sustainable.”
Predicting a prolonged war, however, the former Australian general Mick Ryan disputed the notion that either Russia or Ukraine was close to exhaustion in a lengthy Twitter thread examining the current military position and likely trajectory.
“In April and early May, after Ukraine’s victory in the battle of Kyiv, a degree of triumphalism crept into Ukraine war narratives. But as the Russians have shown recently, by concentrating their forces on smaller regions of Ukraine, they can generate tactical victories,” he said.
“Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow against the other. Despite the Ukrainians demonstrating superiority in global influence, strategy and leadership, the Russians keep generating the combat power to attack them in the east.
“Despite the Russians and Ukrainians losing people and equipment in the hundreds (if not thousands), neither are exhausted nations. The Russians have reserves of manpower and equipment in storage. Ukraine has masses of military aid flowing across its borders.”
In spite of continuing Russian shelling around Kharkiv and in the south around Kherson, where two limited Ukrainian counteroffensives have stalled, the Russian objective in both those areas – according to the Ukrainian general staff – is to consolidate defences and supply lines and to disrupt Ukrainian forces where they have managed to advance.
Elsewhere, however, as the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War suggests: “Russian advances remain limited and are unlikely to increase in pace in the near term, particularly as Russian forces continue to prioritise assaults on Sievierodonetsk at the cost of other lines of effort.”"

The lead singer of the German hard rockers Scorpions has revealed he changed the lyrics of Wind of Change because he no longer wanted to “romanticise Russia” with his chart-topping perestroika power ballad, after Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine.
“To sing Wind of Change as we have always sung it, that’s not something I could imagine any more,” Klaus Meine told Die Zeit. “It simply isn’t right to romanticise Russia with lyrics like: ‘I follow the Moskva / Down to Gorky Park … Let your balalaika sing’”.
Instead, he said, his band had decided to change the words to their most famous song during their ongoing US and European tour, which opened in Las Vegas on 26 March, a month after the start of the invasion.
The revised lyrics, projected on to a screen behind the band, say: “Now listen to my heart / It says Ukrainia / Waiting for the wind to change.”
Even though the song was released over a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in December 1990, it is widely remembered as the soundtrack to the era of economic and social changes in the former Soviet Union that heralded the end of the cold war.
Scorpions performed Wind of Change at the Brandenburg Gate on the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1999, and it was voted song of the 20th century by viewers of the public broadcaster ZDF in 2005.
Meine, who wrote the music and lyrics for the hard rock band’s uncharacteristic ballad, said he composed the words on 3 and 4 September 1989, after Scorpions had performed at the Moscow Music Peace festival in mid-August.
More recently, Wind of Change was the subject of a playful eight-part podcast series in which the investigative journalist Patrick Radden Keefe tried to chase down a rumour that the anthem had in fact been written by the CIA, without unearthing any substantial evidence for the theory. In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine again denied that his most successful song had been written by US propaganda officers.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Germany’s political establishment has faced criticism that it has spent too long buying into the implicit premise of Scorpions’ chart-topper, of a Russia ever ushered down a road of democratisation as it opened routes of trade and diplomatic exchange with the west. The threats an increasingly aggressive Kremlin continued to pose to the states that once made up its empire, critics allege, were overlooked in Berlin for decades.
In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine denied that his band, too, had overlooked Ukraine’s plight, pointing out Scorpions had played concerts in Donetsk, Kharkiv and Odesa.
“But as a musician you hold on to the thought that people in wildly different countries, some of whom may look on each other as enemies, react to music in the same way. That was also the case in Ukraine and Russia.”
Hailing from Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony in north-west Germany, the band used to be seen as part of the friendship circle of the Hanoverian ex-chancellor turned Russian gas lobbyist Gerhard Schröder, whose fifth wedding party Meine attended in 2018.
“I haven’t spoken with Gerhard Schröder for a while,” Meine told Die Zeit. “But his behaviour really is hard to understand.” The Social Democrat politician held on to his boardroom post with Rosneft for the first three months of the war before the Russian state-owned oil company announced his stepping down on 20 May.
“If he now gives up this post on the supervisory board, then that is a genuine step in the right direction after a long time,” Meine said."

A consortium of Ukrainian and international lawyers is preparing to launch a mass civil legal action against the Russian state, as well as private military contractors and businesspeople backing the Russian war effort, in an attempt to gain financial compensation for millions of Ukrainian victims of the war, the Guardian can reveal.
The team, made up of hundreds of lawyers and several major law firms, plans to bring “multiple actions in different jurisdictions against different targets”, including the UK and the US, said Jason McCue, a London-based lawyer who is coordinating the initiative, in an interview in Kyiv.
The plan is to use UK and US judgments to seize Russian assets across the globe.
Targets are likely to include the Russian state and private military contractors such as the Wagner Group, which is believed to have been active in Ukraine. But McCue said they would also include business figures linked to these contractors, and to the Russian war effort more broadly. He believes that it will be possible to go after assets that have already been hit by sanctions as well as those that have not.
The class action will be a private case, independent of the Ukrainian state. But according to McCue, they will need access to Ukraine’s evidence and intelligence.
The Ukrainian MP and businessman Serhiy Taruta is supporting the initiative by facilitating meetings for the lawyers and investigators with Ukrainian officials.
Taruta, who is from Mariupol and had investments in the city, lost a large chunk of his business when Russia and its proxy forces took more than half of the Donbas region in 2014. This time he lost friends, colleagues and a cousin as Russia destroyed Mariupol while attempting to occupy it.
“Ukrainians have waited 20 years for the prosecution of [Pavlo] Lazarenko, and now eight for MH17,” said Taruta, referring to a case against Ukraine’s former prime minister who embezzled millions, and to an ongoing case in The Hague over the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight in 2014.
“We need to develop a quicker mechanism [for compensation],” said Taruta. “The normal routes are too slow.”
Ukraine has already begun prosecuting captured Russian soldiers for war crimes in criminal cases, and other war crime cases may later be tried in international courts. But claims for reparations for the war damage are trickier, and McCue said part of the idea behind speedily launching the case was because reparations on a state-to-state level are rarely possible.
“Often when it gets to the negotiations, the issue of reparations is put to one side to focus on the sustainability of peace,” he said.
According to Taruta, individuals who have suffered the loss of a loved one or property or who have been injured will be the primary recipients of the compensation, followed by state and local institutions, and only then businesses. He estimated the total potential claim could be no less than $1tn (£793.9bn).
A number of teams of investigators have come on board to help the team find assets of businesspeople they believe to be complicit in Russia’s war effort. They include Bellingcat, which has been investigating the activities of the Wagner Group and other Russian private military contractors for some years.
“We are closely monitoring the activity of Russia’s mercenary units in Ukraine,” said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat’s executive director.
“We believe that a deep dive into the [Wagner Group’s] chain of command and its links to official Russian authorities would not only help bring justice for the victims and their families, but also will bring more public awareness and transparency on how Russia is conducting this war,” said Grozev.
A key part of the case will involve pleading that Russia’s invasion is not just an aggressive war but also falls at least partially under the legal definition of terrorism, which would make it easier to go after assets.
“All the legal teams from different countries are satisfied that we have what we need,” said McCue. “It’s very solid.”
McCue has extensive experience in similar cases on a smaller scale, the first of which was won on behalf of victims of the 1998 Omagh bombing, in which four men were found liable for the bombing and ordered to pay compensation to families of the victims.
“The evidence was with the police but nobody was prosecuting because of the peace process,” said McCue, who described how the families approached him. “So, we did a civil action, and we won, and we managed to take houses off two of them.”
The Ukraine case, which is much bigger in scale, is likely to operate on similar principles, though it will be more focused on winning financial compensation for people who have suffered the loss of their loved ones, property or businesses.
“The Omagh case wasn’t about money, it was about proving who did it. This case is about money,” said McCue.
He conceded that there would be enormous work ahead to verify and rank cases and create a “victim hierarchy”, and that targeted figures were likely to work hard to move or cover up their assets. However, he said he believed the case had a good chance of succeeding.
“What we know is that if we don’t do this, people are less likely to get something. This increases the chances,” he said."

Mongolia, a squeezed outpost of democracy in north-east Asia, is under renewed pressure from its authoritarian neighbours, Russia and China, to shed its independence and form a triangle of anti-western cooperation in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
The country is doggedly pursuing a path of neutrality, coupled with a policy of economic diversification designed to keep its unique culture and still relatively recent independence alive, according to Nomin Chinbat, its culture secretary.
A Soviet satellite state until 1990, and heavily dependent on China as a market and conduit for its copper and coal exports, Mongolia has to tread carefully. It is three times the size of France but has a population of only 3.5 million, half of whom live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.
So far it has dodged a definitive position on Ukraine by abstaining in major UN votes. However, its governing Mongolian People’s party is attending briefings given by United Russia, the biggest party in Russia – which has been interpreted in Russia as support for the war.
Doubtless all this is a disappointment to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, who spent four of his childhood years in the Mongolian town of Erdenet as the son of a Soviet mining specialist.
Chinbat, a graduate of the University of East Anglia, is a model of diplomacy when she points out the term ambassador was invented in Mongolia. “Abstaining was a decision that our country had to make because of our geopolitical location,” she said. “We have had very healthy and manageable relationships with our two neighbours, but we also have a third neighbour policy that allows us to develop a multi-pillar international relationships with other countries.
“We have survived where we are, and our sovereignty has been respected by our neighbours. But democracy is what will keep us developing further.”
Chinbat, who has been tasked with attracting foreign investment to her country – whether from film-makers, industrialists or tourists – said there had been a generational shift among Mongolians, over 60% of whom are under 35. The outlook of younger people, she said, is less defined by relations with the country’s neighbours and more by Mongolia’s own development.
Nevertheless, if there is a prolonged war Mongolia’s ultimate political orientation may once again be up for grabs, especially if China and Russia genuinely form the long-discussed anti-western alliance, making it harder for Mongolia to play its two powerful neighbours off one another.
One path for the country is to form the third part of a Russian-Chinese triangle, largely becoming a transport hub between the two superpowers, and supplier of raw materials, while the other option is to try to acknowledge the two countries’ economic importance, while exploiting Mongolia’s own mineral resources to diversify the economy and modernise. The visit in May of the UK Asia minister, Amanda Milling, is a sign that Britain and the US will try to coax it along the latter course.
Some claim Mongolia in reality has already chosen the Sino-Russian option, since four days after the invasion it signed a memorandum of understanding to press ahead with the long-planned trans-Mongolian gas pipeline deal. This pipeline would increase Mongolia’s dependence on Russia by taking gas from Siberia’s Yamal fields and allowing Russia to transport gas originally destined for Europe to find a new market in China.
As a landlocked country, its vulnerability to China has been exposed by the prolonged Chinese border closures caused by Covid, slowing a planned rise in Mongolian energy exports to Chinese ports due to be enabled by a network of new freight lines that will cut journey times by a third.
Chinbat said the government had invested heavily in a wider economic policy of privatisation, tourism, climate and rural development policies, which will allow it to diversify its economy over the next 20 years. The plan needs to succeed: in April, young people took to the streets to protest against the impact of inflation on their lives.
Once in charge of one of her country’s largest independent broadcasters, Chinbat said Mongolia would not backslide from democracy. “We have free media and democracy. It is one of the beauties of Mongolia: that we have this ability to have so much different media, from black and white to middle ground.”
Chinbat acknowledged that Mongolia’s culture of ubiquitous citizen journalists operating in a society that is not particularly media literate could be frustrating, but said: “Media should be challenging – that is what I fought for in my period in the media industry. Democracy and freedom of speech keeps our society lively and upright.”
A bigger problem Chinbat identified was keeping younger people committed to the nomadic lifestyle, when parents sometimes want to send their children to be educated in the city.
Chinbat said that at the heart of the nomad mentality was a respect for nature, a skill to survive in extreme weathers and a neighbourliness that means doors are left open in case herdsmen get lost. Mongolian politicians will require all that tact and resourcefulness in the years ahead."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/what-does-eu-partial-oil-ban-mean-for-russia-and-rest-of-europe;2022-05-31;What does EU’s partial oil ban mean for Russia and rest of Europe?;"Ban on seaborne oil aims to cut off funds for Kremlin war machine, but some warn it could help Moscow in short term
After nearly a month of wrangling, the European Union has agreed to a partial ban on Russian oil, with the aim of cutting off funding to the Kremlin’s war machine. According to the European Council president, Charles Michel, three-quarters of Russian oil imports will be immediately affected, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
The EU is banning seaborne oil immediately, which covers about two-thirds of Russian imports to the EU. Oil transported through the critical Druzhba (“friendship”) pipeline will be exempt from the ban, a key concession to Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil.
The EU is confident most Russian oil flows will cease by the end of the year, because Germany and Poland, countries on the northern branch of Druzhba, have promised to forgo its supplies. Countries on the southern branch of the Soviet-era pipeline – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – will benefit from the temporary exemption.
That is not clear. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who has been driving sanctions policy, promised the EU would discuss how to close the loophole “as soon as possible”. Hungary is seeking EU cash to retool its oil refineries that can only take Russian crude. Croatia also needs time to boost supplies to its northern neighbour through the Adria pipeline. EU leaders have avoided giving details on the end date of the exemption for central Europe.
The EU is paying Russia about €1bn (£850m) a day for oil and gas, an invaluable source of hard currency for the Kremlin in funding its war against Ukraine. A sharp cut in those financial flows deepens Russia’s economic problems in the long term. Some economists have warned, however, that it could have the perverse effect of helping Moscow in the short term, as Russia benefits from high prices. The EU’s lengthy discussions have also given Russia time to find alternative buyers.
Motorists and businesses will see higher prices at the pumps, as the embargo feeds into higher oil prices. Governments will find it even harder to manage the already soaring cost of living. After the announcement of the EU oil embargo, the price of a barrel of Brent crude hit $124.10 (£98.59), its highest level since March, although it dropped back a little in later trading. Oil prices have already risen more than 55% this year and are at their highest levels since 2008.
Before the EU had even agreed on the oil embargo, some countries were already considering further sanctions against Russia’s biggest export: gas. Before the war, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas but EU leaders have promised to gradually phase this out. However, Ukraine’s most outspoken allies in the EU, Poland and the Baltic states, think the EU should now put an end date on Russian gas. That step is far from assured and will be even harder than talks on the unfinished oil embargo."

“Ukrainians don’t have to pay!” I am trying to buy three shawarmas in a market in Tbilisi, Georgia, but the street vendor emphatically refuses to take my money. I try to explain, even though I was warned not to say this: “I am sorry, I am not Ukrainian, I am Russian.” The vendor looks at the Ukrainian flag pin on my lapel; he doesn’t believe me.
Before 24 February, I never thought about what it means to be Russian. Now it’s all I think about.
I was born in Moscow and, until recently, lived there all my life. But “I am Russian” would literally be the last thing I would answer to the question, “Who are you?” I am a father, I am a creative executive at a film company, a writer, a journalist, a podcaster, a friend … a Russian? Well, yes, but it’s just the name on a passport that I have, nothing else.
I grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, when people of my generation – or at least the people I knew – thought of themselves as citizens of the world. After my first year at university I hitchhiked across Europe. The only time I thought about my nationality was when I was had to apply for visas. I know, however, that this was ultimately down to privilege. Unlike my friends from Dagestan, Buryatia, Yakutia or North Osetia, I could afford not to think about my Russian identity. With a Slavic face and a Slavic name, I was not subject to the everyday chauvinism that saturates Russian society.
I loved my country, but I never waved a Russian flag at a demonstration or publicly expressed my patriotism – it was just not something that people like me did. We thought about patriotism in terms of politics – if you care for your country you try to make it better. So I tried. For over a decade I went to all the opposition rallies, I protested against injustice. Like-minded people and I tried our best to make our country a better place. But I never fell for the patriotic mantras about how great Russia is or how great it used to be and should be again.
Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union was the first country to launch a man into space? Yuri Gagarin or Sergei Korolev should be proud of that, it was their achievement, not mine. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union won the great patriotic war? My grandfathers fought in it. The war broke them, but they won: they should be proud of that. I know they were. These achievements were certainly never part of my identity in the same way that they are for the “Putin majority”, my compatriots who build their sense of self on past victories to which they are associated only by an accident of birth.
But now these questions do feel important to me. “I am Russian,” I repeat to the street vendor. “But you are with them?” he asks, nodding in the direction of my companions. Maria Belkina and Kirill Zhivoi are the people who run Tbilisi Volunteers – a movement that has already helped thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Georgia. Yes, I am with them. We had just finished buying a car full of supplies – food and hygiene products to be distributed among refugees in one of the Tbilisi Volunteers help centres. “I am with them – but I am Russian.”
The day of the invasion – 24 February – is a day that will be forever seared into my memory. The enormity and the irrationality of the war was like a physical blow. In my carefully constructed social bubble, there wasn’t a single person who supported the war. We felt like leaves, scattered by a hurricane. We still feel like this.
Some of us left Russia and some stayed. I left with the film director Kantemir Balagov. It was past midnight when we were sitting in the deserted food court of Istanbul airport, waiting for our flight to Yerevan, Armenia. Nursing a glass of water, Kantemir asked me: do you think we should stop speaking in Russian? Do we have to be ashamed of our language? That is probably the only question to which I have an unequivocal answer: “No!”
Let me try to explain. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy both speak Russian, but their languages could not be more different. Zelenskiy’s Russian is passionate, emotional and vibrant – alive. The language of Russian propaganda is dead: a senseless pile-up of obscure bureaucratese. The great Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev made a powerful film, Loveless, about an absence of love in everyday Russian life. The Russian that Putin and his cronies speak reflects this – it is deliberately un-alive. So no, we will never be ashamed of Russian: we speak a different language.
It’s not quite the same with our passports. In the line to the border control in Istanbul, I overheard a conversation between a Ukrainian mother and daughter. They were standing right behind me – they were trying to fly back home to Kyiv. They left for a holiday in Turkey before the war and now they were going back to a world in which their grandmother was hiding in a bomb shelter and their father and brother had joined the territorial defence forces. I listened to their conversation and felt an overpowering sense of shame. My Russian passport burned like hot coal in my pocket.
I don’t think I will be able to read any of my favourite Russian books or watch Russian films or TV shows that I loved any time soon. They all have has the same ending now: 24 February and the robotic voice of President Putin announcing his “limited military operation”. Bucha, Irpen, Hostomel, Mariupol … We will have to write new books and make new films. And, step by step, we will figure out what it means to be Russian now.
Back in Tbilisi, I finally convince the vendor to take my money. “You don’t support the war, do you?” he asks me suspiciously. No, of course I don’t. How can anyone support this bloody madness? But while I am very much against the war and against Putin, I am Russian. For some reason, it is important for me to say that. As I am about to leave, he gives me an extra kebab for free.

They left for a holiday in Turkey before the war and now they were going back to a world in which their grandmother was hiding in a bomb shelter and their father and brother had joined the territorial defence forces. I listened to their conversation and felt an overpowering sense of shame. My Russian passport burned like hot coal in my pocket.
I don’t think I will be able to read any of my favourite Russian books or watch Russian films or TV shows that I loved any time soon. They all have has the same ending now: 24 February and the robotic voice of President Putin announcing his “limited military operation”. Bucha, Irpen, Hostomel, Mariupol … We will have to write new books and make new films. And, step by step, we will figure out what it means to be Russian now.
Back in Tbilisi, I finally convince the vendor to take my money. “You don’t support the war, do you?” he asks me suspiciously. No, of course I don’t. How can anyone support this bloody madness? But while I am very much against the war and against Putin, I am Russian. For some reason, it is important for me to say that. As I am about to leave, he gives me an extra kebab for free.

Military expert Phillips O’Brien explains to Archie Bland why that matters – for this war and for future conflicts
Good morning. On Monday, Russian troops began to advance into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held in Ukrainian hands. The city is important to the control of Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas. If it falls, that success – achieved at the cost of the city’s ruination and 1,500 civilian lives – will be viewed as grim vindication for Vladimir Putin’s decision to consolidate Russian forces in the region and bombard targets with artillery fire.
There’s something else about the battle for Sievierodonetsk, though: while Russian tanks are moving into the centre of the city, they were not able to encircle it first. Cutting a city off from its supply lines to soften it up is brutally effective, as the siege of Mariupol indicated. So why hasn’t that happened here?
For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, about a compelling explanation that could have much bigger consequences: Russia may be running out of tanks. That’s after the headlines.
Energy | The European Union agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks in Brussels. The sanctions, hailed as a “remarkable achievement”, will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
Partygate | Momentum is building for a leadership challenge to Boris Johnson as soon as next week. As three more MPs called on Johnson to go, rebels expressed anger at what they said was a lurch to the right after Partygate.
Champions league final | Uefa commissioned an independent report into chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France on Saturday where some Liverpool fans were teargassed. France’s interior minister admitted access to the ground had been “disorganised” but blamed counterfeit tickets sold to English fans.
Justice | Police and prosecutors have been told to stop the mass collection of personal information from rape victims by the UK’s data watchdog. The information commissioner said police are going on unjustified “fishing expeditions” into complainants’ personal information.
Music | Glastonbury festival announced its full lineup for this summer, with acts including Sam Fender, Megan Thee Stallion and Foals among those added to the bill. Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar had already been announced.
Few assets of conventional warfare are more intimidating than the tank, and when Russia attacked Ukraine, its invasion force of around 1,500 (out of a total of about 2,800) was often judged to be among the most formidable in the world. Phillips O’Brien was never especially convinced by that analysis, and given the accuracy of his earlier assessments of Russian might – in January, he wrote that Russia “lacks the ability to mount sustained military operations and deploy a wide range of military forces at the same time” – it’s worth paying attention to his view of the current situation.
So, what should we expect next in Ukraine? O’Brien believes that Russian advances have largely stalled because the country’s forces are running very short of tanks, and other armoured vehicles. It’s a view he laid out in a Twitter thread on Sunday, and which built on a piece for the Atlantic last week, based on evidence from the eastern Donbas region. I asked him how he reached that conclusion, and what it might mean.
What are tanks supposed to do?
Tanks are powerful, well-armoured, and move fast in open country. “They’re usually used to seize the land between cities quickly and surround an enemy,” O’Brien told me. “In Russian doctrine, you have these battalion tactical groups which are supposed to have maybe 10 tanks alongside 30 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) carrying the infantry.”
The theory – dating back to the second world war – is that tanks allow you to punch a hole in the enemy lines and cut forces or a strategic target like a city off from supplies, softening them up before a final assault. All of that relies on effective air support to neuter the threat that enemy jets and drones pose to the progress of the armour on the ground.
What’s happened in reality?
Nothing which Vladimir Putin will be pleased to hear about. “When I look at Donbas, I don’t see the kind of breakthroughs which you would want to see in modern armoured warfare,” O’Brien said. “You want to get through the line and then exploit the situation by quickly encircling the enemy. What we’re seeing is that the Russians may make a hole in the line, but then they are stopped.”
He points to the failure to encircle Sieverodonetsk, and declining numbers in Ukrainian claims of Russian tanks being destroyed. That could mean a change in Russian deployment or in Ukraine’s ability to attack them. But since at the same time the Russian machine has failed to break through after its artillery has softened the Ukrainian forces up, it is more likely to indicate that there are simply fewer tanks in the fight in the first place.
While exact measures of the scale of the damage to Russian armour are hard to come by, Ukraine has claimed more than 1,300 Russian tanks have been destroyed. The lowest independent assessments are more than 700 destroyed or captured. The Pentagon, which does not appear to have made unrealistically high estimates so far, puts it at about 1,000 – a number which O’Brien thinks is “probably a safe bet”.
“Those are vast losses,” O’Brien said. In its usually reliable defence intelligence update on Friday, the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia was now moving 50-year-old T-62 tanks out of storage for deployment. “These tanks are antiquated,” O’Brien said. “The Russians don’t have nearly the frontline armoured capability that they had.”
Why has that happened?
The military doctrine that sees tanks as all-powerful is pretty out of date, as you might expect given its second world war foundations. There are many examples of videos that appear to show Russian tanks being destroyed by handheld missiles, some of which – like the British-manufactured Next-generation Light Anti-armour Weapon (NLAW) (pictured below held by a Ukrainian soldier shortly after destroying an armoured personnel carrier) – are designed to strike on top of the tank, where its armour is weakest.
Most importantly, Russia has failed to secure the air superiority which is a prerequisite of effective tank warfare – instead finding that Ukrainian planes and drones continue to be able to stop Russian tanks in their tracks. “They’re far more vulnerable than they need to be,” said O’Brien. “They’re not flying air patrols, or close air support. So they’re running into considerable defensive firepower.”
How did Russia get itself into this position?
Because it overestimated its prospects of air superiority, and underestimated the capacity of simple, cheap anti-tank systems to stop it in its tracks. If, as O’Brien has written, “we are witnessing in Ukraine the final war of 20th-century militaries”, we might be shocked that the Kremlin entered such a fight without a clear-eyed assessment of the likely risks – but “dictators on the whole have systems that tell them what they want to hear, and Putin has clearly done that”.
As for the failure of analysts worldwide to spot the same flaw: “A lot of people fell for what we could call ‘the American trap’: because the US military was able to do something, people looked at other militaries, and just view it as a scaled-down version of the US. And that is not the case here. The Russian military is an entirely more deficient beast. The US can overwhelm an enemy with complex air systems and defeat their air defences, it still has the capacity to do these ‘break out’ operations. Russia just can’t.”
What does it mean for the future of this war – and wars around the world?
It’s obviously favourable to Ukraine if the tanks are failing, but as Russia’s grim progress in Sieverodonetsk indicates, it doesn’t signal an end to the fight. “If they’re bringing out obsolete equipment they probably can’t keep going with their current approach for that much longer,” said O’Brien.
“The problem the Ukrainians then have is: can they drive the Russians back? I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a summer of ranged warfare, mostly – more attritional combat with both sides trying to destroy the other’s resources.” That’s why, as the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh wrote yesterday, Ukraine has been pleading with its western allies for longer-range rocket systems.
There is, meanwhile, a wider positive for those who fear Russia’s invasion signals a new era of military expansion around the world. “The one hopeful thing to come out of this is that this conflict demonstrates that going to war is really hard,” O’Brien said. “And it may be that militaries around the world look at it and realise that war is fraught with enormous new risks because of the power of cheaper forces. So maybe people will be less likely to take that risk in the future.”
Guessing how many Tory MPs have submitted no-confidence letters in the prime minister is essentially a game of pin the tail on the donkey, but Katy Balls’ well-informed piece helps you peek from behind the blindfold a little.

The European Union has agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, after tweeting on Monday night that sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the ban “will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year” because Germany and Poland had committed to renounce deliveries via a pipeline to their territory.
Michel added that the package also included removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”.
Von der Leyen called the agreement on a sixth sanctions package was “an important step forward” and said the bloc had agreed a “massive investment in renewable energy” in order to compensate for the diversifying away from Russian oil.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, later tweeted: “A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.”
Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. At a summit in Brussels, EU leaders had been attempting to find a way to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Putin’s war machine.
Under a compromise plan that was discussed at the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.
In a press conference on Monday night, Michel acknowledged talk of a lack of European unity, adding: “I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.”
Michel said the European Council and G7 was also ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid its post-war reconstruction and immediate liquidity needs. However, von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”.
The EU had stalled over its latest sanctions against Russia for nearly four weeks since the Von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil by the end of the year.
Arriving at the summit, Orbán said “the pipeline solution is not bad” but insisted his country needed guarantees it could get oil from other sources if there was an “accident” at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. In typically pugnacious style, Orbán attacked the commission for what he called its “irresponsible behaviour” and blamed it for creating a “difficult situation”.
The bloc has come under increasing criticism for slow progress in agreeing the latest sanctions package, the sixth, including from Zelenskiy, who addressed the gathering on Monday by video link.
Ukraine’s president called on leaders to end their disputes, which “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”, according to an extract of his speech published on Telegram.
The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said earlier he was confident there was a “good solution” on the oil embargo. Germany, along with Poland, has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Officials close to the talks say the decision of these two large economies to forgo oil from the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline means the EU oil embargo would cover 93% of Russian oil supply by the end of the year.
As yet there is no end date on the exemption for the southern leg of Druzhba, covering Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.
Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said he intended to warn his fellow leaders not to get “bogged down” in details. “The big picture is that we have to starve Russia, Moscow, of the funds to continue the war,” he said. “If each European country only thinks about itself then we will never move forward.”
Italy, the Baltic states, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries that import oil on tankers had initial reservations about an exemption for pipeline oil that would give an advantage to those countries that can continue to import cheaper Russian oil. But there was growing willingness to accept an imbalance on the EU’s internal market to secure agreement on sanctions.
Beyond sanctions, EU leaders are expected to approve €9bn in emergency support for Ukraine, although there is no decision yet on whether the funds will be low-interest loans or non-repayable grants.
Ukraine will need hundreds of billions to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals, residential buildings and infrastructure. The European Commission has proposed a jointly managed reconstruction body to be organised by Ukraine and the EU, with contributions from international institutions.
As EU talks went on, it emerged Russia would cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. The Dutch-backed trader GasTerra revealed the move after the company refused to meet the Kremlin’s demand of paying Gazprom in roubles. About 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia.
Some EU leaders are already talking about a seventh round of Russia sanctions targeting gas. But some argue the EU rushed too quickly into an oil embargo. “We talked about oil, under pressure from [the] Baltics and Poland before having done our homework,” a senior EU diplomat said. “Under the pressure of this war we have maybe taken some steps too soon and we are now facing the consequences.”

A French journalist has been killed after an armoured evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian and French authorities have said.
News channel BFMTV said in a statement it was “immensely saddened” to announce the death of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, who had worked for it for six years and was on his second tour of the conflict, adding that the journalist and cameraman was killed on the road to Lysychansk.
“Our reporter was covering the ongoing war. He was the victim of shrapnel while following a humanitarian operation in an armoured vehicle on Monday,” the 24-hour news station said.
“He was accompanied by his colleague, Maxime Brandstaetter, who was slightly injured during this strike, and their fixer, Oksana Leuta, who was unharmed.” Leclerc-Imhoff had been reporting from the easternmost Ukrainian-held city, which has come under intense attack from Russia.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the reporter “was in Ukraine to show the reality of the war. On board a humanitarian bus, alongside civilians forced to flee to escape Russian bombs, he was fatally shot. I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.”
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “A little more than a month ago I gave an interview to this very TV channel. It was my first interview to the French media during the full-fledged war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric’s colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24.”
BFMTV said the tragedy “reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been reporting this conflict at the risk of their lives for more than three months now”.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media advocacy group, said over a dozen journalists had been killed while reporting on the Ukraine conflict.
France’s new foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has called for an investigation into Leclerc-Imhoff’s death. “France demands that a probe is carried out as soon as possible and in transparency on the circumstances of this drama,” she said in a statement.
Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that the armoured evacuation vehicle came “under enemy fire” as it went to collect 10 people from the area. There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities, who have repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine.
“Shrapnel from the grenades pierced the armour of the car … a fatal wound in the neck was received by an accredited French journalist who was making a report on the evacuation. A policeman on patrol was saved by a helmet,” Haidai said.
Andrei Marotchko, a spokesperson for the self-declared People’s Republic of Luhansk, told the Russian news agency Tass that it was unlikely Leclerc-Imhoff was a journalist and claimed could have been delivering arms to Ukrainian forces.
“He is not presented just as a journalist, even the Ukrainian media say he was a volunteer,” Marotchko said. “We do not rule out him having carried arms and ammunition to the [Ukrainian] army positions. That’s why he met such a sad fate. I wouldn’t describe him as a journalist because all his activities were probably of another nature.
“He could be described as a foreign mercenary. We can say with certainty he was an accomplice of the far-right Ukrainian forces because we have observed the kind of aid these volunteers deliver. They deliver arms and munition capable of killing civilians.”
Efforts to evacuate civilians from the area were suspended after the death, which came as Russian tanks and troops began advancing into Sievierodonetsk – the largest city in the Donbas still held by Ukraine.
Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remained after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol.
“They [the Russian army] use the same tactics over and over again,” Haidai said. “They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.”
Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces tried to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were trying to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering from the relentless bombardment in basements and bunkers.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk."

A French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, was killed after an evacuation car was hit near the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.”
EU leaders failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided.
Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures.
Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles. The scheme would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt.
In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”.
The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February.
The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv.
Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.”
“Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech last night about the status of Sievierodonetsk.
The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1.
Lavrov also denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day”."

Joe Biden has said the US will not supply Ukraine with rockets that can reach into Russia, in an attempt to ease tensions with Moscow over the potential deployment of long-range missiles with a range of about 185 miles.
The White House has been weighing up pleas from Ukraine – which is losing ground in the battle for Donbas – for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) to offset Moscow’s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery, amid Russian warnings that doing so would cross a red line.
“We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden told reporters on Monday after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware.
The US-made MLRS comes in many different variants, which in turn use a variety of munitions. The longest range can fire missiles up to 185 miles away, but others use rockets with shorter ranges of 20 to 40 miles.
The precise meaning of Biden’s remark on Monday was unclear, but it was consistent with other briefings from the weekend that the White House was willing to provide MLRS as long as it withheld the longest-range missiles.
That was repeated on Monday. One senior US official said: “MLRS is under consideration, but nothing is on the table with long-range strike capabilities.”
The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev described Biden’s remarks as “reasonable” and warned that if his country’s cities had been struck, then Russian forces would “have struck at the centres of these criminal decisions”.
Ukraine appears close to losing the city of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city it had held in the Donbas region, amid a relentless Russian artillery barrage that has destroyed large parts of a city that had a prewar population of 100,000.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged late on Sunday that “the entire critical infrastructure” and “more than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock” had been “completely destroyed”, as he asked for “more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people”.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said: “The disparity in artillery capability is a major factor allowing the Russian ground forces to continue pushing forwards.”
Russian firepower was preventing Ukraine’s forces from massing for counterattacks, the analyst said, adding that MLRS could help Kyiv by “disrupting all kinds of activity in enemy rear areas”.
Last week, Ukraine’s ministry of defence released a video of what it said was the shelling of its positions by Russian TOS-1A flamethrower rockets in the Donetsk area. “Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need Nato-style MLRS. Immediately,” the ministry’s Twitter feed said.
The M270 tracked MLRS, and its wheeled equivalent, the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS), have a far greater range than anything Ukraine can deploy at the moment. Using them could allow Kyiv to hit at Russian targets from further back, although it could expose more of its hinterland to retaliation.
Ukraine began the war with artillery such as Soviet-standard howitzers with a range of about 10 miles, before the US agreed to send 90 M777 Nato-standard artillery pieces to Ukraine. Depending on the shells used, M777s can have a range of up to 25 miles.
Other Nato members may follow the US lead. Ukraine has also been pressing the UK to supply some of its own M270s, with some sources complaining that Britain has been dragging its feet. The British M270 has a range of 52 miles, although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles.
Last Friday Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said MLRS would enable the Ukrainians “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go”. His remarks, a public acknowledgment of Ukraine’s request, fuelling expectations an announcement could come within days.
Briefings from the US have suggested an announcement could come later this week, after Monday’s Memorial Day holiday."

The rumours have spanned the gamut: Vladimir Putin is suffering from cancer or Parkinson’s disease, say unconfirmed and unverifiable reports, the Russian leader has survived a coup attempt or, as some tabloids think, he is already dead and has been replaced by a body double.
Photographs of Putin meeting top aides are inspected in microscopic detail: is he gripping the table in pain during a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu in late April? Is his puffy face a sign of steroid use, as former foreign secretary Lord Owen claimed in March?
As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, reports suggest that Russia’s leader may be ill. But that may be just wishful thinking for Putin’s many critics, who appear ready to embrace conspiracy theories of divine vengeance or palace coups for his unrelenting assault on Ukraine.
In an interview on Sunday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was forced to deny speculation that Putin was ill or dying, as the diplomat continued to defend Russia’s assault on Ukraine.
“President Vladimir Putin appears in public every day,” Lavrov said in an interview with French television. “You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his performances. I don’t think that sane people can see signs of some kind of illness or poor health.”
He said he left reports of Putin’s poor health “on the conscience of those who spread such rumours”.
On Monday, Putin spoke with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and chaired a meeting of his security council. Both meetings were held remotely, as the Kremlin leader continues his coronavirus isolation. Aides and world leaders who have met Putin but have not quarantined have been forced to sit at a long table, dozens of metres away from the president.
Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said he believed that Putin was both seriously ill and that he had survived a recent coup attempt, saying only that the supposed attackers came from the Caucasus region.
“He has several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer,” Budanov told Ukrainian outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda. “But it’s not worth hoping that Putin will die tomorrow.” He also claimed that a coup “will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched.”
A former Soviet spy has claimed that Putin has Parkinson’s disease, while New Lines Magazine claimed to have obtained a recording of an oligarch saying Putin is “very ill with blood cancer”. Neither of the reports have been confirmed.
One report from the Proekt investigative website said that Putin is believed to have thyroid cancer or another disease.
The report was based on leaked travel documents that showed that Putin had received regular visits from an oncologist and from two otolaryngologists, whom the outlet said would often make a first diagnosis of a thyroid condition. The Kremlin has not confirmed any reports about Putin being sick, saying that the Russian leader is in excellent health. Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, called it a “fabrication and untruth”.
Rumours of Putin suffering from illness and injury have stretched back for more than two decades and are, to a certain degree, the fault of the Kremlin for closely guarding information about Putin’s health and whereabouts.
Since taking power, Putin has been portrayed as an active sportsman to contrast with the image of Boris Yeltsin as a heavy drinker whose poor health made him an even poorer leader.
But Putin has disappeared for weeks at a time in the past, amid reports of sporting injuries from ice hockey and judo. He recently told an interviewer that he had fallen off a horse early in his presidency as well.
The Kremlin has regularly used pre-filmed reports, often called “conserves”, to make it appear that Putin is in meetings when he is in fact unaccounted for. One extended absence took place during the coronavirus outbreak, when Putin claimed to be in Moscow while reports said he was in Sochi, occasionally appearing in an identical office as if in Moscow.
Since the beginning of the war, some reports have focused specifically on Putin’s pained body language, suggesting that he may have some back problems. A bulky frame has been explained alternatively as the president wearing a back corset or some kind of body armour when in public.
Those rumours gained steam when Putin noticeably grimaced during a meeting with Shoigu in late April. Putin will turn 70 in October and the focus on his health is likely to continue as he ages. But Budanov said he believed that Putin “still has at least a few years left. Whether we like it or not, that’s the truth.”"

We are having a similar experience to Paul Hanlon and Rebecca Shepherd regarding refugees from Ukraine (‘It doesn’t make sense’: Ukrainian teenager left in limbo by Home Office, 29 May). We’re sponsoring a 17-year-old from Kyiv whose parents are unable to travel because of the need to care for his grandmother.
He speaks good English, and his mother has supplied a letter consenting to his travelling and staying with us, yet the Home Office isn’t processing his application. Also, local children’s services won’t do any checks as he’s not eligible for a visa as an unaccompanied minor. We are getting help from a solicitor, but it shouldn’t be difficult to safeguard him and others. My partner is a magistrate and I have had a series of criminal record checks over the years for my roles working with vulnerable people. One can’t help but think it’s all part of the Tories’ hostile environment.David HoareLewes, East Sussex
Julia, 37, is a Ukrainian refugee from Odesa with a four-month-old baby daughter, both sheltering in Spain. Her husband is serving in the Ukrainian navy. Julia has been offered a warm welcome here in Wiltshire, but five weeks after applying for visas these have still not been granted. Instead, the UK government required that her baby undergo biometric testing in Madrid, an eight-hour round trip, and now she has to wait until a hard-copy visa can be shipped to her.
Even our MP does not have access to information to sustain her hopes. Julia and her daughter do not deserve to be treated in this way. The process is utterly shameful and shows the UK in a very poor light. Doric Bossom Pitton, Wiltshire

Russian tanks and troops have begun advancing into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine, bringing fighting street by street as the Kremlin’s forces continue to grind forwards in the east of the country.
Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remains after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol.
“Unfortunately we have disappointing news: the enemy is moving into the city,” the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, told Ukrainian national television on Monday.
The Russian army “use the same tactics over and over again. They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.”
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia makes slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining Ukrainian defenders.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were fighting to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering in basements and bunkers to escape relentless bombardment.
Local authorities estimated that 1,500 civilians had already died in Russian attacks on Sievierodonetsk, including from a lack of medicines. Striuk said the city had “been completely ruined” and that the number of victims was “rising every hour, but we are unable to count the dead and the wounded amid the street fighting”.
Relentless Russian artillery barrages have destroyed critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of the buildings, and power and communications have been largely cut to a city that was once home to 100,000 people.
A French journalist was killed after an armoured humanitarian evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in Sievierodonetsk. According to local authorities, shrapnel pierced the vehicle’s armour, killing Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff as he travelled alongside civilians forced to flee Russian bombs. The evacuation was called off after the attack.
Having failed to take the national capital, Kyiv, in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and airstrikes.
“They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region.
Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Gaidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child. The two cities sit on either side of the strategically important Siverskyi Donets River.
According to Ukrainian officials, Lysychansk is still under Ukrainian control, while the main road into the two cities has been shelled, but not blocked. The last remaining access and evacuation route, leading south-west towards the town of Bakhmut, remains under Ukrainian control.
The Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to prevent Russian forces from completely encircling Sievierodonetsk, which if it fell could help Moscow to consolidate its grip on the Donbas – large parts of which were controlled by Moscow-backed separatists before the 24 February invastion.
“The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the French TV channel TF1, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own.
Russian forces are also regrouping to resume their offensive further west in the direction of the Sloviansk region of eastern Ukraine, Motuzyanyk said.
“In Sloviansk, the enemy is regrouping to resume attacks in the direction of Izyum-Barvinkove and Izyum-Sloviansk,” he told a briefing.
In the south of the country, the Russian-appointed mayor of occupied Melitopol said two civilians had been wounded by an explosion that she blamed on Ukraine. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which Halyna Danylchenko denounced as a “cynical terror attack by the Kyiv regime” in remarks broadcast by Russian state television.
Meanwhile, the fate of the the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, who surrendered on 20 May, hangs by a thread.
According to Yuri Sirovatko, a pro-Moscow separatist official and justice minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian fighters may face the death penalty.
“The court will make a decision about them,” Sirovatko was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. “For such crimes we have the highest form of punishment in the DNR – the death penalty.
“All the prisoners of war are on the territory of the DNR,” he said, adding that there were about 2,300 soldiers from Azovstal among them."

The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February.
A career diplomat who served as US ambassador to Slovakia until recently, Bridget Brink was nominated by President Joe Biden in late April and confirmed unanimously by the US Senate on 18 May.
Brink confirmed her arrival in Kyiv with a tweet noting that she had visited the foreign ministry to present her credentials. “Our first priority is to help Ukraine defend itself,” she wrote.
The US embassy evacuated all family members and non-essential staff in January and moved operations to Lviv in western Ukraine in mid-February. Immediately before the Russian invasion, the diplomats moved again, to Rzeszów in Poland.
At the time, the Americans were criticised in some quarters for their departure, with widespread scepticism inside Ukraine and in other European capitals over the apocalyptic warnings coming from US and British intelligence that Russia was preparing for full-scale war.
In the end, almost all western diplomats left Kyiv, either before or immediately after Russia launched its invasion.
Since the Russian army was pushed away from the region around Kyiv at the end of March, small teams of diplomats have been slowly returning. The British ambassador arrived at the end of April. The US embassy restarted limited operations in Kyiv two weeks ago.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called the reopening a “momentous step”, in a statement after the American flag was raised at the embassy on 18 May. The skeleton US diplomatic presence that has returned to Kyiv is mainly locked down at the embassy, a large compound in the suburbs.
Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported the Pentagon was considering deploying special forces operatives to guard the embassy.
When Brink presents her credentials to Zelenskiy it will mark the first time the US has had a full-fledged ambassador to Ukraine in three years, after the departure of Marie Yovanovitch in 2019, who was recalled by Donald Trump and became embroiled in the scandal over Trump associates attempting to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate the activities of Biden’s son in Ukraine.
During the buildup to Russia’s invasion, the US embassy was headed by a chargé d’affaires, Kristina Kvien."

Six million households in Britain face the possibility of morning and evening blackouts this winter to maintain sanctions against Russia, as do consumers across Europe. This is despite Europe pouring about $1bn a day into Russia to pay for the gas and oil it continues to consume. This seems crazy. Proposals by the EU to halt the payments are understandably being opposed by countries close to Russia and heavily dependent on its fossil fuels; Germany buys 12% of its oil and 35% of its gas from Russia, figures that are much higher in Hungary.
The EU in Brussels seems not to know what to do. A diplomatic compromise has been raised – exempting sanctions on imports via pipeline, which would spare Hungary and Germany – but no practical plan has been agreed. The real reason is that arguments over the sanctions weapon have been reduced to macho rhetoric. They are supposed to induce a foreign regime to change some unacceptable policy. This rarely if ever happens, and in Russia’s case it has blatantly failed. Apologists now claim that sanctions are merely a deterrent, intended to work in the medium to long term. As war in Ukraine shifts into a different gear, that term could be long indeed.
Sanctions may have harmed Russia’s credit-worthiness, but the 70% surge in world gas prices alone has supercharged its balance of payments. Its current account trade surplus, according to its central bank, is now over three times the pre-invasion level. At the same time, sanctions are clearly hurting countries in western and central Europe who are imposing them.
It is absurd to expect Hungary to starve itself of energy and, as it says, “nuclear bomb” its economy, with no fixed objective or timetable in sight. Sanctions have an awful habit of being hard to dismantle. Worse is to come. Russia’s reaction to sanctions has been to threaten to cut off gas to Europe, further driving up prices to its advantage. It is already blockading the Black Sea ports, from which millions of tons of Ukrainian grain are normally shipped to the outside world. This blockade has seen cereal prices rise 48% on their 2019 base, devastating markets, particularly across Africa. This in turn has increased the value of Russia’s own massive grain exports. Russia has offered to lift the blockade if sanctions are lifted. Whether it means this is moot, but the west cannot be blind to the unintended consequence of its sanctions war.
Nato has been sensibly scrupulous in not escalating the war in Ukraine into a Europe-wide conflict. Sanctions know no such subtlety. Millions of innocent people across Europe and far from its shores will suffer as food and energy prices soar. Supply lines are disrupted. Trade links collapse. The victims are overwhelmingly the poor.
The objective – to compel Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine – has patently not been achieved. Military aid has been far more effective in that respect. But the harm done to the rest of Europe and the outside world is now glaring. The EU should stick to helping Ukraine’s war effort and withdraw economic sanctions against Russia. They are self-defeating and senselessly cruel.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/30/reflection-review-reflection-vidblysk-valentyn-vasyanovych-ukraine-donbas-war;2022-05-30;Reflection review – a shaken, horrifying outcry for Ukraine – and statement of hope;"Ukrainian director Valentyn Vasyanovych’s enigmatic war drama, set in Donbas, is brutal in its depiction of conflict but also elusively redemptive
Set at the start of the Donbas war in 2014, Valentyn Vasyanovych’s fifth feature, Reflection, chimes horribly with the current mood, grim and exacting as it is compared with previous, more ironic films about the conflict such as Sergei Loznitza’s Donbass and Roman Bondarchuk’s Volcano. It is composed in largely static tableau shots, many of them featuring windows, windscreens and other partitions, implying both the estranged unreality of the conflict taking place so close to civilised life, as well as an elusive redemption sought by the film’s characters.
The first window gets covered in multicoloured splatters at the paintballing birthday party of Polina (played by Nika Myslytska, Vasyanovych’s daughter), child of Serhiy (Roman Lutskyi), a Ukrainian surgeon. It’s a playful allusion to nearby warfare, which Serhiy discusses with Andriy (Andriy Rymaruk), the current partner of his ex-wife Olha (Nadia Levchenko). But when the two men head out to the frontline, they run into a Russian checkpoint and are captured. Serhiy is tortured by fists and electrodes, then forced to assist in the brutalisation of other Ukrainians – including Andriy – by checking their vital signs to see if they are still alive.
These scenes, which contain one of Reflection’s few bursts of camera movement as Serhiy is frogmarched into the bowels of the security outpost, thrust us into a harrowing abyss. Serhiy contemplates suicide in his cell, helps load corpses into an incinerator in the back of a truck marked “Russian humanitarian aid” and is finally forced into a terrible predicament regarding Andriy. Vasyanovych’s unwavering style is the cinematic equivalent of having your eyes prised open, which gives his film the kind of unrelenting horror of Come and See.
The tableau method arguably weighs Reflection down a little in its second half, as Serhiy adjusts to civilian life, but Vasyanovych lets some metaphysical light filter through. While Serhiy is reconnecting with his daughter, a pigeon is killed as it flies into his apartment window; the ghostly smear it leaves behind, like an imprint of a soul, symbolises all at once the missing Andriy, the difficulty of forgetting, and a state of grace that may still exist in the world. Hauntingly enigmatic in its storytelling, even with the highly controlled formalism, Reflection is both a shaken outcry for Ukraine and subdued declaration that hope still lies beyond.
Reflection is available on 2 June on the BFI Player."

The Eurovision song contest winners Kalush Orchestra have auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army.
The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised $900,000 (£713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone and a further $370,000 by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance.
The winning bid for the trophy was attributed to Whitebit, a cryptocurrency exchange, and came in the form of 500 ethereum.
Writing on Facebook, the band said: “You guys are amazing. We appreciate each and every one of you who donated to this auction and a special thanks to the team Whitebit who purchased the trophy for $900,000 and are now the rightful owners of our trophy.”
Sunday’s auction was hosted by Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula. The money is going to his charitable fund, which raises money for the Ukrainian army in their battle against invading Russian forces.
Bids were accepted in cryptocurrency and traditional currencies.
Prytula said there were 31,088 entries into the hat raffle and the winner was based in the Czech Republic.
Kalush Orchestra, who were fighting as part of the Ukrainian resistance only weeks before Eurovision, received support from across Europe for their performance.
They beat Britain’s Sam Ryder into second place, with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, going on to claim the country would host the contest in Mariupol next year."

The sharp polarisation between mainly western liberal democracies and the rest of the world in perceptions of Russia has been laid bare in an annual global poll of attitudes towards democracy.
Within Europe, 55% of those surveyed for the Alliance of Democracies said they were in favour of cutting economic ties with Russia due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, whereas in Asia there was a majority against, and in Latin America opinion was evenly split.
Negative views of Russia are largely confined to Europe and other liberal democracies. Positive views of Russia have been retained in China, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The annual Democracy Perception Index, carried out after the invasion of Ukraine, covers 52 highly populated countries in Asia, Latin America, the US and Europe.
Majorities in a total of 20 countries thought economic ties with Russia should not be cut due to the war in Ukraine. They included Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Colombians were evenly split.
By contrast, among the 31 countries that favoured cutting ties, 20 were in Europe.
Although Russian diplomats will point to the findings as evidence that global public opinion does not share western interpretations of events in Ukraine, the level of distrust of Russia in some countries was high.
The countries with a widely held most negative view of Russia included Poland (net negative 87%), Ukraine (80%), Portugal (79%), Italy (65%), UK (65%), Sweden (77%), US (62%) and Germany (62%). Even in Hungary – whose leader Viktor Orbán is an ally of Putin – a net 32% have a negative view of Russia. In Venezuela, often seen as propped up by Russia, the local population has a net negative view of Russia of 36%.
Countries with a net positive view of Russia included India (36%) Indonesia (14%), Saudi Arabia (11 %), Algeria (29%), Morocco (4%), and Egypt (7%).
Despite the mixed views about Russia, strong sympathy was shown for Ukraine. Most people surveyed in Asia, Latin America and Europe thought Nato, the US and the EU could do more to help Ukraine. In Latin America, 62% of respondents thought Nato has done too little and only 6% too much. In Europe 43% said Europe has done too little and 11% too much. In China, 34% said the US has done too much to help. Nearly half (46%) globally said that the European Union, United States and Nato were doing too little to assist Ukraine, while 11% said they are doing too much.
Negative perceptions of China are not as widespread as for Russia. British respondents were the most likely to want to cut economic ties with China if it invaded Taiwan."

A Ukrainian MP visiting Britain has urged the west to supply long-range rockets to her country – and warned without further military help her country risked deadlock or defeat in its war against Russia.
Kira Rudik, the leader of the opposition liberal Golos party, said she was afraid of the three-month long war “becoming the new normal” and that the west would not supply the Nato-standard weapons Ukraine needed to push back the invaders.
“One bad outcome is that this war becomes a stalemate, like a long-term frozen conflict,” Rudik said in an interview with the Guardian. “One of our goals is to make sure that the world does not get used to a war being in Ukraine.”
The MP argued that Ukraine’s “first and foremost need is weapons” because without battlefield success Kyiv would come under pressure to give up territory to Russia, as suggested by the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger – a suggestion Rudik said was “borderline … how do I not say the word stupid?”.
The 36-year-old said she was in daily contact with frontline troops and conceded Ukraine’s military was “not fine; they are under a lot of pressure” as Russian forces advance under heavy shelling in the eastern Donbas region.
“We should not repeat Russia’s mistake of underestimating us. We should not underestimate Russia right now,” Rudik said. It remained possible that as well a deadlock, Ukraine could yet be more seriously defeated, she added.
Ukraine’s army needed multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of hundreds of kilometres, Rudik argued, which are already the subject of intense lobbying by Kyiv – and which could be supplied by the US and others within days.
“We need to let our soldiers on the front fight better and for that we need MLRS systems, longer-range systems,” Rudik said. “We know that there is like no peaceful agreement on this conflict. We will need to win it militarily.”
Capable of firing 12 rockets in a minute, Ukraine believes the US-made M270 MLRS could turn around Kyiv’s fortunes, with Russia currently outshelling it and, under the heavy bombardment, closing in on Sievierodonetsk.
But the rocket artillery is controversial not least because it would give Ukraine the capacity to reach inside Russia. That has prompted warnings from Moscow that a US decision to supply the systems would “cross a red line”.
Rudik is in the UK for a few days where she is meeting MPs in London and Scotland, including Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, part of her first trip abroad since the war began on 24 February.
On the second day of the war Rudik was pictured holding a Kalashnikov rifle, saying she was prepared to use it to defend Kyiv. “Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men,” she wrote in a tweet that was picked up around the world.
I learn to use #Kalashnikov and prepare to bear arms. It sounds surreal as just a few days ago it would never come to my mind. Our #women will protect our soil the same way as our #men. Go #Ukraine! 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/UbF4JRGlcy
The MP said she did not have to use the weapon as Russian forces bore down on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war, but insisted she remained willing to do so if necessary, not least because of the sexual violence the invaders had inflicted on Ukrainian women and girls in occupied suburbs north-east of the capital.
“I have been to Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka since the days of the occupation and I have talked to women who suffered from sexual crimes,” she said. “Honestly, this is probably one of the parts [reasons] why I have the rifle.”"

In a field near Odesa, Igor Shumeyko pointed to where a Russian rocket landed near his farmhouse. It blew out the glass from his windows. Three more missiles fell on a neighbouring plot but didn’t explode. “I was on my land when the invasion started. The Russians think we are slaves. But our guys are going to kick them out,” Shumeyko predicted.
In the meantime, the 42-year-old farmer acknowledged his industry is facing a heap of war-related problems. The biggest is what to do with this season’s crop, currently growing on his 1,000-hectare estate. The wheat is due to be harvested in late June and July. Next come sunflowers in August and September.
Before Russia’s offensive, Shumeyko would load the grain on to a truck. It would be transported 15 miles from his village of Velykyi Dalnyk to Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest commercial port. From there, food products continued their journey by ship across the Black Sea. Ukraine’s grain helped feed an estimated 400 million people. It went to Egypt, Tunisia and beyond.
Since 24 February, however, this maritime traffic has entirely ceased. Russia has blockaded and occupied all of Ukraine’s seaports. It has seized Mariupol and Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov, which is now a de facto Russian lake, and overrun Snake Island, a strategic base, allowing it to control shipping to and from the Dardanelles strait.
Ukraine can no longer export its agricultural produce. About 22m tonnes of food is stuck. Many farmers say they have no space to store this summer’s harvest. Others are building makeshift shelters. Shumeyko says he is running low on fertiliser, which used to arrive through Odesa. His last sacks of ammonium nitrate are stored next to his red tractor.
The UN World Food Programme has warned that millions of people will die if Ukraine’s ports remain blocked. Vladimir Putin has offered to open up a sea corridor but only if the west lifts what he calls “politically motivated” sanctions. He accuses Ukraine of mining its ports. Kyiv says Moscow is guilty of blackmail, with the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, calling on the world to act.
Sanctions on Russia have no connection to the unfolding global food crisis. The sole reason for shortages, rising prices, and threat of hunger is the Russian military physically blocking 22 million tons of Ukrainian food exports in our seaports. Demand Moscow to end its blockade.
The topic is now at the top of the international agenda. In a phone call on Saturday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to persuade Putin to lift the blockade, without success. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he discussed the crisis with Boris Johnson, as well as the related issue of military aid.
The Ministry of Defence points out that Ukraine has deployed maritime mines “because of the continued credible threat of amphibious Russian assaults from the Black Sea”. It says Moscow is falsely trying to present itself as a “reasonable actor”. In reality, it is leveraging global food security in order to advance its “political aims” and “to blame the west for any failure”.

Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said Russia would break any maritime deal to which it agreed, and “sink one or two Ukrainian ships”. He has suggested Turkey and the UK send vessels to enforce a waterways equivalent of a “no-fly zone” in the north-west Black Sea. “We need to unblock it militarily,” he said.
“Ukraine is an agricultural superpower,” he added. “This is our number one problem. It’s a question of the country’s survival. Without the grain, the economy will stop and die out. This isn’t just about us. It’s about the global situation. We are talking about hunger of huge proportions here.”
On Saturday, the head of Velykyi Dalnyk, Denis Tkachenko, met with other Odesa region mayors to discuss the blockade. There were no simple answers. Belarus, the Kremlin’s ally, is unlikely to facilitate road shipments without the lifting of western sanctions. Poland uses a different track gauge to Ukraine, making railway transport expensive.
The Russians, meanwhile, have twice fired cruise missiles at the bridge over the Dniester estuary in Zatoka, in the Odesa region, closing off a vital land route to the south-west and Romania. One small-scale solution is to take the grain to the Ukrainian port of Izmail on the Danube river. But this is costly for farmers at a time when diesel prices are going up.
“It used to be easy. Odesa had big traffic. It was Ukraine’s main port,” Tkachenko said. He described a tentative UK-Turkish plan to create a humanitarian sea corridor as “realistic”, adding: “Putin won’t attack English ships.” His 100-hectare farm grows wheat, sunflowers and strawberries, he said, irrigated by water taken from the Dniester through a network of Soviet-era canals.
In Odesa, the harbour is eerily quiet. The Ukrainian army has sealed off the port area. There are sandbags and checkpoints in the city’s historic centre, with its statue of Catherine the Great, Odesa’s imperial founder. The Potemkin steps – made famous by the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 film Battleship Potemkin – are no longer accessible to the public.
Russia’s apparent plan to storm Odesa from the sea has not yet happened. In the meantime, life continues. Couples, dog-walkers and kids on scooters go up and down Primorsky Boulevard, which overlooks the port. Swifts screech in the sky; the air is heady with the scent of elderflower blossom; a Pushkin statue has the inscription “Odesa resident”.
Taking in the harbour view, the Odesa city council deputy, Peter Obukhov, pointed to a row of giant steel cylinders. These, he explained, were grain silos, filled to capacity. The cranes next to them were idle. Nearby was a rusting three-masted sailing ship, Druzhba, and an ancient ferry. The Black Sea sparkled in the sunshine. It was tranquil and boatless.
The state-owned port and private tug company are the biggest employer in Odesa, with a workforce of 5,000 people. Their salaries contribute to the city’s budget. “It’s very difficult to transfer last year’s harvest by road. We need to lift the blockade,” Obukhov said. He added: “Even if Putin died and the war stopped, it would take half a year to ship the grain we already have.”
The Russians have fired long range missiles at Odesa on several occasions. But it has been spared the destruction meted out to other Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv. One explanation is the Kremlin thinks it enjoys some local support – a view not borne out by polling data and by non-scientific conversations conducted by the Guardian.
Odesa’s mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov, has dumped his previous Russian-friendly position and is now a Ukrainian patriot. According to Obukhov, who ran against Trukhanov, Moscow still plans to capture Odesa and to create a land corridor stretching to Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Russian republic of Moldova. “Putin wants everything. The whole of Ukraine and Moldova as well,” Obukhov said.
In the first days of the invasion, Russian troops advancing from Crimea captured large chunks of southern Ukraine. They include the agricultural heartlands in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Kyiv says Moscow has stolen grain from local producers as well as farming equipment and agri-drones. Satellite photos suggest thousand of tonnes have been loaded on to ships in Crimea and sold abroad, including to Syria.
Hennadiy Lahuta, the head of Kherson’s Ukrainian military administration, said some farmers were cooperating with Russia. Others are not planting or are unable to plant because of fighting. “What can be said for sure is that the Russians are transporting food and grain from the Kherson region. Traffic jams on the road to Crimea are already several kilometres long,” he said last week.
This theft has painful historical echoes. In 1932-33, about 4 million people died as a result of Stalin’s state-engineered famine in Ukraine. Teams of Communist party enforcers went to villages and individual houses, confiscating grain, seeds, cows and vegetables. Peasants starved to death. The famine – known as the Holodomor – had a political aspect. It was designed to wipe out support for Ukrainian independence.
Back in Velykyi Dalnyk, Shumeyko said he would sell his wheat and vegetables on the domestic market. It was a contribution to the war effort. He said he enjoyed his job, which involved spending time outdoors amid a blooming landscape of fields, swallows and wild roses. “A good harvest requires professionalism and protecting crops. When you bring it in, you get a great feeling in your soul.”"

Over weeks of conflict, Yurii Fenenko, a coroner in the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, had become familiar with the way war mangles bodies, charting the damage caused by shrapnel, cluster bombs and bullets.
The 44-year-old dreaded the day he knew would surely come, when the body of someone he was close to was brought in. But he was not prepared for it to be someone he knew so well.
“It was the body of a dear friend and wife of one of my best mates,” Fenenko said in an interview at the weekend, bursting into tears at the memory. “The car she was driving hit a landmine as she was trying to flee a village where she lived near Chernihiv, which had been occupied by the Russians.”
Before the war, Fenenko examined an average of four bodies a day – mostly people who had died from disease, or occasionally in a car accident or gun violence.
Everything changed when Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and Russian forces advancing from Belarus began bombarding the city. By 10 March Chernihiv was encircled by Russian forces, trapping its 150,000 inhabitants. Now Fenenko was examining up to 15 bodies a day.
“At first no one understood what was going on”, he said. “It was scary, you didn’t know what to expect. Then after a few days the first bodies started to turn up in our lab. And the numbers grew day by day.”
Space ran out in Chernihiv’s morgues, which are designed to hold 30 bodies, and corpses piled up in refrigerated trucks. Fenenko carried out his work in a room without electricity because of the bombing. A diesel generator provided dim light.
“Before the war, I had seen bodies completely torn apart by accidental explosions,” he said. “But never in such numbers.”
Fenenko’s postmortem reports are being forwarded to prosecutors investigating alleged war crimes perpetrated by Russian forces in Ukraine.
“Among the signs of torture, we found hands tied behind the back from bodies of people living in the Russian occupied villages, blindfolded, the limbs shot through,” he said. “Another time a missile hit a queue of people standing outside a grocery store. Thirty people were killed that day and they were all brought to my lab.”
Fenenko has extracted hundreds of projectiles and shrapnel from bodies, but also cluster bomb fragments, explosives which are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area. Cluster bombs are banned under international law by a 2008 treaty signed by more than 100 countries.
“You see these little cylinders? They come from a cluster bomb,” he said. “I found them in civilians’ bodies. Some of them explode when they hit the ground and some of them in the air. That’s why they hit lots of people.”
Fenenko said the most unusual thing he had found in bodies was probably fléchettes – small metal darts contained in tank or field gun shells. Each shell can contain up to 8,000 fléchettes. Once fired, shells burst when a timed fuse detonates and explodes above the ground. Once released from the shell, they disperse in a conical arch about 300m wide and 100m long. On impact with a victim’s body, the dart can lose rigidity, bending into a hook, while the arrow’s rear, made of four fins, often breaks away causing a second wound.
Early in April, Ukrainian forces liberated dozens of villages occupied by the Russians. At the end of the siege, more than 700 bodies were recovered from the Chernihiv region. Before abandoning the villages, the Russians placed thousands of mines that continue to cause injuries and deaths, while every day Ukrainian authorities find more bodies buried in the rubble.
As a coroner with over twenty years of experience, Fenenko said he had learned to put his emotions aside before starting an autopsy, but on the day police delivered the body of his old friend to his lab, it wasn’t possible.
“Fortunately, that day, there were two other experts working with me. So I let them perform the autopsy,” he said. “I just couldn’t do it.”

The EU is debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine.
Senior EU diplomats holding a special meeting on Sunday were deadlocked over a compromise plan that would see the bloc ban Russian oil arriving in tankers but allow pipeline imports, a proposal that would allow Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine.
More than three weeks after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of the year, the EU is stalled on the plans. Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil, has said it needs five years and billions of euros to upgrade its refineries.
The row threatens to overshadow a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, formally dedicated to discussing economic, political and humanitarian support for Ukraine and the crisis in global food supplies.
EU ambassadors will meet on Monday morning in a fresh attempt to find a compromise on the oil embargo. “It might not work, it might work, but I think we have a duty to try it,” a senior EU official said. Excluding pipelines from EU sanctions would protect one-third of Russian oil that comes to the bloc, preserving a valuable source of revenue for Moscow.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is due to address EU leaders via video link on Monday, criticised the bloc last week for its failure to come to an agreement on the oil embargo. “Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia,” he said on Thursday, noting that the EU was paying Russia nearly €1bn (£850m) a day for energy. “Where did those who block the sixth package get so much power?”
When the idea of excluding pipeline oil was floated weeks ago, several member states shot it down on the grounds that it gave an unfair advantage to countries that can continue getting cheap Russian crude. Internal estimates suggest Hungary could benefit from oil 35% cheaper than neighbouring countries. After weeks of stalemate, however, a growing number of countries are looking for ways to break the deadlock.
“To have no agreement or drag things further would be the worst, but to see blackmailing consequences is also disappointing,” a senior EU diplomat said.
The issue has deepened the wedge between Hungary and its traditional central European allies. A senior Polish diplomat said they could not understand the logic of Budapest’s policy on Ukraine and described opposition to the oil embargo as political rather than technical. “They have received everything that is technically reasonable,” they said.
Hungary has been offered a two-year delay in introducing the oil embargo to allow time to retool refineries and establish new oil routes from its southern neighbour Croatia.
Some advise against rushing into a hasty deal as the proposed oil embargo was not envisaged to come completely into force until the end of the year. Others feel the delay sends a terrible political signal as Russian forces appear to be gaining the upper hand in Donbas through relentless artillery fire and airstrikes.
Hungary further angered some EU states when it said the question should not even be discussed at the summit on Monday. “It would only highlight our internal divisions without offering a realistic chance to resolve differences,” Orbán wrote last week to the European Council president, Charles Michel, who is organising the meeting.
Budapest is angling for EU funds to upgrade its refineries, which can currently only take Russian oil. Orbán complained that there were not enough specifics on EU funds for landlocked central European states in a recent European Commission plan outlining how the EU can move away from Russian fossil fuels.
In that plan, known as RePowerEU, the commission made a controversial proposal to allow member states to sell surplus carbon credits that could make it cheaper to burn fossil fuels. It also suggested a voluntary transfer of funds from other parts of the EU budget.
But some of the decarbonisation funds would be placed in a recovery plan, which is unavailable to Hungary because of longstanding concerns about the rule of law in the country. The country has been denied €7.2bn in funds from the EU’s Covid recovery fund because it has failed to satisfy EU officials that it can ensure the money is spent properly.
Hungary is seen as being in a vulnerable position as the Druzhba – which translates as “friendship” – pipeline runs through Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official described the part of the pipeline running to Hungary as “great leverage” last week. Olena Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said it would be “very appropriate if something happened to this pipeline”, according to comments reported by the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.
Hungary’s opposition means other measures in the EU sanctions package have not come into force, including tightening restrictions on Russian banks and imposing asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of high-ranking Russians, including a former gymnast rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/sievierodonetsk-bombing-so-intense-casualties-cant-be-assessed-officials-say;2022-05-29;Sievierodonetsk bombing so intense, casualties cannot be assessed, officials say;"Russian forces are hitting largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine ‘200 times an hour’, causing huge damage
Officials in eastern Ukraine say Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has been so intense that it has not been possible to assess casualties and damage, as Moscow closes in on the largest city still held by Ukraine in the Donbas.
“The situation has extremely escalated,” Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders.
Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol, the southern port city that fell on 20 May after almost three months of relentless assault.
The intensified fighting came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, in his first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war.
“You risk your lives for us all and for our country,” Zelenskiy told soldiers there.
He added that Russian shelling has destroyed “the entire critical infrastructure of the city” and more than two-thirds of its housing stock. Taking Sievierodonetsk was Russia’s “principal aim” right now, the president said.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 145km (90 miles) south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
“They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region.
Having failed to take the capital Kyiv in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on the Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and air strikes.
Regional officials reported that Russian forces were “storming” Sievierodonetsk and that fighting was taking place street by street, knocking out power and mobile phone services.
Sievierodonetsk’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said those residents remaining in the city, which had a prewar population of about 100,000, risked exposure to shelling when they left their homes to access water. Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians have already died either from Russian attacks or from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn’t be treated.
Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Haidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child.
The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own.
“The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1 in an interview on Sunday.
Zelenskiy’s office posted a video on Telegram of him wearing a bulletproof vest and being shown destroyed buildings in Kharkiv and its surroundings, from where Russian forces have retreated in recent weeks.
It was the Ukrainian president’s first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers … One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation,” he said.
Last Thursday, Russian artillery pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Moscow’s troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. At least nine people have been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city.
Zelenskiy voiced hopes that his allies would provide much needed weapons and said he expected “good news” in the coming days.
A few days ago, the US and its allies indicated that they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing. Ukraine said it has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and US self-propelled howitzers.
Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak repeated a call for US-made long-range multiple-rocket launchers. US officials said such systems are actively being considered, with a decision possible in the coming days.
“It is hard to fight when you are attacked from 70km away and have nothing to fight back with,” Podolyak posted on Twitter. ”We need effective weapons.”
In the meantime, Zelenskiy said in a television interview that he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it has lost since the invasion.
Zelenskiy ruled out the idea of using force to win back all the land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014, which includes the southern peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow that year.
“I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/putin-vladimir-kara-murza-wife-russian-politician;2022-05-29;Ukraine war is Putin’s death warrant, says wife of jailed politician;"Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia says Russian president will fall over war in Ukraine
Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia thinks he will have been like a “hurricane contained inside a bottle” since he was arrested on 11 April in Moscow and held in pre-trial detention over a speech he had made in Arizona criticising the war in Ukraine.
“He has so much energy, so many ideas, and initiatives, that being contained within the four walls of a prison will be the hardest part for him,” said Evgenia, who has not been allowed to speak to him.
As a Russian politician, campaigner and regime critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza worked for 15 years alongside Boris Nemtsov, another opposition leader, who was killed in 2015.
Sitting in a hotel near Westminster on the same day she met the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, Evgenia Kara-Murza warned the UK government that her husband, a British citizen who has twice been allegedly poisoned by the Russian spy agency the FSB, may have reason to fear for his own life.
She had no criticism of her husband’s decision to repeatedly return to Russia, even after the invasion of Ukraine, saying: “He believed that as a Russian politician, he cannot call on people to continue fighting if he himself is somewhere safe, and he believes that he has to share the same risks, the same challenges as the Russians who continue to oppose this war.
“Basically, by calling this war a war, instead of the ‘special operation’ as the government wants it to be called, by saying that, a person can end up in prison for up to 15 years. On the basis of the charges laid so far Vladimir is now facing up to 10 years.”
No court date has been yet set, possibly because officials will press additional charges such as advocating personal sanctions against the regime, she said.
“Our family has been living like this for a long time,” said Kara-Murza, who has three teenage children. “He was targeted by an FSB team that tried to kill him twice in 2015 and 2017.
“Thanks to an amazing independent investigation by Bellingcat and Insider, we now know the names and the faces of those people from the FSB, who had followed him before the poisoning. Both times Vladimir was left in a coma with multiple organ failure. And I brought him back to the US. He recovered and then he went back to Russia.
“The Russian authorities have chosen this new tactic of dealing with opposition figures, especially well-known opposition figures like [Alexei] Navalny, or my husband – they try to lock them away and hide them from the public eye and prevent them from continuing to work. It is because they’re so effective when they’re outside.”
Kara-Murza said that since the war started Russia had switched from being an authoritarian regime to a totalitarian one. “There is not one independent media outlet left, there is massive repression and propaganda pumped out on national TV … There is a new iron curtain around this country.”
But she insisted dissent exists below the surface as people access news via virtual private networks or the Telegram messaging service. “I believe that Putin has not yet declared mobilisation because he knows how people will react to it. But a week or two ago, they said that there have already been 11 conscription centres burned down across Russia.
“So that’s how people protest – by saying: ‘We’re not going to go to your war.’ People get arrested for going out on the street with a copy of War and Peace. Others have been arrested for carrying ‘invisible anti-government slogans’. The police said they could see invisible things. It is that crazy.”
She pleaded for the west not to give up on the dissidents in Russia.
“I believe Putin has signed his own death warrant with this war,” she said, “but he will fall the sooner we end these double standards: at the same time as countries support the Ukrainian people by sending weapons and providing humanitarian aid and imposing sanctions on the Russian economy, they also give Putin billions for oil and gas, which allows him to continue his aggression … this has to stop because honestly, it is inexplicable.”
Her husband’s arrest and her campaign to secure his release have required her to change her role. “The fact is, I’ve never been a public figure. I’ve never been a public speaker, so everything I’m doing today, I’m learning it day by day.
“All the people I’m meeting, I heard of them, of course, from my husband’s work, but I’ve met very few of them before. So everything is novel. Everything – speaking and being on stage, speaking to journalists – is very new to me. It’s a rather glum joke, but we do have this joke in the family, that I only emerge when my husband gets poisoned or thrown in jail.”"

It was the photo of a young girl, dying in a Mariupol hospital after Russian shelling, that made up Martin Wyness’ mind. He had to go and help in Ukraine.
Less than three months later, he was in an ambulance racing to save the life of another little girl gravely injured by a Russian attack, as more shells crashed down around them. They turned around and raced back the way they had came, looking for another route to safety and medical care for the eight-year-old, whose body was peppered with shrapnel.
“They didn’t get her the first time so they had another go,” he said, in his hospital base in Donbas region. “As if that little girl wasn’t vulnerable enough.”
Wyness is part of a volunteer medical unit bridging the gap between Ukraine’s eastern frontline – which is experiencing the most intense fighting of the war – and major hospitals where war-injured soldiers and civilians can get long-term treatment for their wounds.
Medbat Pirogov volunteer hospital brings together dozens of Ukrainians, including some who returned from abroad to serve, and a handful of internationals who felt compelled to try to help out in a conflict thousands of miles from home.
“I felt this wasn’t Ukraine’s war, it was Europe’s war, my war,” said Wyness. He has twice made the journey to Ukraine from his Southampton home. The first month of the war he spent in the basement of a Kyiv hospital, patching up those injured in the battle for the city.
After the Russians were defeated he returned home for a break, but in early May returned to the new frontline near the almost-besieged town of Sievierodonetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the battle in Donbas was so intense that up to 100 of the country’s soldiers were dying in combat each day.
It is a gruelling artillery duel in which the enemy is often faceless and unseen, appearing only in the form of shells, rockets and missiles, and visible through the terrible injuries they inflict on the bodies of civilians and soldiers alike.
“Some days I think I’ve got to go, it’s just too much,” Wyness said, in an interview interrupted when shells started landing close to the base and the team had to race down to a basement bunker.
Both the injuries and the constant threat of death are exhausting; the medics are targets for a military that has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Ukraine and in Syria, killing doctors, nurses and patients in defiance of international law.
The medics are fundraising for armoured ambulances that would at least protect medics and patients from the worst of the shrapnel, but the war has sent prices even for secondhand vehicles soaring. So for now the group race towards the frontline in ordinary vehicles that would be ripped to shreds if an artillery round landed too close.
Jennifer spent $4,500 (£3,560) of her own money to travel from California and risk death daily to help out. She does not want her last name published because she told her mum she was only going to Poland to help refugees, although she told her daughters – who are 17 and 23 – the truth.
“The way I’ve raised them, they understand that this is an important thing to do,” she said. “If you know something is wrong and you don’t say or do anything, it’s doubly wrong.”
Jennifer worked as a medic in Afghanistan, on contract with the international mission, so is used to conflict injuries and dangerous environments but the intensity and proximity of the fighting in Ukraine has still shocked her.
“It’s more than I expected. Yesterday morning I was upstairs getting changed, a rocket flew by and landed just close by. The first night we got here we were in the basement, told to get ready to evacuate, because they thought the Russians had breached [Ukrainian lines] and were coming.”
She made up her mind to volunteer when she saw Zelenskiy appealing to the world for assistance in Ukraine’s struggle, and began researching her options before contacting Gennadiy Druzenko, the founder of Medbat. “It’s a struggle for freedom and they need help,” Jennifer said.
Ukrainians have tried to deter foreigners who do not have military experience from trying to go to the frontlines but Martin and Jennifer have practical skills that are needed as the deaths and injuries mount among civilians and soldiers.
There are also Ukrainian medics in the team, some returned from abroad, others unable to get commissions in the oversubscribed military medical corps but determined to serve. Dmytro Rusnak drove back from Germany with a car full of medical aid.
He had been getting ready for this moment for the best part of a decade. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea and Russian-backed proxy forces took control of parts of Donbas, Rusnak changed his speciality from radiology to acute care.
“I saw I had to prepare myself, because at any moment it was possible that Russia could start a full war,” he said. When they did, he paused only to put his contract on hold – his bosses were very understanding – and gather as much medical supplies as he could from friends and colleagues.
His main worry when the shells start falling is not his own safety but the worry he is bringing his elderly parents. “Although they are proud, it is very traumatic for them, there are no parents who want to see their children’s funeral.”
He is waiting to get his German medical qualifications certified so he can practise as a doctor in Ukraine, so for now works with Wyness as an ambulance paramedic.
“These years of education and preparation, all these skills, should be used,” he said. “I wanted to be an example, you can say thousands of words, make thousands of posts on social media, but this means nothing … you have to act, to do something.”"
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/29/homes-for-ukraine-teenager-left-limbo-home-office;2022-05-29;‘It doesn’t make sense’: Ukrainian teenager left in limbo by Home Office;"Vlad Ksheminskyi, 16, is one of hundreds of teenagers still waiting for a Homes for Ukraine decision
It has been two months since 16-year-old Vlad Ksheminskyi sent off the forms he hoped would trigger the start of a new life in Britain.
Vlad is one of hundreds of teenagers who applied to the Homes for Ukraine scheme having fled war without his parents. While the Home Office struggles to decide how to deal with cases like his, they have been left in limbo for weeks – and even months – with no decision.
“It is very difficult to be waiting, knowing that my parents are one and a half thousand miles away and our destiny is still unknown,” Vlad said. “It’s very hard.”
A keen student, Vlad was preparing for school exams when areas around his home town of Krasyliv in western Ukraine came under intense bombing. His mum, Marina, was scared for his life but, being unable to leave, she rang her best friend, Olesia Reviuk, to ask if she could help her son escape.
Reviuk, 43, recalled: “She was telling me that every day they could hear sirens and three or four times a day they would go down to the bomb shelter which was very cold, with no water. It was impossible to sleep there at night with the sirens going off.”
Reviuk did not hesitate. “I promised that I would take good care of Vlad,” she said. She arranged for him to join her and her two sons in Italy, to where she had fled in February. Then, with his parents’ blessing, she became his legal guardian.
The children spoke English and no Italian, so Reviuk applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme at the earliest opportunity.
They were matched with Paul Hanlon, a GP from Lancaster, his wife, Rebecca Shepherd, an anatomy lecturer, and their two young children. The British family quickly made ready two large spare bedrooms and a separate living room, assuming the group would soon be arriving.
Instead, two months have gone by while Reviuk and the children wait in a cramped rented room in a flat in Modena, Italy.
Reviuk said: “Living in one bedroom with two teenage boys and one small child who wakes up at night and is also sometimes sick is very difficult for us.”
Hanlon, 42, said: “It’s so frustrating to think that they could have been enjoying the space and support on offer here, but instead we’ve all been spending hundreds of hours battling with bureaucracy that seems to have been set up to deflect rather than to protect those fleeing this brutal conflict.”
Hanlon is in touch with about 40 other sponsors in similar situations, all despairing at the same impasse. “The government’s broad answer to most questions on the subject, ‘because of safeguarding’, is a cynical use of this term to avoid having to deal with the most vulnerable group affected by this war.”
Given that Vlad is travelling with a legal guardian, his case should be one of the straightforward ones. But it appears to have made no difference.
“I do not understand the logic of safeguarding me because in my country there is a war and there is no worse security situation for me than staying there,” Vlad said. “It just doesn’t make sense to me what safeguarding issues the government could have, when we have all the documents in place and Olesia is a family friend who has legal guardianship?”
The Home Office has been sent a “letter before claim” over the families’ case, threatening judicial review. Vlad’s lawyer, Simon Robinson, said: “The delay in even providing a decision while keeping the family in the dark demonstrates that the secretary of state has failed to make an adequate policy to meet the promises she has made. She is turning her back on some of the most vulnerable people fleeing the conflict, children.”
For Vlad, the waiting means uncertainty over his education. He has only a week left to tell the Ukrainian authorities which country he will be in to take his exams remotely and is unsure what to put. He also wants to apply to university.
Reviuk said: “The UK government is taking the future away from Vlad. He’s a very talented boy. He reads a lot, he wants to study. And right now we just do not see the future.”"

More than 500 Ukrainian children who fled the war without their parents are stuck waiting in limbo across Europe after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, sources working closely with the Home Office say.
Most are teenagers who thought they would be eligible and have British families waiting to host them, but have heard nothing from the Home Office.
Many have been waiting for two months or more without an answer due to indecision about how to handle their cases.
Some are alone in Europe having left home thinking they would soon be joining a British family that is ready to welcome them. Others are with adult siblings or family friends who have been made legal guardians but still have no permission to come.
About 25 unaccompanied children were allowed into Britain during the first two weeks of the Homes For Ukraine scheme and ended up in care as a result, sources say.
Though the policy now says children cannot travel without their parents unless they are with a legal guardian, the Home Office has not been offering a decision or solution to all those who applied before this was set out.
Even teenagers travelling with adults who have been made legal guardians by their parents are among those caught up in the deadlock.
Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said: “I have only this week raised concerns in a letter to the immigration minister regarding the government’s policy on unaccompanied minors, but this latest information reflects the potential scale of the problem.
“We understand that the government needs to undertake comprehensive safeguarding checks but there is a particular question about why long delays are still happening in instances where a parent has already completed the relevant paperwork which grants permission for their child to be placed in the care of a relative.”
Earlier this month, the Guardian told the story of Nazarii, 17, who was listening to war planes flying overhead in his village in western Ukraine while he waited for a decision from the Home Office. A teaching assistant and her family in Hampshire were ready to host him but he had heard nothing since submitting an application on 11 April.
More than three weeks later, he is still in Ukraine with no refusal or update. “The Home Office hasn’t given me any information. I don’t know what to do,” he said. “If it’s a refusal, OK, but without any information it’s impossible.”
Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the child refugee charity Safe Passage, said: “We know of far too many children who are currently stuck in limbo, alone in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, who are desperate to join their sponsors here in the UK. Unacceptably, this is leaving lone children in dangerous and vulnerable positions, at risk of exploitation.”
Gardiner-Smith said the government should expand the Homes for Ukraine scheme to include unaccompanied children by working with local authorities and charities to ensure safeguarding.
Even those with British hosts ready to foster children have had no decision. Among these is severely autistic 16-year-old Timothy Tymoshenko, who the Guardian reported is still waiting in Poland to be allowed to join a British foster carer.
The situation is so critical that sources said it was the biggest point of concern at the latest weekly meeting of MPs’ offices with the Home Office.
Krish Kandiah, the founder of the Sanctuary Foundation, which is supporting British hosts in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, said: “It is disturbing to hear that unaccompanied minors seeking to leave Ukraine for their own safety are waiting so long for visas when I know that there are foster carers like my own family and other appropriate hosts in the UK that are willing to care for them.”
A government spokesperson said: “Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK.
“The Ukrainian government has been clear that their preference is children should not be taken from Ukraine without their parents and that moving a child from their home region must be in their best interest.”"
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/ukraine-donbas-donetsk-luhansk-fighting-putin-kharkiv-kyiv;2022-05-29;Fighting focuses on Donbas, but Putin has not given up on Kharkiv – or Kyiv;"The outcome of Russia’s attacks on the Donetsk and Luhansk areas will determine the fate of the rest of Ukraine
After three months of full-scale war against Ukraine, in which ground troops invaded from several directions and missiles hit targets across the country, right up to the western border with Poland, the focus of the current phase of the conflict is back on the region where Russia has been fighting Ukraine for the past eight years: Donbas.
Military analyst Michael Kofman wrote on Twitter last week: “The overall military balance in this war still trends in Ukraine’s favour, given manpower availability and access to extensive Western military support … But the local balance in the Donbas during this phase is a different story.”
How fully and how quickly Vladimir Putin attains his objectives in Donbas may dictate how and whether other parts of Ukraine come back into play. The level of losses sustained will also play a role.
Russia has abandoned attempts to encircle all Ukrainian forces in Donbas for the more modest goal of creating “cauldrons” – smaller encirclements cutting Ukrainians off from supplies and reinforcements.
Last week, the focus was on the city of Sievierodonetsk, where local governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia had committed 10,000 soldiers and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment to attacking the city. There are reports that the Russians already control a hotel on the outskirts of the city, after many days of ruthless bombardments.
If Russia takes Sievierodonetsk, it will control the entire Luhansk region, and can increase its focus on parts of Donetsk it still does not control.
“I don’t think the Russian offensive looks stalled, and while sluggish, there is no good way to predict when it will culminate,” wrote Kofman.
There is no longer any doubt that Russia plans to fully annex parts of Ukraine, as it did with Crimea in 2014. Then, Moscow declined to do the same with the areas it controlled in east Ukraine, preferring instead to prop up separatist administrations there. Now, there is talk of rapid annexation of the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces that Russia took in the first days of the invasion.
Unlike Mariupol, which Russia conquered after bombing it to rubble – and possibly other cities in Donbas that Russia may soon capture – these territories were largely taken with no fighting, so Russia has been able to focus on mopping up dissent and trying to take full control.
The areas have seen an increased crackdown on pro-Ukrainian sentiment, as well as reports that Russia is introducing the rouble and Moscow time zone, announcements that teachers will be retrained in the Russian curriculum, and a series of sinister videos of locals announcing on camera that they had been through “a course of denazification” and no longer support Ukraine.
Formal annexation of this territory could have huge consequences for the prospect of a peace deal. Ukraine will not accept the loss of these areas, but if it launches a counterattack, Russia could claim Ukraine was attacking Russian territory.
Life in the Ukrainian capital feels more normal by the week. The occasional air raid siren and men with guns on the streets are reminders of the war, but cafe terraces are busy, the opera has reopened and the curfew has been pushed back to 11pm. Since the Russians withdrew at the beginning of April, there has been no artillery threat, and no repeat of the booms from the suburbs that characterised the first weeks of the war.
However, Russian-language news outlet Meduza last week quoted Kremlin-linked sources claiming that Putin had not yet given up on Kyiv and may launch another assault once the battle for Donbas is over.
As with Kyiv, the Russians attempted to storm the country’s second city in the early days of the war and, as in the capital, they faced unexpectedly strong resistance, were stalled on the outskirts and then pushed back into positions surrounding the city.
In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russians back further but, unlike with Kyiv, the invaders are still within striking distance of the city. Last Thursday, areas within the city limits were shelled for the first time in two weeks and nine civilians died, according to local authorities.
Military commanders say there is no sign of a new advance on Kharkiv, but the Russians are digging firmly into the positions they still hold, with no plans to retreat all the way to the border as they did elsewhere.
“They are planning something,” said one commander based outside the city last week.
“We may only find out what it is when it happens.”"

Now the two female journalists are safe in England but want to continue their work
After 48 days under Russian occupation, they were so used to seeing enemy soldiers on every street corner that they thought the first Ukrainian checkpoint out of Kherson could be a trap. Arriving in a long column of cars, filled mostly with women, babies and pets, Oksana Borisova and Alisa Poliakova (who are speaking under pseudonyms to protect their families still living in occupied territory), didn’t dare trust that they were safe.
For weeks, Russian soldiers had stalked them around the southern Ukrainian city in Z-marked vehicles, destroyed their livelihoods, imprisoned and tortured their friends and lobbed grenades at them at rallies. But after driving past seven Russian checkpoints over 10 hours to Mykolaiv – a journey that prewar would have taken an hour – and surviving a close encounter with a missile, they had finally reached what appeared to be a Ukrainian soldier.
“You understand that it should be our territory, and you see the soldier, but can’t distinguish the military signs on his uniform,” said Borisova, now in the UK, recalling their escape last month. “And you think: ‘Well, Russian or Ukrainian?’”
The confirmation she was looking for came when, the car window lowered to the greeting “dobrogo dnia!” (Ukrainian for “Good day”). She could have hugged him, she said. “Because now I believed that the Ukrainian army exists. Since 24 February we hadn’t seen our soldiers.”
In a series of dispatches for the Observer at the start of the war, the two female Ukrainian journalists bravely documented the horrors of life in occupied Kherson – from the city’s brave resistance to looming humanitarian disaster and burying the dead. But they also offered an insight into how, despite it all, residents fiercely continued to find glimmers of joy: a tale of young hospital interns getting married; drinking coffee at their favourite coffee shop under the roar of artillery strikes. There were scenes of dark humour too. In one dispatch, they described how a queue of civilians laughed a group of empty-handed Russian soldiers out of the butcher’s shop because they were unimpressed with the quality of meat available.
Despite growing numbers of people leaving, the escalating danger – particularly for journalists – and dwindling supplies, the old friends, who are both in their 50s, hadn’t planned to leave their home city.
Despite writing anonymously, they feared being identified by their reporting. One of their friends, Oleh Baturin, was detained and tortured for eight days and threatened with mutilation and death, and Maxim Negrov, the owner of the online newspaper Postfactum, was arrested and detained. They also worried that if the city were liberated it could lead to further killings by Russian soldiers.
But it was only when they were offered seats in friends’ cars that they made the decision to go. Borisova in a car with her daughter-in-law and a baby, and Poliakova with a friend and her cat. Their husbands and sons remain in Kherson.
“I made up my mind very quickly, during half a day,” said Borisova. “Not because of me, more for the sake of my daughter-in-law because my son begged me. Now with all these Bucha stories [of rape], he was very afraid. He said: ‘I will sleep well when you girls get out of Kherson.’” She added: “That chance was given to me and it was too foolish not to take it.”
They left just in time. Just a few days ago, an acquaintance was shot in the head and killed trying to escape. His family were not allowed to bury him. “Now I’m ready to pay any money for my son to leave,” said Borisova. “And I told him frankly: ‘Don’t bargain, pay anything they want, I will get money for you.’” Her mother, who her husband has promised to take care of while she is away, is dying with cancer.
After reaching Mykolaiv, they went to Odesa, which, initially at least, felt like “a resort”. At a cafe, they drank good coffee and ate fish, revelling in the fact that they didn’t have to worry about being harassed by Russian soldiers. But when bombing started, they realised it wasn’t safe there either.
With the help of Christian volunteers, they travelled for free by bus to Germany via Moldova, where they stayed at a shelter for two nights, before reaching Halle where they had been invited to Artist and the City, a residency on the role of public spaces. Last week, they arrived at Stansted under the Homes for Ukraine scheme after a London-based friend found them a host.
After months of communicating online, this is our first time meeting in person. Sat side by side on a sofa in the quiet Surrey suburbs, Poliakova wearing a blue T-shirt and Borisova a hoodie that says “I speak fluent sarcasm” across it, they seem remarkably calm and pragmatic on the surface – direct and quick to laugh and joke – but as they talk the heaviness of their deep pain seeps through.
Although arriving in the UK was in some ways a relief, they continue to suffer from the steady stream of debilitating updates from home via Telegram. “This news makes us anxious, depressed, we cry,” said Borisova. “We cry every day.”
Before the war, their lives in Kherson were busy and full. Borisova travelled throughout Europe, writing about architecture and contemporary art, and Poliakova reported on political and social issues. In the summer, they spent holidays and weekends at the nearby seaside. Now, however, the shore has been mined by Russia.
While it was not very prosperous and had fallen victim to corruption, Kherson was “a cosy city and very warm”, they said, and had potential as a tourist attraction. They had a new mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who they hoped would restore the city with new green zones and public spaces. But after the invasion of Ukraine and a battle for the city, on 2 March Kherson became the first to fall. Kolykhaiev has since been replaced by a pro-Russian administration.
After the Russians arrived, they said, the city was “cut off from the rest of the country immediately”. The television centre was quickly seized and the vast majority of residents did not have time to leave. “The next day we were absolutely sieged.”
Living under occupation, the issue of trust has become a life or death matter. “We stopped talking to anyone, it’s a paranoia,” said Borisova. “You stop believing people.” To illustrate, Poliakova cites the example of a former city manager who was such a convincing patriot with his “perfect Ukrainian”, slogans and speeches but turned out to be a Russian collaborator.
Although for weeks they continued to attend daily protests in the city’s Freedom Square, a sense of escalating threat and distrust was palpable in their occupation diaries and in my communications with them. In one of their final Signal messages before they left, Borisova expressed doubt they would stay alive.
How did their feelings change under occupation? “From great, great fear to some acceptance of reality to total despair, because nothing helps you to accept it really,” said Borisova. She compares waking up under occupation to the film Groundhog Day. “It’s a nightmare and you feel like the day is repeating and repeating.”
The streets were littered with explosives disguised as toys and they were watchful entering their homes. Each day, from around 3pm, the streets would empty out when soldiers started patrolling. People hid in their houses to avoid being shot. “Riding their vehicles around with their machine guns they could be drunk sometimes and just start firing. So it was quite dangerous wandering around in the evening,” said Borisova.
While it was rare to see the Russians engaging in terrible acts in the morning, they could be hungry and angry. “They were told in Russia that we would be happy to have them there. And they couldn’t understand, it was a paradoxical thing for them, that we were not waving flowers and Russian flags.”
For weeks, the Russian response to the daily protests was muted, giving them the confidence to carry on. “It was a very surprising thing for me personally, and for others I suppose, that why they allowed protests so long,” said Borisova, who now sees it as a tactic to paint them as “aggressive Nazis” rising up against “peaceful Russian soldiers”. But on 21 March, the protesters were taken by complete surprise when they were met with grenades. The next day, there was teargas and shooting and Borisova narrowly escaped with her life. Rally numbers dwindled and soon the protests stopped.
“For the first time we saw lots of blood on the ground and we understood it was the end of peaceful rallies,” she said with sombre finality. “They showed us, ‘OK people, we’re fed up with it.’”
Now, they said, life in Kherson is very tough. There are no jobs, Russia has stolen their grain and people are being paid in food instead of money. Meanwhile, the shops are full of expensive food from Moldova and regions of Russia that most couldn’t afford to buy, even if they wanted to.
“For people who stayed there, nothing will help them except themselves,” said Poliakova. “So they start making gardens, orchards near their houses to provide themselves with some food.”
Sometimes medicines are smuggled in, but it’s painfully insufficient.
“So many countries of the world are ready to help us but it’s not very easy to squeeze between all these checkpoints,” said Borisova. “They’re numerous. And sometimes they’re in good mood, sometimes they’re furious, so it’s quite a roulette.”
Trying to escape now can mean spending several days in battlefields surrounded by explosions. “We were lucky to escape within one day,” said Borisova. “But after the roadblocks are getting more and more numerous, people spend two-three days. You’re very, very scared. You are in the centre of the battle.” A ghost city would be bad for Russian propaganda, she said, but not everyone wants to leave. There are those who are prepared to cooperate and are informing on their neighbours.
Although many of its residents speak Russian, the journalists said there has been a sharp rejection of Russia since 2014, when Moscow annexed nearby Crimea, but Russian culture was not cancelled entirely. But now, as she translates the eyewitness accounts of Ukrainian women and girls who have been killed and raped by Russian soldiers for a book about the war, Borisova said she cannot tolerate anything Russian.
“When you come through this terror and see these atrocities … I couldn’t bear it,” she said. “While translating, I was just crying. I stopped for a while to comfort myself but it’s unbearable to read all of this.”
Since arriving in the UK they have been received with warmth and kindness, immediately bonding with their host over their shared love of Monty Python, but it has also been overwhelming. Borisova is trying to see it as an adventure, but Poliakova feels a strong pull back to Ukraine. They want to continue their journalistic work, documenting Ukrainians’ experiences of the invasion and hope to write a book.
“We are very conscious that our psychological conditions are very fragile. Not stable,” said Borisova. But she hopes that every day spent in the UK will help distract them from their grief. “This routine, this desire to see another places, meeting with other people will help us to cope and to overcome.”"

Ukraine is urgently pleading for heavy weapons to repel Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region, as relentless Russian artillery and airstrikes threaten to turn the tide of the war and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping. Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems, which are capable of striking targets up to 300km away, to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that not all the land that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014 can be recaptured militarily. While he is certain his country will take back the territory Russia has claimed since its 24 February invasion, he said other territory could not be recovered by force. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said.
Russia’s defence ministry claims to have captured the strategically important city of Lyman and several other smaller towns and encircled Sievierodonetsk, which Ukraine denies. Zelenskiy said in a Saturday night television address that conditions in Donbas were “indescribably difficult”, and thanked Ukrainian defenders holding out in the face of the onslaught.
At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned Russian oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems, vanishing from the global maps used to locate marine traffic. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich.
Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has scrapped the upper age limit for military recruits in the face of mounting losses in Ukraine, Tass reported. UK intelligence estimated this month Russia had lost about a third of its ground forces.
Officials in the south-eastern port city of Mykolaiv said at least one person was killed, and at least six injured, in Russian shelling. Two rounds landed in courtyards of high-rise buildings, and one shell fell close to a kindergarten, CNN reported.
Boris Johnson and Zelenskiy discussed concerns over food supplies in a phone call. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Zelenskiy the UK would continue to support Ukraine’s armed resistance, including by supplying equipment. She added that the UK was involved in “intensive work … with international partners to find ways to resume the export of grain from Ukraine to avert a global food crisis”.
Putin spoke to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz and, according to the Kremlin, he told them that continuing arms supplies was “dangerous”, warning “of the risks of further destabilisation of the situation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis”. Russia said it was willing to discuss ways to make it possible for Ukraine to resume shipments of grain from Black Sea ports.

Ukraine is in a race against time to save the eastern Donbas region as relentless Russian artillery and air strikes threaten to turn the tide of the war, and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping.
Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk. The rockets would be capable of striking Russian firing positions, military bases, air strips and supply lines at a range of up to 300km (185 miles).
“We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to engage the enemy over a long distance,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said. “The price of delay is measured by the lives of people who have protected the world from [Russian] fascism.”
Ongoing disagreements in Washington have held up MLRS deliveries. Some of President Joe Biden’s national security advisers are said to be fearful Ukraine may use the rockets to hit targets inside Russia, a development that could spark an escalation drawing in the US and Nato. Kyiv has previously launched attacks on Russian soil.
Moscow, keenly aware of the game-changing potential of the rocket systems, has already voiced strong objections. “If the Americans do this, they will clearly cross a red line,” said Olga Skabeeva, an influential Russian state TV host whose views reflect the Kremlin’s. Russia’s response could be “very harsh”, she warned.
US news outlets reported on Saturday that Biden had agreed to provide some rocket systems as part of a major new US arms package for Ukraine to be announced this week. The package may also include another advanced weapon, the high mobility artillery rocket system, known as Himars.
The decision reportedly followed talks between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “Heavy weapons on top of our agenda, and more are coming our way,” Kuleba said after the talks.
But doubts remain about which weapons systems will be provided, and the timing of the US move. The White House and the Pentagon have yet to confirm the reports.
“I won’t get ahead of decisions that haven’t been made yet,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said. Despite the delay, he insisted it was “not too late” to send new weapons to Ukraine.
If the US defies Russia’s warnings and goes ahead this week, the UK is expected to simultaneously announce it will also supply advanced long-range rocket systems. The British version of the MLRS, which can fire 12 missiles in less than a minute, has a more limited range of 84kms (52 miles). Earlier this month, Britain announced an additional £1.3bn in military support.
Speaking in Prague on Friday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was “completely legitimate” for Nato and EU countries to provide more weapons, including tanks and planes, to Ukraine despite Russia’s objections. Like Boris Johnson, Truss says Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, must be seen to lose the war. Britain has demanded a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders.
The UK’s uncompromising stance is not shared by leading European countries shaken by Russia’s advances, whose focus is increasingly on notional peace negotiations. Henry Kissinger, the veteran American diplomat, fuelled this debate last week in Davos by suggesting Kyiv should prepare to make concessions, amounting to a possible de facto partition.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone conversation with Putin, during which they urged the Russian president to hold “direct serious negotiations” with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The French president and German chancellor called for an “immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”.
Keir Giles, of London-based thinktank Chatham House, said a quick end to the conflict appeared to be the priority for France and Germany.
“There are already worrying indications that the flakiest of the western European partners may be discussing between themselves how to force a surrender on Ukraine in the form of territorial concessions in order to end the fighting ... It is more important to them [France and Germany] to end the fighting than to arrive at a workable outcome,” Giles said.
This apparent shift has angered east European governments such as Poland, whose president accused Germany of failing to keep a promise to provide heavy weapons. After Italy last week put forward a peace plan, which was dismissed by the Kremlin as “fantasy”, Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvia’s foreign minister, warned that, in any case, Putin could not be trusted to stick to any settlement.
“Any agreement with Russia isn’t worth a broken penny,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser and peace talks negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. “Is it possible to negotiate with a country that always lies cynically? ... Russia has proved that it is a barbarian country that threatens world security. A barbarian can only be stopped by force.”
Pressure to talk peace or make concessions is feeding Ukraine’s concerns that it is in a race against time to turn around its battlefield fortunes. The Kyiv government said on Saturday that its forces may have to retreat from Luhansk to avoid encirclement.
Russia’s defence ministry said the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman had fallen under the full control of Russian and Russian-backed forces in the region. Meanwhile, a group of independent international legal experts accused Russia of committing genocide.
Notwithstanding recent Ukrainian setbacks, Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, said the west must not back away now.
“Having supported Ukraine and encouraged them to stand up to Russian aggression in the early phase, we’ve now got a real obligation to see it through for the long term,” he said. “It would be disastrous to scale down western support after they’ve done the really hard bit to face the Russians. We’ve got to knuckle down for the long term. Military support can reduce over time and probably the economic support will become more important as the fighting gradually subsides.”"

A London host of a Ukrainian family has written to her local food bank “begging for help” because rising energy costs mean she can no longer afford to feed her new guests.
The Ukrainian family, now coming to a food bank in Euston, north London, every week, is among a growing number of recently arrived refugees from the war-torn country relying on handouts to survive, according to charities.
Helena Aksentijevic, manager of the Euston food bank, said she had been handed the letter by the Ukrainian family. It was from the host and said that they were struggling to cover the extra cost of feeding two women and two children, as well as additional energy costs.
Aksentijevic said the system was “a mess” and that the number of Ukrainian refugees coming to the food bank, which had had a 300% increase in visitors since the start of the pandemic, was rising rapidly.
Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refugees are eligible for a £200 interim payment for subsistence costs, provided by their local council, and can apply for benefits, including universal credit, pension credit, disability benefits, carer’s allowance and child benefit. However, some say their access to benefits has been delayed because they have not yet received biometric residence permits. The government denies this.
Sponsors can claim £350 a month from the government. They do not have to feed refugees, but many do.
Most of the Ukrainians coming to the food banks are women with children, but Aksentijevic said they had also been visited by a teenage boy. “I can only see us getting more and more people from that community,” she said.
The Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) and the Trussell Trust, which between them represent hundreds of food banks, report that newly arrived Ukrainians are seeking help to feed their families.
Ifan said it had created Ukrainian versions of its referral leaflets in the Highlands and Carlisle.
Sabine Goodwin, Ifan’s coordinator, said: “A social security system that is fit for purpose would be able to support Ukrainian refugees struggling to afford food.”
Meanwhile, amid an escalating cost of living crisis, food banks are already struggling to meet the needs of people across the UK. Research by the food network found earlier this month that 93% of its members reported an increase in the need for services since the start of the year, while more than 80% reported issues with food supplies.
Goodwin said that new cost of living crisis measures announced last week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were welcome, but added that “there’s a long way to go before people in the UK can count on accessible financial help at a time of crisis”.
A refugee living alone in emergency accommodation in Exeter said she had visited a food bank after losing her Homes for Ukraine sponsor. She said she was “very well received” and was given help to choose food.
Sutton4Ukrainians, a support group, said that one in three refugees they encounter go to food banks, many because they are waiting to access benefits or because the money they have does not stretch far enough.
A spokesperson said the £200 interim council payment for subsistence was insufficient. “This is not a huge amount – public transport is expensive,” they said, adding that often refugees wanted to be independent.
Lifeafterhummus Community Benefit Society in north London has worked with several Ukrainian refugees who have visited its outdoor surplus food cart. One family said they were being sponsored but that they did not have access to food. Lifeafterhummus has also supplied refugees with cooking equipment.
Farrah Rainfly, the group’s operations manager, said the issue for Ukrainian refugees came on top of the existing cost of living crisis. “I have families coming to me in tears, saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do.’”
A government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these reports – Ukrainians can access benefits immediately without a biometric test and will receive an additional £200 payment while these are being processed.
“Translation services are available to help with phone applications for benefits, welcome points have been set up to help arrivals and we are in constant contact with councils who are providing further support to the small number of Ukrainians who may need more help.”"

In the sparkling azure waters of Antigua, the gleaming £95m superyacht Alfa Nero could be seen at anchor last week by sightseers enjoying the Caribbean coastline. But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find.
Since the invasion of Ukraine, the superyacht, which is linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev, has vanished off the global tracking maps used to locate marine traffic.
An investigation by the Observer this weekend reveals it is one of at least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs which have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich.
At least 13 such vessels with a total value of nearly £2bn have already been impounded since the invasion of Ukraine, from southern France to Fiji. In the latter case, the superyacht Amadea, allegedly linked to the gold billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, was seized on behalf of the US.
Analysts report an increase in Russian-linked yachts which are turning off the automatic identification system (AIS) equipment used for tracking large vessels. The system can be turned off for legitimate reasons, but experts believe some vessels want to avoid detection.
An analysis by the Observer of AIS data compiled by the maritime and aviation market intelligence firm VesselsValue reveals other superyachts which have “gone dark” for more than a month include:
The 72-metre (238ft) superyacht Clio, linked to industrialist Oleg Deripaska, which sailed from the Indian Ocean to Turkey after the invasion. Its last transmitted location was on 18 April in the Black Sea, within range of the Russian ports of Sochi and Novorossiysk.
The 70-metre Galactica Super Nova, linked to the oligarch Vagit Alekperov, the sanctioned former president of Lukoil. The last transmitted location of the vessel was on 2 March off the Croatian coast.
The 140-metre Ocean Victory, linked to the sanctioned oligarch Viktor Rashnikov, which last transmitted its location at anchor in the Maldives on 1 March.
One member of crew on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK told the Observer last week: “We were told to turn off the AIS. We removed the screws on the power plug and pulled it out.”
There are about 9,300 superyachts on the seas, worth more than £50bn, according to industry data. An estimated 10% of that fleet is owned by Russians.
One of the first superyachts to be impounded was the 86-metre Amore Vero, linked to the oil tycoon Igor Sechin, which was seized by customs officers at a shipyard at La Ciotat, near Marseille, on 2 March.
Italian authorities also impounded the 143-metre Sailing Yacht A on 12 March in Trieste. It is believed to be owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Andrey Melnichenko. He was sanctioned by the UK on 15 March.
Melnichenko’s other superyacht, the futuristic £240m Motor Yacht A, has disappeared from global tracking system. Its last confirmed location was on 10 March in the Maldives.
The last recorded location of the Alfa Nero on AIS was in the Caribbean on 3 March, when it was anchored at Philipsburg in Sint Maarten. The yacht is operating on a skeleton crew and has put its tender, the Alfa Fish, into storage.
Guryev, 62, a Russian who made his fortune with the Russian fertiliser giant PhosAgro, is reported by maritime sources to be the owner of the vessel. He was revealed to have bought London’s largest private residence, the 25-bedroom mansion Witanhurst, for £50m in 2008.
He has regularly enjoyed sailing on the Alfa Nero. The vessel is also used by his family, including his son (also Andrey) and his son’s wife, Valeria, who studied at the London College of Fashion and once reportedly stated on Instagram that she was “too pretty for work”. Like many yachts, it is owned via an opaque offshore structure, and Guryev has denied being the owner.
Other yachts which have not been tracked by AIS for more than a month include the Galactica Super Nova, which has a glass-bottomed swimming pool with a waterfall. It left Tivat in Montenegro on 2 March and promptly disappeared off the system.
The Clio, linked to Deripaska, sailed more than 3,000 miles after the invasion, from the Maldives, through the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean and into the Bosphorus, gateway to the Black Sea and its Russian ports. In the Clio’s case, one reason it may have gone dark could be the perilous situation in the Black Sea arising from the war.
Other yachts which have not transmitted a confirmed location via AIS for at least a month include the My Sky, linked to the cigarette tycoon Igor Kesaev, which last reported its location in the Maldives on 30 March. The Maldives has no extradition treaty with the US, and at least five yachts linked to Russian owners have headed for its waters since the invasion. Other vessels, including two owned by Roman Abramovich, have headed to Turkey.
Under maritime rules, AIS should always be in operation when ships are under way or at anchor. All vessels of 300 gross tonnage and upwards must be fitted with it. A cruising vessel will typically transmit its location frequently, but it can turn the system off when in port. The data is relayed by radio receivers and satellites.
Sam Tucker at VesselsValue said: “There are some vessels where we would be previously getting a signal every few minutes from transponders and we are now seeing gaps of months. It’s very likely that some have flicked off the switch and gone into stealth mode.”
None of the sanctioned oligarchs linked to the six superyachts suspected of turning off their AIS responded to a request for comment."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/tv-chief-who-fled-russia-viktor-muchnik;2022-05-28;‘We can’t live with people who support Putin’s war’: the TV chief who fled Russia;"When journalists faced jail for reporting on Ukraine, Viktor Muchnik closed down his Siberian TV station and left for Armenia
On the ninth day of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, editor-in-chief Viktor Muchnik gathered the staff of TV2 for a meeting at their small newsroom in the Siberian city of Tomsk.
New wartime laws meant the whole newsroom risked jailtime for reporting on the conflict, Muchnik told them, and TV2 had just been officially blocked by Russia’s communications watchdog, along with many other independent media outlets.
“All of us who wanted to change things for the better here, at this moment we can feel we have failed,” said Muchnik, reflecting bitterly on his three decades of work at one of Russia’s most resilient media outlets.
The journalists drained glasses of wine, and almost everybody cried. Then Muchnik signed resignation papers for the entire collective. A few days later, he and his wife, Viktoria, who also worked for TV2 for more than a quarter of a century, packed a couple of suitcases and flew out of Russia, probably for ever.
“One reason was professional: the thing you’ve been doing for so long has been killed. The other one was human. Neither of us wanted to be inside this space, in this country which has launched a war, and living among people who support this war,” said Muchnik, in an interview in the Armenian capital Yerevan, where the couple now live, along with tens of thousands of Russians who have fled in the weeks since the war began.
For years, TV2 was an anomaly in the Russian media landscape, an island of media freedom in the Siberian university town of Tomsk. From its chaotic yet idealistic beginnings as the Soviet Union collapsed, through various gritty battles with authorities, culminating in fury, defiance and ultimately defeat, the history of TV2 gives remarkable insight into Russia’s last three decades.
The channel was the brainchild of Arkady Maiofis, a reporter on Soviet television who wanted to create a place for free debate in 1991 as the Soviet Union was on its last legs. At the time, Muchnik was a young history professor attracted by the idea of making political programmes; the first cameraman was a former policeman
“Arkady was the only one who knew anything about television – the rest of us were straight off the street. We had one VHS camera, and we made programmes and took them to the television tower. They put it out for us,” recalled Muchnik.
For entertainment, the channel showed American films: they located pirated cassettes at the market and broadcast them, happily oblivious to copyright concerns.
The channel came into its own in August 1991 during the coup from reactionary forces who wanted to restore hardline Soviet rule. As the central television stations went dark, TV2 journalists got updates by calling friends in Moscow and broadcasting the latest news to viewers in Tomsk. Later, TV2 sent a two-person crew to Moscow to film events. The journalists sent the tapes back with pilots flying to Tomsk.
So it was that television viewers in the heart of Siberia got more relevant information than those watching at home in Moscow, thousands of miles away.
In Boris Yeltsin’s Russia, the channel’s journalists felt they were riding on a wave of freedom. Local politicians did not much like TV2, but they felt obliged to come to the studio for interviews.
But then, when Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, things slowly began to change. “I didn’t like him from the start. I didn’t like his KGB background, I didn’t like his smile and his way of speaking,” said Muchnik.
Gradually, the space for free programming began to shrink. It did not help that the channel was purchased by the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who kept his promise not to interfere in editorial policy but left the authorities suspicious that the channel was his personal mouthpiece.
By this time, TV2 was a media holding with several radio stations and two television channels. A nine-story building to house the media group was under construction when Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 in a sign of Putin’s intention to make sure the oligarchs stayed out of politics.
The channel survived Khodorkovsky’s arrest but the pressure on independent media outlets kept increasing. In 2007, the channel received a series of unofficial warnings from Moscow.
“It was made clear: if you want to attack the mayor, that’s fine; if you want to attack the governor, that’s just about OK, but please don’t attack Putin,” said Muchnik.
”And how are you supposed to leave Putin out of it if you want to do journalism in our wonderful country? If you get into any problem, before long you arrive at the Kremlin, because that’s how the system is built,” he said.
The channel continued to host opposition figures such as Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny, banned from the airwaves of most Russian television stations, when they visited Tomsk.
At the end of 2013, TV2 sent a reporting team to Kyiv to cover the first stirrings of the Maidan revolution, and put out reports on the subsequent annexation of Crimea that had a very different flavour from those on state television.
“Our reporting alienated us not only from the authorities but also part of our audience, who started sending us abuse,” said Muchnik.
A month later, the channel was taken off the air, due to supposed technical problems, and at the end of 2014 it was formally closed down. TV2 went from a media holding with more than 250 employees to a website run by a team of 15 people. Authorities refused to register the website as a media outlet, meaning they were banned from attending press conferences or requesting official commentary.
Despite this, TV2 continued to have impact beyond its modest means. During the Covid pandemic, TV2 journalists received calls from doctors, talking of a catastrophe that state television pretended didn’t exist. People sent footage of patients lying on the floor for a lack of beds.
The site broke several Covid-related stories: a man who dressed up as a doctor to care for his grandmother and recorded the awful conditions in the hospital in the process, and a family who were told their grandmother had died, but when they opened the coffin found the body of a stranger.
Working in these conditions was hard yet possible – but the invasion of Ukraine in February was a game-changer.
A new Russian law about “fakes” meant the entire newsroom could be jailed for their coverage. In these conditions, Muchnik took the decision to close down the station.
“We couldn’t convey to people what was happening in their own country, and that hurts me,” said Alexander Sakalov, a TV2 cameraman. “People don’t want to know. They want flowers and birds. Well, now all the independent media in the country will be closed down, and people will get what they wanted,” he said.
Now, from Yerevan, the Muchniks keep in touch with journalists from other independent regional outlets who have also fled Russia, trying to coordinate future work. They are also working on a project called Witnesses, interviewing Russians on their feelings about the war, and how the decision changed their lives. Some are people who have fled but others are still in Russia, and decline offers to be interviewed anonymously.
“Some people feel it’s important to show their faces despite the risks. If you go to a protest, you can just be arrested and nobody will see you, but this is a way for them to register that they do not agree with this war,” said Viktoria.
Many of the interview subjects told the Muchniks they had fallen out with their own families over their opposition to the war, and Viktoria has had similar difficult conversations with her own mother, who is 82 and mainly watches state television.
“She was so upset when we were leaving. She really wanted us to stay, and she said, ‘Why did you have to talk so much, couldn’t you have just kept quiet?’”
Like many recent Russian emigres, the Muchniks feel bitterly disappointed that their long years of work failed to bring about a different kind of Russia, and saddened that they felt they had no choice but to flee.
They hope they will be able to continue to have an influence on politics in Russia from outside the country, but are adamant that they will not return before there is political change.
“It’s very difficult to exist inside this atmosphere of militaristic hysteria. We will not go back until the collapse of the regime,” said Viktor."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/russia-takes-control-lyman-ukraine-missiles-donbas-region;2022-05-28;Putin defiant as Macron and Scholz call for fresh Ukraine peace talks;"The Russian president warned the French and German leaders it was ‘dangerous’ for the west to supply further weapons to Ukraine
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held a three-way telephone conversation with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday, with the French and German leaders urging Putin to hold “direct serious negotiations” with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The call came as Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s Donbas region continues to grind on. During the 80-minute conversation, the two leaders “insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”, according to a readout from Scholz’s office.
Putin is unlikely to heed such calls. Instead, he warned Macron and Scholz that western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were “dangerous” and risked “further destabilisation of the situation”, according to a Kremlin readout.
Hopes for diplomacy have faded in recent weeks as Russia’s invasion reaches the three-month mark. Although Ukraine is taking heavy losses on the battlefield, there is a widespread belief in the country that agreeing to a negotiated settlement would simply give Russia time to regroup ahead of a further attack.
Russia’s army confirmed on Saturday that it now controls the strategic town of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow’s assault on the Donbas region continues to grind on.
Lyman, a town of 20,000 people, lies on the road to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two of the major Donbas population centres not yet under Russian control.
“The town of Krasny Liman has been entirely liberated from Ukrainian nationalists,” said Russia’s defence ministry in a statement, using the town’s old name.
Ukraine is on the back foot in Donbas, the industrial heartland of the country where Russia-backed forces already seized territory eight years ago and which has now become the centre of Moscow’s Ukraine invasion after the failed attempts to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv.
In his daily video address on Friday evening, Zelenskiy, said the Russians had “concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas”, making life very difficult for the Ukrainian army.
“There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” Zelenskiy said.
Attention this week has been focused on the city of Sievierodonetsk, which if captured would give Russia control of the whole Luhansk region. The city has been under intense artillery and missile bombardment all week, and the Russians have taken control of the Myr hotel on the edge of town.
On Saturday morning, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said the Russians had so far not been able to advance any further than the hotel.
“We have not yet been able to get them out of there, despite their losses. But they are not able to move further either. Their tactics are always the same: a few hours of shelling, and then they try to advance,” he wrote.
Ukraine’s defence minister said foreign military deliveries were helping Ukrainian forces on the frontline, noting three systems that were now in active use against the Russians: M777 and FH70 howitzers as well as the Caesar self-propelled artillery. He also said American M109 howitzer systems had arrived in Ukraine.
“To imagine this back in March would have been impossible. But today it is a reality,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Facebook.
At the same time, Ukrainian officials continue to demand more weapons deliveries from the west, saying they risk being outgunned in Donbas and need the deliveries urgently.
There were reports in Washington that the Pentagon may be preparing to send Ukraine advanced long-range rocket systems to help their battle in the Donbas, something that the Ukrainian army and political leaders have been requesting for months.
Meanwhile, Russian forces also carried out a demonstrative test of a new hypersonic missile on Saturday. The Zircon missile, which was first tested in late 2020, was fired from a frigate in the Barents Sea and hit a target in the White Sea in the Arctic that was 625 miles away, said Russia’s defence ministry.
The Zircon can reach speeds of up to 10-times the speed of sound and flies at a low altitude, making it more difficult to intercept.
Also on Saturday, Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko said he was barred from leaving the country, accusing Zelenskiy of breaking a “political ceasefire” in place since the start of the war. Poroshenko was due to travel to a Nato parliamentary assembly meeting in Vilnius.
Zelenskiy defeated Poroshenko in a 2019 election and before the start of the war prosecutors were investigating Poroshenko over his participation in an allegedly corrupt coal export scheme. Many observers suggested the charges were politically motivated.
After the outbreak of the war, Ukrainian authorities suspended the activities of a number of political parties with pro-Russian platforms, but others were allowed to continue, including Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party. Despite the longstanding acrimony between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko, both appeared to put their quarrels aside to focus on the threat from Russia.
“There is a risk that by this decision, the authorities have broken the ‘political ceasefire’ in place during the war … which one of the pillars of national unity in the face of Russian aggression,” said Poroshenko’s office in a statement."

The son of a Conservative MP has told how he helped save a fellow British volunteer fighter in Ukraine while under heavy Russian gunfire after he was injured by a landmine.
Ben Grant arrived in Ukraine in March, when he told the Guardian he was moved to volunteer after seeing footage of a Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said he went without telling his mother, MP Helen Grant, he was going.
Dramatic video footage, published by the Telegraph, follows the 30-year-old, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a former Royal Marine, screaming: “We’ve got to move now or we’re gonna die!”
Meanwhile, he and others dragged former grenadier guard Dean Arthur to safety after a Russian ambush in a woodland north of Kharkiv earlier this month.
He told the newspaper of his terror, saying: “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”
He said he believes they were spotted by drones beforehand and the Russians had set up their lines so that when they went in, a “mass firefight broke out”.
He added: “I was terrified but driven to complete my most important goal, which at the time was getting him and my team out of the danger.
“What was so scary was being so limited by trying to carry someone, when I can’t pull my weapon up, while there are attack helicopters overhead and tanks firing through the woods. It was unreal – I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”
He said his unit of 15 British and American volunteers and two Ukrainian translators had been preparing an assault on a Russian-held target earlier this month.
The video footage, shot with a helmet-mounted camera, shows them attempting to treat Arthur’s leg with a tourniquet and dressing. They are heard telling him: “You’ve got to try to walk or we’re going to die, mate.”
Arthur lost part of his lower left calf after kneeling on the mine but is now in hospital in Kyiv where doctors saved his leg.
The group were reportedly part of a Ukrainian counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv. In places, they pushed them to the Russian border.
Arthur, 42, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said he was in “excruciating pain”, adding that he was lucky to have escaped alive.
“This type of camaraderie is only forged in these situations. If the coin was flipped, it was one of those guys, I would have got them out,” he said.
The government has advised all British people not to travel to Ukraine, while Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has warned British soldiers they could be prosecuted for desertion if they go to Ukraine to fight.
The Guardian has contacted Helen Grant and the Foreign Office for comment."

An Australian man has died while providing humanitarian aid in war-torn Ukraine, the prime minister has confirmed.
Michael O’Neill, 47, was killed on Wednesday, leaving behind three children as well as five siblings.
“This is a tragedy and I want to give my condolences to the family of the man involved,” Anthony Albanese said in Sydney on Saturday.
“The family has requested that their privacy be respected and I ask the media to do that.”
In a public post on Facebook, one of O’Neill’s sisters said he had been driving trucks in Ukraine to help civilians flee the country as well as helping transport the wounded.
She described her brother as a “larrikin” and “always a battler”.
“Always looking for a cause he headed to Ukraine to drive trucks,” she said.
Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with allegations of war crimes made against the federation’s troops since the invasion.
During his trip to the Quad leaders’ meeting on Tuesday, Albanese said he had expressed Australia’s view that the Russian “unilateral, illegal, immoral attack” on the people of Ukraine was an “outrage”.
“The atrocities which are being committed on innocent civilians is something that we couldn’t have expected in the 21st century,” he told reporters after the meeting.
Earlier this month, the then foreign minister Marise Payne announced further sanctions on high-profile Russians, including media personalities and military higher-ups."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/biden-says-putin-trying-to-wipe-out-ukrainian-culture-as-prospect-of-retreat-looms-in-east;2022-05-28;Biden says Putin trying to ‘wipe out’ Ukrainian culture, as prospect of retreat looms in east;"US president says Putin trying to eliminate people’s identity, as governor of Luhansk says retreat in Sievierodonetsk may be needed to avoid becoming surrounded.
Joe Biden has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to “wipe out” Ukraine’s culture but suggested the plan had at least partially backfired by spurring the expansion of Nato in Europe.
The US president told 1,200 graduating cadets in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday: “Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he’s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people. Attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums, with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.”
The Russian president tried to “Finland-ize” Europe, Biden said, but “instead he Nato-ized all of Europe”, a reference to neutral nations Finland and Sweden’s plans to join the alliance.
On the ground, in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, the situation appeared bleak, with Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, saying Ukrainian forces may need to retreat after Russian troops entered the city, the largest in Donbas still held by Ukraine.
“The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai said on Telegram, referring to Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets river. “We will have enough strength and resources to defend ourselves. However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.”
Haidai said 90% of buildings in the city were damaged.
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accepted the situation in Donbas was “very difficult”, saying in a Friday night address that invading forces “have concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves” to the region.
“There are missiles strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” he said. “We are protecting our land in the way that our current defence resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them.
“If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian.”
Zelenskiy also appealed to European leaders for help with fuel shortages sparked by Russian airstrikes on a refinery in Kremenchuk and on oil depots across the country.
Analysts believe the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed.
Ukraine’s foreign minister offered a bleak assessment of fighting the east. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said.
His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing.
The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told Bloomberg UK that Putin “at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas”. “He’s continuing to make gradual, slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily,” he said.
Russian troops advanced after piercing Ukrainian lines last week in the city of Popasna, south of Sievierodonetsk. Russian ground forces have now captured several villages north-west of Popasna, the UK Ministry of Defence said.
Russia’s eastern gains follow a Ukrainian counter-offensive that pushed Moscow’s forces back from Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv in May. But Ukrainian forces have been unable to attack Russian supply lines to the Donbas.
On Friday, the Moscow branch of Kyiv’s Orthodox church said it was cutting ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, declaring “full independence” in a historic move against Russia’s spiritual authorities.
“We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow ... on the war,” the church said in a statement after holding a council focused on Russia’s “aggression” and declaring the “full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox church”.
“The council condemns war as a violation of God’s commandment ‘You shall not kill!’ and expresses condolences to all those who are suffering in the war,” it said.
Patriarch Kirill has expressed clear support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
It said its relations with the Moscow leadership had been “complicated or absent” since martial law was declared in Ukraine.
The council also appealed to both Ukraine and Russia to “continue the negotiation process” and find a way to “stop the bloodshed”.
Speaking to AFP, church spokesman Archbishop Kliment said of Patriarch Kirill: “Not only did he fail to condemn Russia’s military aggression but he also failed to find words for the suffering Ukrainian people.”
The Russian Orthodox church said it had “not received an official statement from the Ukrainian Orthodox church” and was unable to comment, spokesman Vladimir Legoida wrote on Telegram.
He said the Ukrainian Orthodox church was in “a very difficult position and under pressure from many directions: from the authorities, from schemers, from nationalistic-minded people ... and the media”.

The gloating began just days after the missiles began falling on Ukraine. “Get ready for Nuremberg 2.0,” one former Russian diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message. Vladimir Putin’s invasion to “denazify” the country has always pointed toward a purge and show trials. Now Moscow may seize on that chance.
As Russia holds hundreds of prisoners from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, its proxies in east Ukraine have floated the idea of holding a “military tribunal” inspired by Nuremberg that observers say would reflect a mass show trial meant to justify Russia’s invasion to the world.
“We are planning to organise an international tribunal on the republic’s territory,” said Denis Pushilin, the leader of a Russian-controlled territory in the Donetsk region. A model could be the Kharkiv trial of 1943, he said, when the Soviet military tried, convicted and executed three Germans and one Ukrainian by hanging. One key audience was the world press. Photos of the hangings were printed in Life magazine.
Whether the Kremlin will follow through with such a gruesome spectacle remains unclear, but the idea has found backers in the foreign ministry and among top MPs who have angrily declared that there should be no prisoner exchanges of the soldiers captured in Mariupol. The head of annexed Crimea said that a tribunal in Russian-occupied east Ukraine, where local authorities support the death penalty, would serve as a “lesson for everyone who forgot the lessons of Nuremberg”.
The signalling of a great political trial has raised fears that Russia is about to pass yet another grisly landmark in its reliving of the second world war, simulating a triumphant legal process that would taint the legacy of the Nuremberg verdict. One expert called it an Orwellian distortion of the postwar language of human rights.
It would be “a political trial whose aim is to present a particular narrative about the war that supports the argument about denazification that Putin has been putting forward, that supports his claim that Ukraine is being run by Nazis and that supports his claims that there are direct links between the Ukrainian collaborators during the second world war and Ukrainian soldiers today”, said Francine Hirsch, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal after World War II.
“I think it’s going to be used to try to present what we in the west understand as a fiction as if it’s a reality. That’s what show trials do.”
With a growing focus on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including an international investigation into the massacre of civilians in towns such as Bucha, some observers believe that Moscow may launch a military tribunal as a counter-process as more atrocities are revealed.
“They’re trying to create a counterbalance because of all the talk of the international criminal court and the Ukrainian prosecutions” for war crimes said Philippe Sands, a professor of law at University College London and author of East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity.
“I suspect … they’re creating another form of leverage for what’s going to come in due course.”
Sands has been part of an effort now under discussion to form a special criminal tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression, a charge that was originally coined at the Nuremberg trials of 1945-46 by a Soviet lawyer as “crimes against peace”.
He said there was an irony to Russia’s embrace of a Nuremberg-style process that would ignore any charges for launching an illegal war against Ukraine.
“For me, the crime of aggression is the beating heart of this whole issue,” said Sands. “At the end of the day, if Putin had not gone to war, none of the other crimes would have taken place.”
As part of the history of the second world war, the Nuremberg trials remain a deeply personal issue for the Kremlin. The decision to propose a military tribunal is a dive deeper into what one former adviser called a historical “mania”, where terms like “denazification” are seen as having the potential to mobilise the Russian public.
The Kremlin “thinks this is what the public wants to see … to feel themselves a part of history”, said the former adviser, who has worked with Putin.
He also said he believed that senior officials had bought into their own propaganda about the resurgence of nazism in the west.
History appears to be the wellspring for both the Kremlin’s propaganda and state policy. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council and a top Putin ally, said in an interview this week that its policies for the “denazification” of Ukraine were exactly the same as in Nazi Germany in 1945.
“It’s fanaticism,” the adviser said.
The Nuremberg trials that convicted Nazi war criminals reflected the political divisions of the times. Western representatives were concerned that the Soviets treated them as a repeat of their own show trials of the 1930s. The Soviet judges were appalled when Winston Churchill gave his famous “iron curtain” speech about the menace of communism while the trial was in progress.
Today, Russia has wielded the trial as a shield against accusations of the crimes under Stalin. After the European parliament condemned Russian state propaganda in 2019 for “whitewashing communist crimes and glorifying the Soviet totalitarian regime”, Putin shot back that the statement “challenged the conclusions of the Nuremberg trials” and could “undermine the foundations of the entire postwar Europe”.
“There’s a narrative about Nuremberg that has become really significant. It’s a narrative where the Soviets are the heroes and the Soviets are the victims but they weren’t responsible for any kinds of crimes,” said Hirsch. “There’s a way in which Nuremberg has really become a part of Russia’s patriotic education.”
Now there are new concerns that Russia could use a tribunal modelled on a glorious past to whitewash its new invasion of Ukraine.
“If these kinds of things happen we need to be ready for it and journalists need to really think about how do you cover this,” said Hirsch. “How do you cover something that you know is play-acting but is deadly?”"

Russia is planning a “full-scale victory in Ukraine by autumn” and may again try to take the capital city of Kyiv, according to independent news source Meduza. Officials close to the Kremlin have said confidence has spread to the leadership of United Russia, the country’s ruling party, that a full-scale victory in Ukraine is possible before the end of the year.
The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. “The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” the governor of Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. The Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire.
The Luhansk governor has said Ukrainian forces may be forced to retreat from the zone to avoid being captured. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai posted on Telegram, adding: “However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.”
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the situation in Donbas is “very difficult”. In a short video address, he said Russian forces are concentrated in the coastal region of Ukraine and using “maximum artillery” reserves.
The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has stated that Vladimir Putin is “prepared to discuss a prisoner swap with Ukraine”, after holding talks with the Russian president. Nehammer also said Putin had “given signals that he is quite willing to allow exports via the seaports”, adding: “The real willingness will only become apparent when it ... is actually implemented.”
Russia expects to receive 1tn rubles ($14bn) in additional oil and gas revenues this year, the country’s finance minister announced, noting that the additional income will be spent on Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
The US president, Joe Biden, accused Putin of attempting to “wipe out” Ukrainian culture and identity during a speech. Biden also said that Putin inadvertently “Nato-ized all of Europe” after Sweden and Finland sought out membership in the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The US is expected to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine that could be announced as early as next week, reports CNN. The rocket systems, multiple launch rocket system or MLRS, have been a top request of Ukraine officials who say it is necessary to ward off Russia’s advancements.
More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show.

Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion.
Peter Beaumont reported this week on Russia’s advances in the Donbas region, with Ukrainian officials admitting that Moscow has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east as defending forces fell back from some of their positions.
Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken, Ukraine’s general staff said that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, which makes up the southern part of the Donbas, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago.
Ukraine’s president has also given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by his forces in the Donbas. “Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.
Shaun Walker has written about the horrors endured by Mariupol’s remaining residents, following the end of Russia’s devastating months-long siege of the city.
He spoke to Svitlana and Vitaly, a couple who lost almost everything, including their unborn baby, before being forced into a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia.
“There’s nothing there,” Vitaly said bitterly. “Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.”
Meanwhile, Andrew Roth reported on Russia’s deployment of mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine.
“The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”.
As prosecutors investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw, and photographer Alessio Mamo revealed the evidence they discovered on the ground: cluster bombs, fléchettes and unguided missiles on residential areas.
On 1 March, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era FAB-250 bombs over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv – explosives designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew.
Bellingcat, a not-for-profit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian and confirmed the presence of cluster bombs in towns and villages occupied by the Russians. The weapons, banned in more than 100 countries (but not the US, Russia or Ukraine) were unleashed in areas with no military personnel and no military infrastructure.
Lorenzo Tondo met Ivan Mishchenko, a farmer in a small village north of Kyiv whose plight mirrors that of hundreds like him and has worsened food insecurity around the world.
Their businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, Mishchenko’s few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling.
“The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” Mishchenko said.
Daniel Boffey reported on eight-year-old Tymofiy Seidov, the last child in a ruined village in north-east Ukraine to be evacuated with his family from the basement in which they lived for three months, after a benefactor read of their plight in the Guardian.
Tymofiy did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, owing to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova.
The family’s evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/russia-guilty-inciting-genocide-ukraine-expert-report;2022-05-27;Russia is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, expert report concludes;"Report by 30 internationally recognised scholars finds ‘reasonable grounds to conclude’ Moscow in breach of Geneva Convention
Russia is guilty of inciting genocide and having the intent to commit genocide in Ukraine, legally obliging other countries to stop it, according to a new report by more than 30 internationally recognised legal scholars and experts.
The report, compiled by two thinktanks, the New Lines Institute in Washington and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights in Montreal, found that there were “reasonable grounds to conclude” that Russia is already in breach of two articles of the 1948 Genocide Convention, by publicly inciting genocide, and by the forcible transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which the report notes is itself a genocidal act under article II of the convention.
The report concludes there is “a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all states to prevent genocide” under the convention. States will not be able to say they were unaware of the risk, it warns, but neither the report nor the 1948 convention stipulates what actions foreign governments should take. The report just notes “a minimum legal obligation on states to take reasonable action to contribute toward preventing genocide and protecting vulnerable Ukrainian civilians from the imminent risk of genocide”.
Joe Biden labelled Russian atrocities in Ukraine as genocide in April, and some other governments have followed suit, though the state department said it was ultimately up to a court to determine. The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, Karim Khan, is leading an investigation of war crimes and has the authority to bring charges of genocide if he feels there is evidence of intent to “destroy, in whole or in part”, the Ukrainian people.
“I’ve never seen anything like this report this early during a conflict,” said Tanya Domi, one of the expert contributors to the report, and an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs. “I think the documentation of crimes in Ukraine outstrips anything that we’ve seen in the recent past.”
The report finds ample evidence of incitement to genocide, noting the Kremlin leadership and Russian state media commentators have consistently denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity, “implying that those who self-identify as Ukrainian threaten the unity of Russia or are Nazis, and are therefore deserving of punishment”.
“Denial of the existence of protected groups is a specific indicator of genocide under the United Nations guide to assessing the risk of mass atrocities,” the report said.
It also looked at the language used by Russian officials depicting Ukrainians as somehow subhuman, with terms like “zombified”, “bestial” or “subordinate”, or as diseased or contaminated, using words like “scum” and “filth”.
“What they’re saying is: if you’re Ukrainian you’re a Nazi, and therefore we’re going to kill you,” Domi said. “They are saying this is a Nazi regime and that means that they are pursuing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian state for the purposes of elimination and destruction.”
By issuing blanket denials of the atrocities and by rewarding soldiers suspected of mass killings, as Putin did with the units that were in Bucha at the time of the mass killings of civilians there, the Kremlin is enabling Russian forces to commit more war crimes and conditioning the Russian public to condone them, the report said.
The public incitement at the time of the invasion points towards a genocidal plan, the experts argue, as does the pattern of atrocities committed: the mass killings, the shelling of shelters and evacuation routes, and the indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas.
In that category, the report points to the sieges of cities such as Mariupol, the 248 attacks on Ukraine’s healthcare system documented by the World Health Organization, and the destruction or seizure of basic necessities, humanitarian aid and grain.
A systematic pattern of rape and sexual violence is also part of an overall picture of atrocities that point towards genocidal intent, the experts said, as is the forcible transfer of over a million people to Russia, including more than 180,000 children. The report cites Ukrainian officials as pointing to planned reforms in Russian legislation to accelerate adoption procedures for children from the Donbas, while abducted Ukrainian children have been forced to take Russian classes.
“I think the forced transfers of people is just one of the most egregious crimes because that shows intent to remove them from their country. There is no ability of those individuals to resist,” Domi said.
The international court of justice ruled in 2007 that state parties to the Genocide Convention had an obligation to take preventive action when they learn of, or should have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.
“Each state then will determine whether it has the means to help deter those suspected of preparing genocide and take action as the circumstances permit,” David Scheffer, a former US ambassador at large for war crimes issues and now a senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. “There are many options: provision of military weaponry, humanitarian and refugee aid, economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and even military intervention, that complies with the UN Charter.”"

The besieged city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. Russia has continued to make incremental gains in the Donbas region, backed by shelling. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces have surrounded two-thirds of Sievierodonetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east. He said Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality it would probably be necessary to end the war. Russia did not appear to be ready for serious peace talks, he added.
More than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts concluded that Russia is inciting genocide in Ukraine and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people. Their independent report accused the Russian state of violating several articles of the UN Genocide Convention, according to CNN.
The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for frozen peace talks, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the leadership in Kyiv of making “contradictory statements” that do “not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants”.
Ukrainian authorities have issued contradictory statements about their control over the strategic city of Lyman in  Donetsk. A presidential adviser said he had unverified information that Ukraine had lost Lyman, while Ukraine’s armed forces said Russian troops were trying to strengthen their positions in the city. The governor of the region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence. Russian media reported that pro-Russian separatists had seized the city.
Ten people were killed and at least 35 were injured after Russian missile strikes hit the Dnipropetrovsk region in central-eastern Ukraine on Friday morning, according to reports. Regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said rescuers were working in the rubble to look for possible survivors in the aftermath of “an unquiet night and an unquiet morning”.
The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia was making “slow but palpable progress” in Donbas. He said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems to help Kyiv’s embattled forces, but stopped short of committing the UK to send the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks.
Kharkiv was hit by new strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 were injured, authorities said. Residents have been urged to shelter. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said “doctors are providing all necessary assistance” and that there were no further casualties overnight.
Officials in Ukraine have admitted  Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region said only 5% of the area remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas."

After several weeks of deadlock, Russia’s military appears to have found a way to advance in the Donbas – pounding it with such intense, unsophisticated artillery that Ukraine’s exhausted defenders are having to yield.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy rarely gives casualty figures but Ukraine’s president said last Sunday that “50 to 100 Ukrainian troops die on Donbas frontlines each day”, meaning perhaps 3,000 a month in the grisly war of attrition.
Wounded will typically be three or perhaps four times as much, a serious loss for a Donbas defence force estimated at 30,000 before the war began, although the numbers increased following Ukraine’s mass mobilisation.
“Russian forces have secured more terrain in the past week than efforts earlier in May,” reported the Institute for the Study of War on Tuesday, in particular approaching the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and in villages nearby.
“The shelling of Sievierodonetsk is growing exponentially,” said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, which is now 95% controlled by the Russians. He estimated 10,000 Russian troops and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment had been committed to the attack.
The Russian advances are not dramatic but they reflect a new strategy. Gone for now are the attempts at wider encirclements of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, which included a failed river crossing in early May. Instead units are focused on smaller encirclements – or “cauldrons” – and a sheer concentration at Sievierodonetsk.
That was confirmed by the militia head of the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republic in Donetsk, Eduard Basurin, who said Russian forces had adopted an approach of creating smaller encirclements to deprive Ukrainian troops of logistics and reinforcements, rather than pursuing a single large one.
Russian efforts in the Donbas have also been aided by shorter supply lines over the border into Russia as well as a dense network of railway lines in the parts of Luhansk occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014. And forces previously thrown into the failed attempt to take Kyiv continue to arrive.
It follows the appointment by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of Gen Aleksandr Dvornikov to lead the fight. Infamous as the “Butcher of Syria” he also commanded a motor rifle division that devastated Grozny in the late 1990s. Dvornikov has brought the same tactics to Ukraine.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the Russians had engaged in “progressive reorientation of their operations towards increasingly modest objectives” allowing them to take villages such as Popasna and Rubizhne, although he argued “their ground forces are still performing badly” as demonstrated by the reliance on artillery.
Others are not so sure. An anxious Kyiv continues to plead with the west for more powerful weapons. The latest demand is for M270 long-range multiple rocket launchers. On Friday, after a to and fro lasting several weeks, it appears the US now appears to be willing to provide some, after previously refusing.
The M270 comes in many versions but it can use missiles with a range of over 100 miles (165km), while the British version has a limit of 52 miles. Both are well beyond anything Ukraine has and would be a significant addition to Kyiv’s arsenal at a time when the country continues to have a pressing requirement for western arms.
When asked what Ukraine needed at present, Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP visiting the UK, said “the first and the foremost is weapons always”, arguing her country and the west “should not underestimate Russia right now” just because Moscow’s forces had, until earlier this week at least, made limited progress in the Donbas.
Rudik said she spoke to Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline every day. But an ongoing problem, she acknowledged, was that it can take two months or more for promised western weaponry to arrive, another reason why Russia may be enjoying a tactical advantage.
Ukraine’s fundamental problem is that while it may have fought off the attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the first phase of the three month-long war, it has not been able to reverse Russia’s territorial gains in the south and east.
That means it has incurred human and economic losses far greater than Russia. Nearly 13 million people have been displaced by the fighting, the UN estimates. Its economy is set to fall 45% this year, according to the World Bank, and the country cannot balance its books. Its strategic exports of grain – 99% of which used to travel by ports blockaded or held by Russia – lie in silos where 22m tonnes are at risk of rotting.
Meanwhile, it may have taken three months for Russia to take the port of Mariupol, ruining and depopulating the city in the process, but this week minesweepers were clearing the beaches and the port, which Moscow hopes to reopen to create a fresh supply line from Russia to the occupied south.
A threat for Ukraine remains western fatigue, or a loss of unity, particularly if a largely stalemated war drags on towards next year. Countries traditionally less hostile to Russia may follow the suggestion of the veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger at the Davos summit this week, to consider pressing Ukraine to agree to a partition.
There are signs Russia is happy with the current pace. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, claimed on Tuesday the offensive was being slowed “deliberately in order to avoid civilian casualties” – and while there is plenty of evidence to the contrary about harm to ordinary Ukrainians from Russian shelling, it also suggests a country being prepared for a longer war.
Phil Osborn, a former head of UK defence intelligence, said the military situation was such that Ukraine needed as much help as it could get.
“The west must focus unremittingly on Ukraine and be prepared for pain. Putin calculates that we will be increasingly distracted (just look at the news cycle moving on and the ‘reasonable’ voices nudging Zelenskiy to settle) and that he has more patience than the west.”"

Boris Johnson has said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to help Kyiv’s embattled forces prevent Russian invaders from gaining ground in the Donbas.
But the prime minister stopped short of committing the UK to sending the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks.
Johnson said the MLRS would enable Ukraine “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go” in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
He added that Putin’s forces were “continuing to chew through ground” in the Donbas region, making “slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress” as they close in on Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukraine.
Johnson’s comments appear to confirm that there has been a significant change of stance over the weapons among western nations.
The US previously rejected Ukraine’s request for the long-range rockets but overnight, briefings suggested that the White House was now willing to supply them. An announcement could come next week, CNN reported, for a weapon that could have a significant impact on the fighting.
Far more powerful than conventional artillery, M270 MLRS rockets have a maximum range of more than 100 miles (165km) and up to 12 projectiles a minute can be fired from an armoured vehicle. Their firepower goes far beyond the original commitment made by Nato members to only send “defensive systems” to Ukraine when the war began.
The British M270 has a range of 52 miles although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles. Ukraine’s existing conventional artillery has a maximum range of roughly 15 miles, including the M177 howitzers supplied by the US army to help fend off the Russians in Donbas.
The surface-to-surface rockets are made by Lockheed Martin and have been bought by the US, UK and nearly 30 other countries. Some smaller countries had been willing to send MLRS weapons via larger third countries, but to the frustration of the Ukrainians the larger nations had not been willing to go ahead.
Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP with the centrist Golos party, said on a visit to the UK that Ukraine was in need of more powerful arms. “There’s this discussion of getting us more MLRS systems. I know that the British government is right now deciding on if they can get to us from the United Kingdom and that will be fantastic. That is something that we exactly need right now,” she said."

More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show, in what looks to be the clearest indication yet of dissent among some parts of security forces over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, came to light on Wednesday, after a local Russian court rejected their collective lawsuit that challenged their earlier sacking.
According to the court’s decision, published on its website, the lawsuit was dismissed after the judge determined that the soldiers had been rightfully fired for “refusing to perform an official assignment” to fight in Ukraine and instead returned to a duty station.
The appeal took place in Nalchik, the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian republic in the Russian Caucasus, where the unit is based.
Since Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, its military has reportedly been plagued by poor morale, with reports of soldiers claiming they did not know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine.
The Pentagon said this month that it had seen “anecdotal reports” that “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level”, had “either refused to obey orders” or were not obeying them with the expected measure of “alacrity”.
Andrei Sabinin, the lawyer who represented the 115 soldiers, said the court’s decision was “unprecedentedly quick” given the complexity of the case.
“I express doubts about the fairness of the process as a whole because my clients were denied to call up certain witnesses and several documents were rejected by the court.”
According to Sabinin, the commanders of the Rosgvardia unit offered the soldiers the option not to fight and their dismissal was illegal.
Russia created Rosgvardia, a militarised force separate from the army, in 2016 to fight terrorism and maintain public order. Since its inception, members of Rosgvardia, which is often referred to as Vladimir Putin’s “private army”, have mostly been involved in crackdowns on peaceful anti-government protests.
Military analysts have linked Russia’s heavy use of Rosgvardia soldiers in Ukraine to Moscow’s strategic aims of capturing and holding major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and the capital, Kyiv. These plans failed, while Rosgvardia units suffered heavy casualties after Ukrainian cities remained battlegrounds rather than being captured by Russia, which left Rosgvardia units exposed to Ukrainian attacks.
Documents acquired by the Guardian on Friday from a separate criminal case against a Siberian journalist further reveal Rosgvardia’s role in Ukraine.
Mikhail Afanasyev, the chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces last month over the website’s reporting on a separate Rosgvardia unit that also refused deployment to Ukraine.
Court testimonies given by members of the Rosgvardia unit mentioned in Afanasyev’s reporting confirm earlier reports that 11 Rosgvardia from Khakassia refused to fight.
The testimonies also give weight to suggestions that the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine was intended initially as a blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv with the aim of capturing the capital.
In one testimony, a Roskgvardia soldier told the court that his commander instructed his unit three days prior to the invasion that they would be sent to Ukraine to “patrol the streets and intersections of Kyiv”.
“The commander explained that all employees of the national guard and the Russian armed forces were assigned specific tasks during the special operation in Ukraine. The task of our detachment and for all the other detachments that were stationed with us was to guard the streets and intersections of Kyiv,” said the testimony, seen by the Guardian.
The content of the court documents was first reported by the regional independent outlet Tayga.info.
A month into the war, Moscow was forced to switch its offensive to more limited objectives after running into fierce Ukrainian resistance, with the army prioritising what it calls the “liberation” of the Donbas region.
But despite a recent string of military successes in the Donbas, the Kremlin this week was confronted with two incidents of rare public dissent from Russian officials.
On Wednesday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war, publishing a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster.” And on Friday, two communist lawmakers from the Khabarovsky Krai in the far east of Siberia urged Putin to end the Ukraine conflict.
“If our country does not halt the military operation then there will be even more orphans in our country,” lawmaker Leonid Vasyukevich said, according to a video of the meeting.
“During a military operation, people become disabled. These are young people who could be of great use to our country,” he added. “We demand an immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops.”

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/russian-forces-sievierodonetsk-eastern-ukraine-donbas;2022-05-27;Russian forces close to encircling Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine;"Situation in Donbas ‘even worse than people say it is’, says Ukraine’s foreign minister, as Kremlin makes further gains
The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces, as the Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire.
“The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. “The residents of Sievierodonetsk have forgotten when was the last time there was silence in the city for at least half an hour.”
As the cities of Kharkiv to the north and Dnipro to the south also came under attack, analysts said the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed.
Underlining the state of the fighting in Donbas, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has cast himself as one of Ukraine’s most vocal cheerleaders, said Russia was making slow but “palpable progress”, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east.
Ukraine’s foreign minister also offered a bleak assessment. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said.
His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems Kyiv for which has been appealing.
On Friday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in Prague that it was appropriate to support Ukraine with tanks and planes if necessary.
Amid the increasingly gloomy news from the campaign in the east, where Ukrainian defenders have been forced to retreat from some positions, Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality that this would probably be necessary to end the war.
“There are things to discuss with the Russian leader. I’m not telling you that to me our people are eager to talk to him, but we have to face the realities of what we are living through,” Zelenskiy said in an address to an Indonesian thinktank.
“What do we want from this meeting? … We want our lives back … We want to reclaim the life of a sovereign country within its own territory,” he said, adding that Russia did not appear to be ready yet for serious peace talks.
In reply, the Kremlin said on Friday it blamed Ukraine for the fact that peace talks between the two countries were frozen, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a call with reporters: “The Ukrainian leadership constantly makes contradictory statements. This does not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants.”
The situation in Sievierodonetsk appeared particularly desperate, with Russian troops reported in some parts of the city.
Its mayor said Russian forces were in the Myr hotel on Thursday, on the city’s outskirts, and that 1,500 people had died in the fighting, while between 12,000 and 13,000 were trapped.
Russia appeared to have gained full control of the strategic town of Lyman, with the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, saying there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence.
Pro-Russia separatists in the Donetsk region said they had “liberated and taken full control of 220 settlements, including Krasny Liman”, using an old name for Lyman.
According to some reports, Ukraine has been increasingly forced to plug the gaps among its defenders in Donbas with volunteers, highlighting the increasing stress on its forces in the region.
Oleh Synehubov, the regional governor of Kharkiv, which lies to the north of Donbas, said nine civilians had been killed in Russian shelling on Thursday.
A five-month-old child and her father were among the dead, while her mother was gravely wounded, he said on social media channels.
An Agence France-Presse reporter in the city said the northern residential district of Pavlove Pole was hit and plumes of smoke rose from the area.
The journalist saw several people wounded near a shuttered shopping centre, while an elderly man with injuries to his arm and leg was carried away by medics.
Commentators believe that Russia’s gains in the three months of war have been far more paltry than Putin originally hoped for, although Moscow has gained control over a handful of cities in southern Ukraine, such as Kherson and Mariupol.
That has been cited as the explanation for the intensity of the Russian effort to take the entirety of Donbas, in what could be painted as a major victory for Putin.
The Kremlin is seeking to tighten its grip over the parts of Ukraine it occupies, including fast-tracking citizenship for residents of areas under Russian control.
The occupying authorities in Mariupol, which was taken over by invading forces this month after a devastating siege that left thousands dead and reduced the city to rubble, have cancelled school holidays to prepare students to switch to a Russian curriculum, according to Kyiv.
Whether Russian forces can advance beyond Donbas and the areas in the south they control is more questionable."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/27/ukraine-russia-looting-museums;2022-05-27;‘Ukraine’s heritage is under direct attack’: why Russia is looting the country’s museums;"2,000 stolen artworks attest to Putin’s desire to erase a nation’s history – like so many despots before him
As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the director of the Museum of Local History in Melitopol in the south-east of the country, Leila Ibrahimova, arranged for a hoard of gold artefacts from ancient Scythia to be hidden. Just a few weeks later, she was kidnapped and interrogated by Russian troops. They demanded to know where the Scythian gold was; she refused to cooperate. Subsequently the museum’s curator Galina Andriivna Kucher was taken at gunpoint to the museum and asked to show a Russian “expert” and agents where the gold was. She also refused to locate the collection. Kucher was later abducted from her home on 30 April and her whereabouts remains unknown.
According to a report on the theft in the New York Times, Russian troops eventually found the gold hoard, which dates back to the fourth century BC, boxed up in the museum’s basement. The items were taken to Donetsk, in the Russian-controlled Donbas region, for “safety”, with the museum’s newly installed puppet director, Evgeny Gorlachev, stating that the gold artefacts were not just for Ukrainians but “of great cultural value for the entire former Soviet Union”. His carefully chosen words were designed to erase the collection’s Ukrainian heritage and replace it with a Soviet one, one that suggested Ukraine was back within Russia’s sphere of influence and control.
To date, Russian forces have caused the destruction or severe damage of 250 museums and institutions in Ukraine. Twenty-five paintings by Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko were incinerated after the Museum of Local History in Ivankiv was hit by a missile. The Arkhip Kuindzhi museum in the besieged city of Mariupol was badly damaged by an airstrike that left paintings exposed to the elements, hanging on walls amid piles of rubble. The Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, run by the Virginia Museum of Natural History in association with the Smithsonian, has already logged more than 110 memorials destroyed by Russian weapons. But as well as destroying museums and galleries, Russian troops are accused of having stolen an estimated 2,000 artworks. In addition to the theft of the Scythian gold in Melitopol, in Mariupol a handwritten Torah scroll and a valuable gospel printed in Venice in 1811 were all have been taken.
Autocratic leaders seizing art as a means to rewriting a nation’s cultural history and advance their interests is nothing new: in 1937, Hitler confiscated 17,000 works of art from more than 100 German museums in less than a month. Some were shown in his Degenerate Art exhibition but many were destroyed or “lost”. Napoleon had cartloads of masterpieces shipped to Paris from all over Europe: the classical sculptures Apollo Belvedere and Laocoön from Italy; Rubens’s The Descent from the Cross from Belgium. But these latest thefts are in keeping with Putin’s attempts to erase Ukraine’s independent history and promote his own expansionist model of a new Russian empire.
It is clear that Putin sees the Scythian gold as particularly central to Ukraine’s cultural identity and independence. It is not the first time he has tried to claim it for Russia. In 2014, examples of Scythian gold were on loan to the Allard Pierson museum in Amsterdam. Four of the Ukrainian museums that had issued the loans were in Crimea. As Putin invaded and annexed Crimea, he pressed the Netherlands to send the gold back. A protracted legal battle ensued and only in October 2021 did a judge finally rule that the works categorically belonged to the State Museum Fund of Ukraine and not the Russian-controlled Crimean museums (the works remain in the Dutch museum’s stores).
When the paintings that were forcibly removed from Mariupol are also considered, a clear pattern emerges. These works have been chosen to undermine Ukraine’s national identity. Paintings by western European artists have not been targeted, for example. Instead it is the work of Ukrainian-Russian artists that has been stolen. Take 19th-century maritime painter Ivan Aivazovsky. Born in Feodosiya, a Crimean port, he was a leading Romantic artist who painted heavy seas, golden sunsets and storm-tossed ships. The slightly younger Arkhip Kuindzhi, another whose works were taken, was born in Mariupol. His paintings are the calm before Aivazovsky’s storm: landscapes of harmonious tranquillity. Both painters worked in regions that are now in modern-day Ukraine and Russia, and both countries claim the artists as their own. Other works stolen are by Tetyana Yablonska (1917–2005), a politically active Ukrainian painter who was born in Smolensk, Russia, and Mykola Hlushchenko (1901–1977), who lived in Donetsk from an early age but was likewise born in Russia. Russia’s line of thinking seems to be that if it seizes such paintings by Ukrainian-Russian artists then the contested territory they once called home will follow.
There is hope, however. The resilience Ukraine is showing in the war is mirrored by the country’s response to this parallel attack on its culture. At the Venice Biennale, the exhibition This Is Ukraine was crowded with artists, with President Zelenskiy’s handwritten slogan “We are defending our freedom” adorning the side of the building. One of the artists involved, Nikita Kadan, created a work from war-damaged metal shards collected from Donbas during the war of 2014 and the current onslaught. He uses his Instagram account to record damage to Ukrainian museums but also to show how the country is protecting its cultural assets, posting photographs of monuments across the country, wrapped in blankets and tape or surrounded by hundreds of sandbags. All Ukrainians are aware that their heritage is under direct attack.
This article was amended on 31 May 2022 to remove a text assertion that a breastplate (pectoral) was the centrepiece of Melitopol’s collection. In fact, this item is in the Scythian collection of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine, Kyiv, so contrary to a caption was not among objects looted.

But can they really help?
On the second floor of the stately King’s College London building on the Strand, Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Joe Biden are sitting around a table studying a map of Ukraine. They are here to negotiate the future of the country, but they all have ulterior objectives too. Germany wants to ensure the safe transit of refugees; the US wants Russia to cease its disinformation campaign; France wants trade; and Russia needs dozens of sanctions to be lifted. But nobody is giving anything away. It’s tense as hell and the clock is ticking.
This is not real, of course, it’s just a game – but it’s a game with serious intentions. Today, the heads of state are being played by four people attending an event organised by the university’s department of war studies. Several students who have taken an MA module entitled Designing Wargames for Education & Analysis are showing games they have created to a select crowd of wargaming professionals, members of the military and representatives of a few big corporations.
Wargaming is essentially the competitive simulation of conflict, usually on some sort of map board with a variety of playing pieces. Chess can be understood as a heavily abstracted version, but there are detailed, complex games based on everything from the unification of Japan (Sekigahara) to apocalyptic sci-fi combat (Warhammer 40,000). Wargames have also been used extensively by military forces for about 200 years in order to plan real-life campaigns and role-play possible outcomes. The UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) has a dedicated Defence Wargaming Centre near Portsmouth, while the US Marine Corps is currently building a Wargaming and Analysis Center at its base in Quantico, Virginia.
One of those attending is an expert from the MoD who assures me the Ukraine invasion has been heavily war-gamed by both Nato and Russian military planners. Indeed, a report published by the Royal United Services Institute in February claimed that Russian forces ran wargames preceding the invasion in order to plan an attack on Ukraine’s infrastructure using assets within the country.
The Ukraine game here today is called War and Change and was designed by Sacha Nacouzi, currently studying for an MA in international security. The main aim for the western countries is to get Russia out of Ukraine, but each country also has to secure its own interests in the region. Meanwhile the player representing Russia must seek to end sanctions, reopen trade routes and get back on the Swift financial system. The action is separated into a series of 10 five-minute rounds, in which players negotiate, swap asset cards and work out mini deals. It’s more like a fantasy role-playing game, especially as Nacouzi encourages players to mimic the personalities and policies of the leaders they are portraying.
When I take part, I get stuck with Donald Trump, who is voted back in to power early in the game. I decide this means I should seek to grab the most valuable Ukrainian territories back from Russia so that I can look like a tough guy, while also reopening US airspace to Russian craft and unfreezing the assets of oligarchs so I can suck up to my pal Putin.
“The game is designed to provide a holistic overview of issues considered in territorial negotiations,” says Nacouzi. “This includes the strategic placements of regions, borders, trade agreements, agrifood exports, economic sanctions, gas and oil.” Her hope is that players come away with a better understanding of the assets countries have at their disposal and the kinds of liabilities they face in complex negotiations.
On a table beside War and Change, another group is playing Guns N’ Money, a game about weapons procurement. Nearby there’s Shooting Daedalus, about the tactics of modern urban combat.
What is interesting about these games is that the students don’t come from the professional wargame sector, so they’re unencumbered by conventional thinking and design rules. “It’s precisely because the students don’t have a professional background that they have a way of thinking of questions or ideas that you wouldn’t otherwise see,” says the event’s organiser, David Banks, a wargaming lecturer and academic director of the Wargaming Network at King’s College London. “One of the designers of the game about urban warfare was an architect – he’s really interested in the use of space. The diversity of life experiences on this course really helps. They don’t fall back on things they’ve learned or played.”
The next game I play illustrates this pretty clearly. Called Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone, it’s a simulation of drone warfare involving two players, one taking part as a drone pilot, the other as their commanding officer. In each round a possible target is identified on the board, which represents a satellite image, and the CO gives the pilot the command to strike. The pilot needs to follow that order or play an action card to question the directive. Each square on the board has a number relating to how many civilians may be killed if an attack goes ahead. Some of the actions are “signature strikes”, where the drone spots someone who looks like, or is behaving like, a known enemy target but their identity is not confirmed. The outcome of each strike is decided by the roll of the dice and if things go wrong, the pilot could be responsible for civilian casualties. When this happens, the player loses moral points, and they need to draw cards that show photographs of their victims. Repeated failures lead to increasing mental health difficulties and eventually incapacitating depression.
It is uncommon for wargames to model psychological outcomes, and I ask the game’s lead designer, Edward McEvoy, if there has been interest from those attending. “Yes,” he says. “Some of the experts we’ve spoken to today think that games that explore the human aspects of war and conflict could give new perspectives that may change certain policies. Perhaps they’ll even lead to less conflict.”
Wargames aren’t employed only by the military. Corporations use them to explore business decisions; government policymakers use them to simulate major events, including pandemics; and they have a role in disaster relief. “The UNHCR has made efforts in various cities to help with the influx of Ukrainian refugees and provide relief to civic centres and to other spaces housing many people and aid workers,” says Lily Boland, co-designer of Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone. “Wargaming and/or simulating some of these crucial aspects of refugee aid work would certainly help organisations like the UN and local institutions to prepare for these scenarios in advance.”
What the situation in Ukraine has shown the world is that the outcomes of military action are becoming less predictable. Russia’s command and control strategy has been found wanting, while Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s innovative and playful use of social media has increased awareness and support for his country in a way that would have been tough to forecast. As Banks puts it, “I’m a huge believer in using historical case studies as much as possible, but a lot of the problems we’re facing in the 21st century are not ones that we have any ready guides for.”
As the world becomes ever more unpredictable and prone to disruptive global events, perhaps new strategies and solutions will be discovered in games like these."

They are doing the opposite;"Amid the horror, we Ukrainians have become kinder towards each other. We are planning ahead – and still determined to win
For the last three months, 600 people have slept in the Heroiv Pratsi metro station in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. The city lies just 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border and has been heavily shelled since the first day of the invasion. Last week, the mayor of Kharkiv urged the temporary residents of Heroiv Pratsi to return to their homes. I first visited Heroiv Pratsi in mid-March, and recently returned to the metro station a few days before the mayor’s announcement. I was amazed by how well-maintained people’s temporary sleeping areas had become since my previous visit. Bouquets of lilac and daffodils had been placed next to almost every mattress.
Nina Maksymivna, an 80-year-old woman who had been staying in Heroiv Pratsi on my last visit, was still sleeping by the stairs in the same place where I had met her in March. Aside from very brief forays outside, she had barely left the underground in two months. It’s still possible to hear sounds of distant explosions in the area. For her, they were too close to feel safe. The Ukrainian army pushed the Russians back from Kharkiv’s outskirts in early May, but local fighting continues.
At 3am during my night in Kharkiv city centre, I was awoken by a loud bang. Still, I’m told this was nothing compared to how the city felt weeks ago. In Saltivka, the most damaged neighbourhood of Kharkiv, which had been inaccessible for some time, all that remains are empty buildings and burnt-out blocks. Russian troops are still stationed less than a mile away. On my recent visit, I met residents returning to check whether any of their belongings had survived. Men and women were cleaning the streets, some obviously shocked to see what remained. A local shipping company was helping people to move fridges and TV sets. “Long live Saltivka,” one of their guys, who was loading a lorry, shouted to me as I passed.
Almost two million people were living in Kharkiv at the start of the war. There are still more than a million left, and many more are now returning. The Kyiv to Kharkiv express trains are now packed. For Ukrainians, the decision to return is rational, but only if two conditions are met: first, if your house survived the shelling, and your water and electricity supply are fixed. Second, if there’s still a chance of getting a job. After three months of war, people’s savings are depleted. Many working-age adults are returning home to Kharkiv, leaving family members and friends to look after kids and elderly relatives in safer towns. But it’s especially hard for families where relatives have joined the army.
Compared to Kharkiv, my native Kyiv feels strangely normal, despite the curfew, the not yet fully operational public transport, and the occasional air-raid siren. Yet the war still goes on. The major battles are being fought in Donbas, in the south of Ukraine. In the newly occupied area around the southern city of Kherson, people are being kidnapped and tortured. I covered the Russian invasion of Donbas and Crimea in 2014. My biggest fear now is that Ukrainians in Kyiv and the west of the country will get used to the distant battles unfolding hundreds of kilometres away, and ignore the war. Last time, the unresolved conflicts in Donbas and Crimea became a pretext for the Kremlin’s full-scale attack.
Yet, finding myself recently at a small party in Kyiv, I know this time it’s different: there is nobody in the country untouched by the war. At the party, I spoke to one of Ukraine’s most famous travel bloggers, who is now making stories not from exotic far-flung locations, but from liberated Ukrainian towns. He is originally from occupied Luhansk, in the east. Every one of us at the party had a friend who had been killed, lost a house, became a refugee or is fighting on the frontline.
As a conflict reporter I know that wars cause societies to disintegrate. But from what I’ve seen, Ukrainians, and in particular Kyiv residents (who were previously known for their briskness and focus on work), have become kinder and warmer. The discussions that prevail are about rebuilding the country for the better. Professionals who helped with the logistics during the first months of the military invasion are now figuring out how their skills might be useful in a new environment. My cousin, an architect, recently called to tell me how his university mates have been united in developing a plan for rebuilding the country’s demolished infrastructure.
I find it hardest to interact with foreign experts and analysts. One veteran reporter from the Balkans recently told me that the longer the war lasted, the less she could understand its goal. Perplexed, I responded that Ukrainians saw the goal even more clearly now than before: to defend cities from invasion while ensuring the fewest possible casualties and to liberate the occupied territories, where the atrocities have been greatest.
Despite the many positive surprises we have seen during the war – including the strength of the Ukrainian army, which has shown itself to be more efficient compared to Russia’s poorly organised troops – for Ukrainians, it is going on exactly as we imagined. We knew that if we were attacked, it would last a long time. I’ve head many times that Ukrainians should manage their expectations, and that “compassion fatigue” is inevitable from the west. But Ukrainians aren’t asking for compassion: we’re asking for solidarity. We’re fighters, not powerless victims.
Yes – Ukrainians are adjusting to the war, and trying to make daily life more bearable, as the people who put flowers near their beds in the Kharkiv metro attest. But this doesn’t mean we have to normalise the conflict. Discussions about rebuilding the country and victory come not from naivety: they are rooted in the knowledge that we can’t afford to waste energy and time explaining why things are impossible. We need to preserve our strength to prove the opposite is true.
In Kyiv, I recently passed by a bookstore that was still open. It sold funny socks with infamous phrases such as “Russian ship, go fuck yourself”. On the label of one pair was written: “Made of 92% cotton, 8% Lycra, and 100% trust in Ukraine”.

An increasingly bitter diplomatic row over Germany’s unwillingness to supply heavy weaponry to Ukraine threatened to spill into a wider dispute between allies over whether they are prepared to accept a peace settlement that leaves Vladimir Putin capable of claiming victory.
One western official said western leaders are divided between those who think they can work with Vladimir Putin’s Russia once the war is over, and those who think they cannot.
The row is leading to disputes over the arming of Ukraine, the feasibility of enforcing a Russian oil import embargo and whether Kyiv will have to accept a further loss of territory at the end of the war as the price for peace.
The immediate point of conflict between Ukraine and some of its allies focusses on the supply of weaponry to Ukraine, and the heavy weather Germany seems to be making in setting up an elaborate chain that would see the country supplying armaments to its Eastern neighbours – principally Poland and the Czech Republic – that would in turn send armoury on to Ukraine.
Kyiv is suffering serious losses due to the absence of long-range weaponry. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the delivery of weapons could not be delayed: “We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to hit the enemy from a long distance.”
Citing its sources in Nato, the national news agency, Deutsche Presse Agentur, reported that alliance members have informally agreed not to supply certain weaponry to Ukraine, fearing Russia could see the delivery of tanks and combat aircraft as the west entering the war and take retaliatory measures. Quite what this decision means in practical terms is disputed.
There were also US-sourced reports that Israel had rejected a US request to allow Germany to send Spike anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Spike missiles are produced in Germany with Israeli technology under an Israeli licence. Since the beginning of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Israel has taken a neutral stance and refused to supply weapons to Ukraine.
The disputes come as some influential US voices, from veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger to the New York Times, have urged Ukraine to realise it may have to lose territory to Putin.
In a reference to the tensions, the UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, a staunch war hawk, warned the West against backsliding and appeasement, insisting the need to supply arms was urgent in a speech in Sarajevo: “What we cannot have is any lifting of sanctions, any appeasement, which will simply make Putin stronger in the longer term.” She insists private sanctions on Russia cannot be lifted until Putin has completely left Ukraine, and his army is irreversibly weakened. She has strong allies in eastern Europe, and the Baltics, but not in Paris or Berlin.
Truss has argued that any backsliding would result in a more prolonged and painful conflict.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, adopted an ironic, almost uncomprehending tone at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week about the slowness of arms deliveries: “We are pursuing this with strategic patience. I don’t understand why this is so difficult.” The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sensed German reticence stemmed from a desire to rebuild relations with Putin once the war ends. “No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: ‘Let’s take his interests into account’,” said Zelenskiy.
Poland has also heavily criticised Germany’s slowness, and within Germany the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has come under attack for appearing not to want either side to emerge victorious from the war, a stance Scholz denies.
Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag Defense Committee and a member of the Free Democrat party, said: “It must not be that at the end of the war the world sees Germany as a complete brakeman and loser just because we are unable to organise and communicate.”
Early in the conflict Germany proposed quickly supplying Ukraine with heavy weaponry in a “ring system” – whereby eastern European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic would provide Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, with these being replenished by modern German Leopard tanks. Whether the failure to achieve this yet is due to bureaucratic inertia, cynical procrastination or a reflection of the depleted state of the German armed forces is hard to unravel. If you are on the frontline, it probably matters little.
In a speech in Davos, Scholz tried to dismiss claims that he did not understand the scale of the issues at stake. He said the 24 February invasion had come like a thunderclap.
He described Putin’s war as “imperialism” that is “trying to bomb us back to a time when war was a common tool. It is not only the statehood of Ukraine at stake but a world order that binds might to law”. He claimed Putin had already missed all of his strategic goals. “A capture of all of Ukraine by Russia seems further away today than it was at the beginning of the war. More than ever, Ukraine is emphasising its European future.”
He added that “our goal is clear. Putin must not win this war”. His remarks, insisting there can be no peace dictated by Putin, contrast with those of Boris Johnson, who has always insisted Putin must lose the war and be seen to lose the war.
Truss was one of the first European figures to echo Ukrainian claims that it cannot lose territory in the war, but must regain land lost to Russian separatists since 2014. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, in Kyiv this week said: “Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future. No decisions can be taken about its future without it.” Although there are different voices within the Ukrainian diplomatic landscape, Zelenskiy’s public position appears to be broadly the same. He told a meeting at Davos that he joined by video link: “When Ukraine says it is fighting to regain its territories, it means that Ukraine will fight until it restores all of its territory. It doesn’t mean anything else. It’s about our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our independence.”
He added: “This state of ‘hot’ hostilities, of bloody war, can only move into diplomatic negotiations with the authentic participation of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, supported by our strategic partners, when we see that the Russian Federation shows real willingness and desire to move from bloody war to diplomacy. This will be possible only when Russia concedes at least something, such as pulling back troops to the borders as they were on February 24.”
At present there does not seem to be any likelihood of Russia signalling such a retreat. Quite the opposite.
But that does not mean countries are not coming forward to offer their mediation services. Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, for instance, has assembled a complex four-point plan that was formally presented to the UN secretary general, António Guterres.
The first step in the plan would involve a supervised ceasefire and “demilitarisation” of the frontline. This would be a multilateral negotiation at a conference on the future status of Ukraine, resuscitating the proposal of future Ukrainian neutrality backed by security guarantees provided by major powers. This could give a security umbrella to Ukraine before the end of the peace process, and act as a substitute for Ukraine’s one-time aspiration to Nato membership.
The next stage would be a bilateral treaty between Ukraine and Russia on “border issues”. The language of the proposal points to free movement of people and economic life, de facto autonomy for the occupied territories and a single economic zone, as well as civil guarantees for Russian minorities, including over language. This would be very close to the Minsk agreement, a format that France and Germany oversaw and the Ukrainians never liked.
The final stage would be a grand bargain on EU/Nato-Russia relations, revival of strategic stability talks, a new role for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and a revisiting of some of the other issues that were being discussed between the US and Russia last summer.
Russia seemed to take great pleasure in ridiculing both the plan and its proponent. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev blasted Draghi’s proposals: “It seems that it was prepared not by diplomats, but by local political scientists who have read provincial newspapers and operate only with Ukrainian fakes.” Yet other voices in Russia think there are aspects of the plan that could be adopted later, when both sides have fought themselves to a standstill."

Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages.
Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least nine people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city.
“There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks.
The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure.
The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre.
“For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said.
The booms of incoming and outgoing artillery fire were audible throughout Thursday, shaking buildings and setting off car alarms in central Kharkiv.
In the afternoon, a deep shell crater was left on Otakara Yarosha Street in front of a block of flats from which the windows on all five floors had been blown out. Police at the scene said they did not know how many people had died there.
Outside the 23 August metro station, a blast had brought down large branches from several trees, and dead pigeons and tangled electricity cables lay scattered across a wide expanse of concrete. Shrapnel had torn holes in a nearby second world war monument.
It was not immediately obvious whether people had died at the scene, and there were few people around to ask, as air raid sirens and the booms of artillery sounded.
A steady flow of residents had started to return to their homes in the city. A few cafes and restaurants had opened, people were strolling in city parks on Thursday morning and this week, and the metro began operating again for the first time since the invasion. In recent weeks, its main use has been as a bomb shelter, with thousands living on its underground platforms.
The city mayor, Ihor Terekhov, told residents: “We will not stop the metro, but we will allocate special sectors where you can stay and shelter from bombing.”
After Russia failed in its assaults on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the early days of the war, Moscow has concentrated much of its efforts on a bloody offensive to take more territory in the Donbas region. But Thursday’s attacks raised fears that Kharkiv could still be on the agenda.
“The Russian troops are engaged in a counter-offensive, and are trying to reoccupy territories that were liberated by our troops just a month ago,” said Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region’s chief prosecutor, in an interview with the Guardian. He said he believed the ultimate aim was to launch a renewed assault on the city itself.
Filchakov also noted reports that Russian troops were unloading Iskander missiles at the railway station in Belgorod, just across the border.
For now, said Synehubov, a renewed ground assault on the city was not possible. “They are firing from the positions they have held for a long time; they are constantly trying to counterattack but our forces are holding their positions.”
He said there was not a significant enough buildup of new troops and equipment on the other side of the border to signal the capacity for a new assault on the city. “But that’s right now, and the situation can change at any minute,” he added.
However, Synehubov said, the main problem for the Kharkiv region, unlike others, was that the Russians continued to shell settlements after they had retreated.
“In Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv regions, the Russians fought for a certain period, realised they had hit a wall and then took the decision to retreat, and they retreated fully from these territories,” he said.
“Here, even if we liberate a place, then the enemy stays in its positions and keeps hitting it, and we can’t properly evacuate people, we can’t bring humanitarian aid, because these places are under permanent fire. We can’t bring in de-mining teams because of the shelling, so we need to push the enemy back even further so they would focus on our positions and not on population centres,” he said."

A British man who has turned his Polish castle into a makeshift hotel for Ukrainian refugees has accused the UK government of showing “no humanity whatsoever” for not allowing a severely autistic teenager to come to live with an approved foster carer in Lancashire.
Pleas are mounting for compassion to be shown to Timothy Tymoshenko, 16, who fled the war in Ukraine without his parents. He is living with his 17-year-old brother, Yurii, in what was once a private palace for the prince-bishop of Wrocław in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border.
Jim Parton, a former stockbroker and writer from London, lives there with his Polish wife, Anna, and their six children, aged seven to 17.
When the Russian invasion began in February, they decided to turn what is usually a guest house and wedding venue into an open house for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary abroad.
They are currently hosting 17 people in the sprawling 700-year-old palace, after four left for Canada on Monday. Among those remaining is Timothy, who is severely autistic, non-verbal and needs strong prescription medication to control his changing moods.
Experienced children’s carers in Lancashire have been to visit the boys in Poland and are willing to take brothers in, but are growing increasingly frustrated that the UK government hasn’t yet granted them visas to enter the country.
Julie Elliot, 61, and her husband, Roger, 66, already have 14 children together – four biological and 10 adopted. Both worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers to their adopted family, and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children.
Their adopted children, aged between nine and 40, all have disabilities and eight of them still live at the couple’s home in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire.
They and Parton are pleading with the Home Office to let Timothy come to the UK along with his brother. They do not qualify for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as unaccompanied children under 18.
The issue is the subject of a high court challenge and dozens of UK foster carers are anxiously waiting to see if approval is granted for the children they hope to care for to be brought to the UK.
Parton is growing increasingly frustrated with the visa situation. “It’s an absolute disgrace that it is taking so long. There’s no humanity whatsoever from the government in recognising that this is a special case,” he said.
“What makes me most cross is the safeguarding reason for delaying visas for these children,” said Julie Elliot, who recently travelled to Poland to meet Timothy and Yurii and help look after Timothy for a week.
On arrival, she found him to be hungry, unwashed and dehydrated. “Tim needs someone to care for him to ensure he eats and drinks regularly,” she said.
The boys’ mother, Anna, sent the two brothers across the border because Timothy was not coping with the interruption to his routine by having to hurry into underground bomb shelters and was getting very distressed at the sound of the constant warning sirens.
“Tim is in a very unsafe situation,” said Elliot. “We have been through 10 adoption assessments and they are the most frightening thing on God’s earth but they don’t compare with this process of trying to get a visa for Tim. There doesn’t seem to be a system in place. I was told we should hear something about the legal case in 14 days but that is a long time when you’re a child and nobody’s looking after you … All I’m asking for these children like Tim who are waiting to be fostered is just give them a visa, they’re not going to be any trouble to anyone.”
Anna is also frustrated about the delays in granting the visas: “When the generous people of Britain extended a helping hand to my family we cannot grab it because the documents will not be issued. As a mother I am under a lot of stress and want to breathe a sigh of relief that my children are not under shelling and are under supervision of responsible and kind people,” she said.
A government spokesperson said: “It is tragic that children have been caught up in Putin’s war. The safety and wellbeing of children is paramount and it is vital we have robust safeguarding processes. For this reason, only under-18s who are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK are currently eligible for Homes for Ukraine. We keep eligibility for all schemes under review.”"

Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east, as Ukrainian forces fell back from some of their positions in the Donbas region.
Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken by Russian forces, Ukraine’s general staff reported that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.
The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas.
“It is clear that our boys are slowly retreating to more fortified positions – we need to hold back this horde,” Haidai said. Hinting at further withdrawals, he said it was possible that troops would leave “one settlement, maybe two. We need to win the war, not the battle.”
Separately, a senior Ukrainian military official conceded at a briefing on Thursday that Russia had the upper hand in fighting in Luhansk. “Russia has the advantage, but we are doing everything we can,” Gen Oleksiy Gromov said.
Haidai said police in Lysychansk were burying the bodies of civilians in mass graves, with about 150 people having been buried in such a grave in one district.
If confirmed, Russia’s continuing advances in Lyman, which has been contested for a month, would make it easier for Russian forces to isolate the key city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under relentless shelling for days.
According to accounts posted on social media, Lyman’s Ukrainian defenders had pulled back to the southern outskirts, although fighting was continuing, in particular around the railway sidings in the city.
Outside Sievierodonetsk, now the focal point of Moscow’s renewed offensive in Donbas, Haidai said fighting was “very difficult”.
Predicting the “coming week will be decisive”, Haidai said the city was being subjected to a “colossal amount of shelling” by Russian troops attempting to batter it into submission.
After failing to seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or its second city, Kharkiv, in its three-month war, Russia is trying to take full control of Donbas, comprising two eastern provinces that Russia claims on behalf of separatists.
Moscow has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.
Their fall would leave the whole of Luhansk province under Russian control, a main aim of the Kremlin’s war.
Meanwhile the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, issued a bitter rebuke to the west for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war.
Calling for help “without limits”, specifically shipments of heavy weaponry, he also criticised recent suggestions that a negotiated peace deal could include territorial concessions.
Zelenskiy has said Russian troops heavily outnumber Ukrainian forces in some parts of the east, and Kyiv has been trying unsuccessfully to arrange a prisoner swap with Moscow.
The heavy attrition on Ukrainian defenders in the east – where between 50 and 100 soldiers are dying every day, according to Zelenskiy – has also led to claims by Russia of large numbers of prisoners being taken.
Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russia-backed self-proclaimed people’s republics of Luhansk and Donetsk number about 8,000, the Luhansk official, Rodion Miroshnik, was quoted by Tass news agency as saying.
“There are a lot of prisoners,” Miroshnik said. “Now the total number is somewhere in the region of 8,000. That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day.” His claims could not be verified.
As Russia seeks to solidify its grip on the territory it has seized, Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process for residents of newly captured districts to acquire Russian citizenship and passports.
The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops.
In a late-night video address, Zelenskiy said of the changes to the Russian enlistment rules: “[They] no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight. It will still take time to crush this will.”
Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the World Economic Forum in Davos his country “badly” needed multiple-launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower in the battle for Donbas.
In the eastern town of Soledar, Ukraine’s salt manufacturing hub, the ground shook moments after Natalia Timofeyenko climbed out of her bunker on Wednesday.
“I go outside just to see people. I know that there is shelling out there but I go,” the 47-year-old said after a blast smashed apart a chunk of a salt mine where she worked with most of her friends and neighbours.

Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine.
Videos published by the Russian ministry of emergency situations showed the vans, which it called “mobile information complexes”, playing state TV news segments and political chat shows where pundits support the invasion to locals in the ruined city that still lacks electricity and running water.
The Orwellian turn comes as much of Mariupol was destroyed in an artillery bombardment that left thousands dead. One of the vans was deployed near the ruins of the Mariupol drama theatre, where hundreds were killed in an airstrike in March.
Several of the trucks now patrol the city, mainly playing Russian television news segments. “The people of Mariupol have been held in a virtual informational vacuum for three months due to the lack of electricity,” wrote the emergencies ministry in a statement.
The mobile screens have reportedly been deployed to places where Mariupol residents are receiving humanitarian aid, Russian documents, and at points in the city where drinking water is available.
“The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”.
“The truth and the propaganda,” wrote Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, posting a video of the trucks superimposed over images of the ruins of the city. This is “the Russian world”, he added.
The effort to install Russian propaganda in the ruined city is part of a larger effort at pacifying and integrating captured cities like Mariupol despite earlier assurances by Vladimir Putin that Russia did not seek to occupy new territory in Ukraine.
Putin on Wednesday signed a law that would fast-track applications for citizenship from Mariupol, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are partly under government control.
The Kremlin decision has been decried as “passportisation”, an attempt to annex the territories by filling them with de facto Russian citizens.
Senior Kremlin officials have already promised to remain in southern Ukraine “for ever”.
“The simplified system will allow all of us to clearly see that Russia is here not just for a long time but for ever,” the Moscow-appointed deputy leader of the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency.
“The illegal issuing of passports … is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Russian-controlled administration in Kherson also announced that it would begin issuing salaries in roubles on Thursday, effectively adopting Russia’s currency as part of the creeping annexation of southern Ukrainian territories.
Local authorities installed by Russia have also said they may formally request annexation."

The UK government introduced legislation on Thursday to help councils, NHS trusts and other public bodies exit contracts with Gazprom and other Russian companies
Councils have been keen to withdraw from contracts amid concerns they were helping to fund Vladimir Putin’s regime. They had been prohibited from taking “non-commercial considerations” into account when procuring or terminating contracts, and they have a statutory duty to find the cheapest deal on behalf of the taxpayer.
Many councils had been forced to select Gazprom as a supplier because it offered the greatest value for money. They paid £29m to Gazprom from 2016 to 2021, data firm Tussell has said.
In March, the Cabinet Office asked central government to review all contracts with Russia and Belarus-linked firms and to consider terminating those contracts. This process has now been extended to local councils.
Councils including Merton and Telford and Wrekin have said they are keen to cut ties with Russia.
A government source said: “Local authorities are not obliged to terminate contracts, but our message is clear: Putin’s barbaric regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.”
The communities secretary, Michael Gove, will now write to all councils to make them aware of the changes.
The government has said any costs incurred from exiting contracts will have to be covered by existing budgets.
The west is attempting to choke off the Russian economy to damage Putin’s war coffers and fuel anti-war sentiment among the Russian public.
A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Businesses with links to Putin’s murderous regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.
“These measures will allow councils to terminate existing contracts – ensuring public money does not fund these organisations or Putin’s barbaric war machine.”
Research for the Guardian and Tussell shows that councils and NHS trusts have paid nearly £5m to Russian firms including Gazprom since the invasion of Ukraine under existing contracts.
NHS trusts – including Manchester University NHS foundation trust and the Southport & Ormskirk hospital NHS trust – have paid £3.2m. Councils including Portsmouth and Buckinghamshire have paid £1.6m.
Separately, a Treasury deadline to halt payments to Gazprombank and its subsidiaries for gas going from the UK to European Union countries is fast approaching. An original deadline of 21 April to halt payments was extended to 31 May last month. Many large Gazprom gas contract holders are based in the UK and help supply gas to the EU, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia.
Gazprom’s UK arm is the largest non-UK supplier of gas to businesses and public bodies. Its market share was 22% before the invasion of Ukraine and it supplied gas to 178,000 sites, with contracts worth approximately £4bn, according to Capital Monitor estimates."

On the final day of March, soldiers of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic entered the basement in Mariupol where Svitlana and Vitaly were sheltering.
“You have 15 minutes to get ready and then you’re leaving,” shouted one, waving an automatic rifle.
It was, according to the Russian narrative of its Ukraine invasion, the day that Svitlana and Vitaly were liberated. But it did not feel much like that to them.
Instead, it was merely the end of one ordeal and the start of another: a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia.
The siege, destruction and ultimate Russian conquest of Mariupol have been well-documented, but Svitlana and Vitaly’s experiences provide a particularly vivid illustration of the unexpected terror that was visited on this city of half a million people over the past months.
Until late February, the couple lived in a compact but cosy one-room apartment on the eastern side of Mariupol, with Svitlana’s two children from a previous marriage. She worked in a school, he had a factory job. She was three months pregnant and the couple were looking forward to their first child together.
Over the next two months, they lost almost everything.
They had not paid much attention to the warnings that Russia could launch a new war in Ukraine, but they could see and hear the first incoming fire on 24 February from their windows.
It soon became clear that it was too dangerous to stay sleeping in the apartment, but their block’s cellar was not fit for habitation, so instead most residents moved to the stairwell, laying out makeshift mattresses on the hard concrete floors.
Gradually, they settled into a routine. In the first days, there were lulls in the shelling and they could scurry outside to buy food. They bought two chickens from an acquaintance with a garden; with someone else, they swapped a bottle of vodka for some potatoes.
They cooked over open fire in the courtyard, though at times even that seemed too dangerous, as the artillery shells flew in with increasing frequency. Once every two days, Vitaly would risk his life to venture out to a well and bring water for the family. Some days, he took Svitlana’s 13-year-old son with him, so they could carry more water back. In the night, it was sometimes so cold in the stairwell that the bottles of water turned to ice.
One day, when Vitaly began to lower the bucket into the well, he saw there were dead bodies floating far down below. He assumed they had jumped in to take cover during unexpected shelling, but had then fallen and drowned. He set off to find another well, with clean water.
On one water run, a shell landed so close to Vitaly that he was thrown to the ground by the blast. “He came back home with these crazy eyes, he was making no sense, I thought I’d lost him forever,” said Svitlana. The next day, his cognitive function was better, but he lost hearing in his right ear for the next two months.
How many people in their building were killed? Vitaly counted, slowly: “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight people we knew personally, just from our section of the block. And in the neighbouring block it was much, much worse,” he said.
From the blown-out windows of the upper floors of their building, they could see plumes of smoke rising across Mariupol. Svitlana wondered about her parents on the other side of town. She had no idea if they were still alive, and no way of finding out. There was no electricity and no phone reception.
On days when there were deaths, a group of men from the block buried the bodies in the courtyard, working as quickly as possible to minimise the time spent outside. It was the old people who died first.
“I knew those old women all my life. They sat outside the apartment block on the benches, chatting away, passing the time. And then you have to close the eyes of those women and bury them in their own courtyard,” said Vitaly.
Five times, Grad missiles hit their apartment block, as Russian forces haphazardly attempted to target detachments of Ukrainian forces that had based themselves nearby. Vitaly and Svitlana’s flat caught fire after one of the strikes. By the time the flames died down, everything had been destroyed; even the wall between the kitchen and the living room had been incinerated.
The cold nights, the lack of food and the constant bombardment were hard to stand. Svitlana’s daughter had bouts of hysteria and screaming. An old man on one floor kept asking the same question: “When will it end?” On another floor, a woman refused food. It would be better to end things sooner, she said quietly.
On 17 March, after another rocket attack, Svitlana lost her pregnancy. She was bleeding heavily and feverish, but there was no chance to receive proper medical care. On the third day, one of the neighbours managed to find an ampoule of Oxytocin; Svitlana injected it herself and blood started flowing more freely.
“I’m not 15, I know how these things work,” she said, when asked how she knew how to inject the medicine. It may have saved her life.
After the miscarriage, the neighbours rallied around Svitlana with the few provisions they had left. Someone rustled up some vitamin pills. Someone else found a miraculously uneaten piece of cheese. She continued to bleed periodically, but felt as if she might survive.
One morning, a part of the apartment block was hit by an airstrike, causing the entire building to shake and debris to fall from the ceiling and walls. As they regained composure, they could hear wailing from the ninth floor, where a woman had remained, living with her 11-year-old son throughout the bombardment.
Vitaly rushed upstairs. He could see the boy’s arms and legs sticking out from under a pile of bricks and debris. He worked him free. The boy was shocked, but unhurt. His mother was dead.
They were not able to bury her in the courtyard like the others; she had not been a slim woman, and it was too much to carry her down from the ninth floor. So they left her under the rubble.
Afterwards, the boy displayed few emotions. He did not cry. He politely said thank you when someone gave him food, or a hug. But then, in the nights, he would let out terrible piercing screams amid his fitful bursts of sleep.
Soon after the airstrike, the family moved to the basement of a neighbouring house, where another group of people were already sheltering. They took the boy with them.
After a week living in the cellar, with only the briefest forays above ground during which the shelling seemed to have intensified further, the Russia-backed forces arrived on 31 March and ordered everyone out of the cellar.
When the group emerged above ground, they were ordered to walk for half an hour, carrying their possessions with them and with shells flying overhead, to a spot where they joined others from the district. Women and children were crammed into buses while the men continued on foot.
In the village of Sartana, Vitaly and some other men were put into the back of a truck that reeked of corpses. Nobody explained anything about where they were going or what would happen next.
Svitlana and Vitaly were reunited in the town of Novoazovsk, part of the Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic, where they were housed in a school, 20 people to a classroom. There was nothing to sleep on, but they were given hot food. Soldiers confiscated their phones.
They left the boy whose mother had died in Novoazovsk; his estranged Russian father would come to pick him up, they hoped. His father would take him to live in Russia, the country whose assault had killed his mother.
After some days, Svitlana, Vitaly and the two children were again loaded on to buses, and driven to the town of Dokuchayevsk, where they joined hundreds of people waiting in the local Soviet-era House of Culture to undergo what the Russians have termed a “filtration” procedure.
Svitlana was allowed into the mothers and children room; Vitaly was held in the main hall, where hundreds of men tried to grab a few hours sleep slumped on chairs. The smell was disgusting.
The mothers and children room was hardly any better. Many of the children had diarrhoea or dysentery; Svitlana’s daughter was vomiting frequently. She herself still felt weak. There was almost no food: breakfast was tea, lunch was hot water and a biscuit.
After two days, it was Vitaly’s turn for filtration. He was taken to the police station, where he was ordered to undress fully and examined for tattoos that might give away a Ukrainian nationalist affiliation. Then he was questioned, photographed and fingerprinted. The process took five hours. After that, the family were put on a bus to the border with Russia. They crossed after another round of questioning, and spent the night at a camp on the other side, from where the next morning yet another bus drove them to the train station in the city of Taganrog.
In the filtration camps, Mariupol residents had been told they would be given resources to start a new life anywhere they wanted in the Russian Federation. But when they arrived at the station in Taganrog, there was one train, departing to Saransk, a dusty city 300 miles east of Moscow.
For those who did not have their own travel plans, Saransk was the only option. Exhausted, weary and unwashed, they boarded the train to an uncertain new life.
Svitlana had found a better option. She had managed to contact a friend who had an acquaintance in Taganrog, who agreed to put the family up for three days. For the first time in two months, Svitlana and Vitaly slept in real beds and had hot showers.
They told their host in Taganrog a little about what they had been through, and the woman was incredulous. But they did not go into detail.
“We didn’t want to say too much about what we had seen while we were still in Russia; we didn’t want to attract attention, we wanted to be able to leave,” said Svitlana.
She was still regularly bleeding from the miscarriage. Some of her skin had attained a blueish hue, and her legs were swollen “like a bear”, she said. On occasion, she fainted. But she did not seek medical treatment. Spending time inside Russia after the weeks of misery they had been through felt like further abuse, and she wanted to get out as soon as possible.
From Taganrog, the family took a train to Moscow, then to St Petersburg. From there, they crossed to Estonia without problems, and made their way onwards to a western European country, where they are now trying to make a new home.
Soon after their arrival, doctors performed an operation on Svitlana that she should have had weeks earlier. Slowly, her life is getting back to normal. The children have calmed down a little. The aches and pains have dissipated and the swelling in her legs has subsided. She no longer jumps in fear every time someone opens or closes a door, and she can recount the awful ordeal she went through with clarity and poise.
But the nights are harder than the days. Almost every night, Svitlana has visions of incoming artillery and missiles. She wakes up breathless and terrified.
Many of the couple’s friends have simply disappeared. Are they still in Mariupol? Trying to start a new life after being dumped somewhere in a far-flung corner of Russia? Dead? They have no idea.
Svitlana does know that her parents survived the siege of Mariupol. She has not spoken to them since the beginning of the war, and they do not currently have working phones. But twice, they called Svitlana’s sister from a borrowed phone, to give notice they were still alive.
Svitlana has no more information than that; she does not know what horrors they went through in their part of the city, though she can guess it was not easy. It was not easy for anyone in Mariupol.
Svitlana and Vitaly are pseudonyms. They asked not to use their real names, or give their address in Mariupol, because they fear for Svitlana’s parents. She hopes that soon, they too will be able to leave for Europe; she knows her father would not want to live under Russian rule, she said. The fate of her parents is a constant worry that prevents her focusing fully on starting a new life in Europe.
One thing Vitaly and Svitlana are both certain of is that they will never go back.
“Return to what?” asked Vitaly, bitterly. “There’s nothing there. Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.”"

Russia’s offensive in the Donbas region is making slow progress. Having rushed to launch the operation to avoid giving Ukraine time to bring up new weapons from the west, Russia has found that its depleted and exhausted units are unwilling and unable to assault Ukrainian positions without incurring unacceptable losses. The Russian army has, therefore, fallen back on the mass application of artillery, destroying village after village, which they occupy after Ukrainian units withdraw.
For the Ukrainian military, the current Russian tactics may be unsophisticated and nihilistic, but they are also dangerous. To stop the Russians from advancing, the Ukrainian armed forces must occupy the ground. This subjects their units to heavy bombardment, and is producing a steady accumulation of Ukrainian casualties. The Ukrainians are trying to limit the weight of Russian fire by raiding and striking the logistics supporting the Russian artillery.
The challenge for the Russian military is maintaining troop levels. Moscow has begun an unannounced mobilisation of citizens with former military service, complementing a recruitment drive for volunteers to take up short-term service contracts. The short-term contracts are intended to keep up the strength of units until mobilised personnel are organised and equipped. But with little training, low morale, poor unit cohesion following significant casualties and a steady influx of new personnel, Russian units continue to perform badly and suffer disproportionately in engagements.
Although the short-term military trends currently favour Ukraine, the country faces hard choices. So long as Russia has a significant number of artillery systems and its air defences deny Ukraine air support, the Ukrainian military is forced to remain dispersed, limiting its available combat power at any one point and slowing the rate at which it can liberate territory. Ukraine must also guard against the risk that Russia moves into a large and more overt mobilisation of its population that, while politically risky, would threaten a significant offensive late in the year, requiring Ukraine to hold forces in reserve.
If the Ukrainian military cannot liberate significant tracts of territory or bleed out the Russian army this summer then there is the risk of a protracted conflict. The principal security concerns for Kyiv are economic and political. Without a peace settlement, Ukraine will remain economically paralysed, its ports blockaded, its cities heavily damaged, and investment or reconstruction deterred by the ever looming prospect of missile strikes. Kyiv is expected to lose almost half of its GDP this year. Many internally displaced Ukrainians have been living off their savings. These will begin to run out.
A protracted conflict also risks damaging internal cohesion. Ukraine has so far been politically unified, with Russia’s sympathisers in the Ukrainian state keeping a low profile or enthusiastically supporting the war effort. It would be dangerous to do anything else. As curfews and movement controls are lifted, however, and the political clarity of the need to defend Kyiv dissipates, there are renewed opportunities for subversion. How the government ensures it can provide heating for citizens away from the front as winter approaches, for example, is an issue over which criticism may be justified. But such issues can also be weaponised by Russia to degrade the country’s internal unity.
In a protracted conflict, Ukraine will probably depend upon financial assistance from abroad, but it is also likely to need that assistance precisely when its international partners are under the greatest economic strain. Inflation in the UK is approaching 10%. There is a serious risk of recession. If job losses come in the autumn, it will coincide with people’s renewed need to heat their homes. Energy prices, meanwhile, are expected to remain high, and Russia has so far kept supplying Europe. Under these conditions European citizens may become less supportive of aiding Ukraine to fight a grinding war in Donbas when there is acute pain felt at home.
Given these dark clouds on the horizon, Ukraine’s partners must pursue two courses of action. First, Ukraine must improve its security position as much as possible over the summer. To do this it requires long-range artillery that can challenge Russia’s fires dominance. The US provision of M777 155mm howitzers is a good start. Ukraine’s partners must also help in training new Ukrainian brigades so that the country can withdraw and reconstitute some of its units. It is also critical that the Russian army not be given the opportunity to recover the initiative. To prevent this, it is important to keep the rate of Russian casualties in Donbas high, so that mobilised personnel have to be immediately pushed into maintaining Russian positions rather than organised into new units able to open up new axes.
The second line of effort must be a coordinated approach across Europe to build resilience for this winter and to begin working out the best means of offering economic support to Ukraine. There is also a need to inform the public early and clearly as to the direct correlation between Russia’s actions and the economic pain to come. Russian disinformation will inevitably portray the economic pain as a consequence of supporting Kyiv. Such distortions need to be preemptively undermined.
Finally, there is the question of alliance unity. There are growing calls across Nato to consider negotiated solutions, often premised on trading Ukrainian territory for peace. While negotiations should never be abandoned, pushing for a ceasefire that would lock in Russian gains, allow the Russian army to recover and prepare for a renewed offensive and leave Ukraine economically crippled, is deeply naive. It is vital that the disagreements about objectives between key European partners are thrashed out and resolved as soon as possible. As Ukrainian citizens are put through filtration camps, and Russia plots the annexation of more of its territory, it must be understood that peace on Russia’s terms would be a very violent affair.

In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight.
It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.”
He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine.
“His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grassroots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.”
The activist left is relatively small in Ukraine, where the memory of Soviet communism lingers, and its anarchist component is even smaller. But from 1917-21 Ukraine was home to one of the world’s most famous anarchist movements, which sprung out of the power vacuum created by the fall of Tsarist Russia.
Led by the anarchist Nestor Makhno, the movement argued for the rights of Ukraine’s peasantry and quickly grew in popularity under the slogans “Death to those who stand in the way of free working people” and “Power breeds parasites, long live anarchy!”
At the height of the movement, self-governing communes existed across most of southern and eastern Ukraine under the protection of Makhno’s army. His base was in Huliaipole, a town in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, which has been frequently fought over since February. The Bolsheviks defeated Makhno’s army and he died in exile in Paris.
Those at the Kyiv anarchists’ headquarters admit that these are no longer “Makhno times”. Today, the anarchist movement in Ukraine is small and a battalion acting independently would collapse on a modern-day battlefield, they say.
About 100 anarchists have signed up to fight in Ukraine’s army and territorial defence forces, according to Serhiy Movchan, the group’s spokesperson. In addition, about 20 foreign anarchists have signed up, including a Russian who fled his country three years ago. Others have come to Ukraine to work as volunteer paramedics.
“We have a strict screening process,” said Dmytro, who was eager to stress that the foreign volunteers differ from some of the others who have arrived in the country since February. “We don’t want people who just come here to kill; we want them to understand what they are fighting for.”
Before the 24 February invasion, the anarchists – small in number – would join forces with wider leftwing activist networks. But attracting supporters faced obstacles due to the country’s experience of the Soviet era.
In the name of socialism, mass murders were carried out, a man-made famine was created, and swathes of culture and history, including the Ukrainian language, were repressed. A controversial set of de-Communisation laws were passed in 2015 to deal with this legacy, but many on the left feel the wider population began to associate everything on the left with the Soviet Union.
Then, under Putin’s Russia Kremlin spin doctors and their allies co-opted leftist rhetoric to create pro-Russian political parties across the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine. These parties were used to appeal to those voters who harboured nostalgia for communist times.
Leaked emails in 2016 revealed how the Kharkiv regional leader of the Communist party of Ukraine, banned the previous year for promoting separatism, had received emails from the office of the former Kremlin spin doctor Vladislav Surkov on how to foment separatism and campaign for federalisation. (Since 2014 the Kremlin has been pushing for federalisation in Ukraine as Russia’s way of re-gaining leverage in national politics.)
Dmytro also pointed to the “leftwing” messaging used by the Kremlin when creating the self-declared people’s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Russian-backed unrecognised states in eastern Ukraine. He said that the irony is that the entities have been headed by ultra-rightists such as Igor Girkin, who promoted Russian nationalism, carried out extrajudicial killings, and banned freedom of speech and association.
The recent full-scale invasion by Russia has brought another layer of mud for activists on Ukraine’s left, said Movchan.
“Putin has appropriated the word anti-fascist and he exploits it to justify his war,” said Movhcan. “[Ukrainian] nationalists say if you’re anti-fascist, you’re pro-Russian, but that’s not the case.”
Movchan said far-right nationalism has always failed to gain popular support in Ukraine, but moderate nationalism – which emphasises religion, language and the army – became mainstream after 2014.
Many Ukrainian politicians assumed nationalist messaging in an ensuing competition to present themselves as Ukrainian patriots. This nationalism promotes conservative, non-progressive ideas and therefore presents a “big problem”, said Movchan.
“I think both sides of the elite did a lot to create a situation whereby Ukrainians argue a lot about language and versions of history instead of how Kryvyi Rih Stal was privatised,” said Movchan, referring to Ukraine’s largest steelworks that was privatised in 2004 by oligarchs close to the then-president.
Movchan said that this form of nationalism has given those in power a tool to ignore Ukraine’s social issues, but that people need to be clear that Ukraine’s internal problems are not to blame for the war. “The cause of the war is the Russian Federation,” said Movchan."

Fierce battles have continued to rage in eastern Ukraine with Russian troops on the verge of encircling a key industrial city, bringing a sharp rebuke of the west from Volodymyr Zelenskiy for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war.
As the Ukrainian military reported on Thursday that 40 towns in the Donbas region were under Russian bombardment, Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday described fighting outside Sievierodonetsk, a key military goal for Russia, as “very difficult”, saying Russian troops were shelling the city from the outskirts with mortars.
“The coming week will be decisive,” Gaiday said in a video posted on Telegram, adding he believes Russia’s goal is to “capture the Luhansk region no matter what cost”.
“There is a colossal amount of shelling,” he added.
Having failed to seize Ukraine’s capital or its second city, Kharkiv, after invading in February, Russia is trying to take full control of the Donbas, comprised of two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.
Russia has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk and its twin, Lysychansk. Their fall would leave the whole of Luhansk province under Russian control, a key Kremlin war aim.
“The occupiers shelled more than 40 towns in Donetsk and Luhansk region, destroying or damaging 47 civilian sites, including 38 homes and a school. As a result of this shelling five civilians died and 12 were wounded,” the joint task force of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Facebook.
The statement said 10 enemy attacks were repelled, four tanks and four drones destroyed, and 62 “enemy soldiers” were killed.
Gaiday said police in Lysychansk were collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves. About 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added.
Families of people buried in mass graves will be able to carry out a reburial after the war, and police are issuing documents enabling Ukrainians to secure death certificates for loved ones, Gaiday said.
Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday that Russian troops “heavily outnumber us” in some parts of the east and echoed pleas from his foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba to the World Economic Forum in Davos for more weaponry from the west.
“We need the help of our partners - above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Zelenskiy said in his daily address to the nation.
And he called out the international community for paying too much attention to Russia’s interests and too little to Ukraine’s.
The Ukrainian president took specific aim at former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and the New York Times for suggesting territorial sacrifices might be necessary to end the conflict.
Kissinger, the 98-year-old champion of realpolitik, this week told World Economic Forum attendees in Davos that a return to the “status quo” before Russia’s February 24 invasion would be ideal. Russia had formally annexed Crimea in 2014, while separatist groups aligned with Moscow have long controlled the easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Pushing Moscow to surrender that territory threatened to turn the conflict into a new, broader war, Kissinger warned, adding that negotiations needed to begin within two months.
“It seems Mr Kissinger’s calendar is not 2022, but 1938,” Zelensky responded, comparing his suggestion to the agreement that ceded part of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany more than 80 years ago.
UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine, during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
“Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say, noting concessions made to Putin before operations were launched in Georgia, the Crimea and Donbas.
Russia’s invasion of its pro-western neighbour has caused global shockwaves, with the latest being fears of food shortages, particularly in Africa.
Moscow blamed the international sanctions imposed after the invasion, while the west says the shortage is mainly down to Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports.
“Solving the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the removal of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,” said Russian deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko.
But Kuleba urged delegates at Davos in Switzerland not to give in. “This is clear blackmail. You could not find a better example of blackmail in international relations,” Kuleba told the WEF in Davos. Kuleba also slammed the western military alliance Nato for “doing literally nothing” to stop Russia.
In other developments:
In a sign that the rest of the country remains at risk, Russian cruise missiles struck the major southern rail hub of Zaporizhzhia, killing one person and damaging dozens of houses, the presidency added.
President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday signed a decree simplifying a procedure to obtain a Russian passport for residents of the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson, under the full control of Russian troops, and partly-occupied Zaporizhzhia. Kyiv said the plan was a “flagrant violation” of Ukraine’s sovereignty.
The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/russian-soldier-pow-ukraine;2022-05-26;‘You shake at the smallest of noises’: Russian soldier tells of life as a PoW;"Anton, released by Ukraine in a prisoner exchange, says he is only now registering the toll captivity took on mind and body
Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm.
“It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian.
Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea.
Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory.
Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians.
Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities.
One of Anton’s family members further confirmed to the Guardian that he was captured in Ukraine and then exchanged. The Guardian was not able to verify all the details of his story.
Anton, who comes from a small, remote city in Siberia, said he signed a contract to join the military last December, shortly after graduating from vocational school.
In hindsight, he said, he should “have done everything” to avoid the army.
Anton’s unit was first transferred during the last days of December to the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, where he was told he was taking part in a “one-week” training course.
By that point, he claimed he had received practically no military training that would adequately prepare him for a full-scale war.
As weeks went by in Crimea, Anton said some members of his unit started to worry they would be sent to war, a prospect he still considered to be completely “absurd”.
“Many of the young guys couldn’t even imagine that we would go to war. They told us at the very last moment about this, the night before the invasion,” he said.
“Ultimately, it is really not fair how the Russian authorities treated me. I was sent to Ukraine completely unprepared.”
Anton’s account, which depicts a military unit that was kept in the dark about the invasion, echoes a number of other Russian soldiers who have similarly said that they did know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine. Military experts have argued that the decision to not tell a large number of its troops about the invasion is one explanation for Moscow’s halting military campaign.
On 25 February, the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Anton’s unit was ordered to cross into the country from Crimea.
He said they were driven in armoured vehicles to the outskirts of Mykolaiv, which was under heavy attack from Russian forces in the early days of the war.
As they continued on foot, part of the unit split from the main group and was ambushed by Ukrainian forces on 2 March, less than a week after entering the country. Anton said he was hit by a Ukrainian bullet while being captured, fracturing a bone in his hand.
Soon after, Ukrainian forces put a bag on his head as he was transferred to a prison cell, the location of which he said he still does not know.
At first, life in captivity was dominated by fear. “You shake at the smallest of noises. Every day you hope that this won’t be your last and you will not be killed,” Anton recalled.
He said that he was not physically assaulted during his time in captivity but alleged that Ukrainian guards would mentally torment him and other Russian soldiers.
“We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.”
Anton added that while some guards looked like “they wanted to hurt you”, the majority remained calm and “would not let their animal instinct set in”.
Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating prisoner exchanges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under the Geneva conventions, the detention of PoWs after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but as a means to prevent further participation in a conflict.
But it was the daily boredom that soon emerged as the biggest challenge, Anton said.
“If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television.
“Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity.
At one point, he was asked to record an interview about his capture with a prominent Ukrainian vlogger.
Ukrainian officials have given journalists and vloggers access to interview their Russian PoWs. Such videos have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube, but they have also faced criticism for violating the Geneva conventions.
“In such a situation, as a prisoner, you understand there isn’t really a choice to say no. You agree despite them saying that you could refuse,” Anton said.
Eventually, in early April, Anton was told that he was going to be exchanged for a Ukrainian soldier.
While Russia and Ukraine have engaged in several prisoner swaps, both countries have released almost no details on the mechanisms behind the exchanges. On 4 April, Ukraine said that it held about 600 Russian military prisoners of war. Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian PoWs in Russia.
That number has since grown significantly after at least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory when the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces last week. Ukraine has said that the Azovstal fighters would be involved in a prisoner swap, but some Russian officials have said they could be tried or even executed.
According to Anton, he was part of a one-for-one swap involving 17 other Russian soldiers, which took place near the Ukrainian city of Melitopol.
As soon as he was back in Russia, he was intensely questioned by the security services about his time in Ukraine.
“They wanted to know if they could still trust me. It was standard procedure,” he said.
But it was only days after he was discharged from a Russian hospital that he felt the full toll that his time in captivity had inflicted on his mind and body.
“During my captivity, I blocked most of my emotions. I just tried not to think about my life,” he said.
“But now, I have terrible dreams, I can barely sleep. I have gained a lot of weight,” he said.
Anton said the authorities had given him about £2,000 as compensation for his injuries. According to Russian military law, service people do not receive any special compensation for being held as a PoW, and Anton was expected to return to service once he had recovered from the injuries.
But after his experience in Ukraine, Anton is now looking for ways to quit the military for good.
“I just want to go back home, man, that is it. All I want is to go home.”"

Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine.
Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20m tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”.
Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. “Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace,” he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Oleksiy Arestovych, a presidential adviser, added: “No one is going to trade a gram of our sovereignty or a millimetre of our territory. Our children are dying, soldiers are being blown apart by shells, and they tell us to sacrifice territory. Get lost. It’s never going to happen.”
There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by Tass news agency as saying.
Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has said they cannot yet be 100% sure they have flushed every last Ukrainian fighter out of the Azovstal steel plant.
The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine”. He is reported to have said “Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation.”
Russia’s Ministry of Defence claims that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled.
Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion.
Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war.
Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit.
Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has said fighting is most intense in the Izyum region. He claimed “The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk.”
Police in Lysychansk are collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Some 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added, Reuters reports.
Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday.
Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.”
A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported.
Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria.
Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.”
Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.”
Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he believes Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. He said everyone in the world understands it is not “a special operation”, but that it is a genocide against the Ukrainian people.
German chancellor Olaf Scholz has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a thunderbolt, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms."

Moscow’s plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv has said, accusing the Kremlin of “criminal” behaviour.
“The illegal issuing of passports ... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier on Wednesday signed a decree simplifying the procedure to get a Russian passport for residents of the southern Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the initiative was further evidence of Moscow’s “criminal” war goals, namely the integration of regions held by Moscow’s army “into Russia’s legal, political and economic field”.
The official order published on Wednesday came on the heels of a 2019 decree that allowed the same fast-track procedure for residents of the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, eastern Ukraine’s breakaway regions.
Applicants are not required to have lived in Russia, do not need to provide evidence of sufficient funds or pass a Russian language test.
Kherson region is under the full control of Russian troops, while the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia is partially controlled by Moscow.
Moscow and pro-Moscow officials have said both regions could become part of Russia.
“The simplified system will allow all of us to clearly see that Russia is here not just for a long time but forever,” the Moscow-appointed deputy leader of the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency.
“We are very grateful to Russian president Vladimir Putin for all he is doing for us, for protecting Russian people in historically Russian lands that have now been liberated,” he added.
The new authorities wanted to help those wishing to “join the big family of Russia”, he said.
Applications would be processed within three months and the Kherson region had already begun work on launching centres to issue Russian passports, Stremousov said.
Several hundred thousand residents of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions have already received Russian passports.
On Monday, the authorities in Kherson introduced the rouble as the official currency alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia. On Wednesday, officials installed by Moscow announced the same measure in parts of the region of Zaporizhzhia."

The impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominated a delayed and slimmed-down World Economic Forum this year but it took George Soros to articulate what many of those making the trip to the Swiss Alps had been thinking.
Davos would not be Davos without a broadside from the 91-year-old philanthropist and former speculator, but the conflict in eastern Europe prompted his most apocalyptic warning yet.
“The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said.
Others were voicing similarly dark thoughts – some publicly, some privately. So much so, that at times it felt as if the meeting was taking place not in May 2022 but in July 1914 or August 1939, times past when the world has stood on the brink of the precipice.
The historian Adam Tooze said: “The war dominates everything. The nuclear escalation risk is not being priced in. This doesn’t feel like cold war. It’s hard to think of a time during the cold war when the US openly announced its policy was to eliminate the capacity of Russia to take independent military action.”
Similar sentiments were expressed by a senior policymaker who pointed out that a global pandemic had been unthinkable in early 2020, a near-coup in Washington incited by Donald Trump had been unthinkable in January 2021 and a war between Russia and Ukraine had been unthinkable at the start of 2022. “Why should we think the unthinkable ended with the start of the war?”
Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said the west’s military build-up in eastern Europe was designed to deter Vladimir Putin rather than provoke him, but even if Russia resists the temptation to push the nuclear button it has other ways to escalate the conflict.
Solidarity with Ukraine was total. In previous years, one of the hottest ticket at Davos was an invite to the champagne and caviar bashes thrown at the Russia House on the Promenade. This year, no Russians were invited and the party premises became the “Russia War Crimes House”, where Ukraine displayed evidence of atrocities committed since the start of the invasion.
But solidarity with Ukraine comes at a cost, as was clear from many of the sessions. It was taken as read that the war would be bad for the global economy, with the only dispute about exactly how bad. Estimates ranged all the way from a mild dose of stagflation through to Soros’s prediction of a depression.
There was no sense in Davos of the west easing its sanctions on Russia but fears over the health of the global economy reflected the fact that Putin has economic weapons at his disposal – energy and food – and has already shown a willingness to use both of them.
The Kremlin has cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, and the European Union expects to be hit by a blanket embargo this winter, assuming there is no early end to the war. Few in Davos believe peace will have broken out by the time the WEF’s annual meeting reverts to its normal mid-January slot in 2023. “We can handle it,” one European policymaker said, “but it is not going to be easy.”
Higher gas and petrol prices since the start of the war three months ago have added to inflationary pressures in many countries, prompting central banks to raise interest rates.
But for those attending Davos – and there were fewer of them than usual – it was food not energy that was the more immediate threat. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Putin was “weaponising food” by seizing Ukraine’s grain and blockading Black Sea ports.
Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund,, said: “The price of food is going up, up, up, up. We can shrink our use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day.”
Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), said developing countries were faced with a triple threat: a food crisis, a fuel crisis and a financial crisis. Sri Lanka was the first country to default on its debts since the start of the war, but the IMF fears it will not be the last to require its financial help.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. After two years dominated by the global pandemic, this was billed as the Davos where the global movers and shakers breathed a sigh of relief and planned for a sustainable recovery. The idea was to harness new technology to forge a green future in which growth would be consistent with tackling climate change.
In reality, the effects of the pandemic have lingered on, with China’s lockdowns to combat the spread of Covid-19 weakening global demand and adding to bottlenecks. Meanwhile, countries starved of Russian gas are turning to coal as a substitute.
As one climate change expert put it, countries made commitments at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.8C but had yet to turn pledges into action. As things stood, temperatures would rise by 4C.
In the longer term, the hope in Davos was that the war, and the vulnerability to Russia it has exposed, would hasten the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. The prospect of countries accelerating progress to net zero provided a rare glimpse of sunshine in what has otherwise been a sombre affair."

Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine.
Ukrainian prosecutors late on Tuesday released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria.
They say five are Russian soldiers, one is a Russian mercenary with the Wagner Group and the final two are Belarusian mercenaries.
The Guardian has previously reported on the alleged involvement of the soldiers named by prosecutors on Tuesday in the systematic torture and murder of civilians in Ukraine including the head of the village council and her husband and son.
There have been reports of Wagner fighters on the ground in Ukraine, but these are the first charges against allegedly serving mercenaries, and the first non-Russians charged.
Established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Wagner is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin and has faced western sanctions.
Russia has used paid fighters to bolster its forces since the start of the war. It was estimated to have deployed between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere, including Wagner Group fighters, in its offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region, a European official said last month.
A survivor had previously described to the Guardian how Russian soldiers who were perpetrating a sadistic killing spree lasting days in the village had described Ukraine as a “fairytale” compared with Syria.
Prosecutors said Sergey Vladimirovich Sazanov 51, born in the town of Rechitsa in Belarus, was one of about 300 Wagner mercenaries who participated in a February 2018 offensive in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. They cited the open source research group InformNapalm.
Another man, Alexander Alexandrovich Stupnitsky, 32, a native of Orsha in Belarus, was identified as a liaison officer for the assault platoon of the Wagner Group’s 1st reconnaissance and assault company.
The third man identified as a Wagner member, Sergey Sergeevich Sazonov, 33, was born in Kaliningrad and is allegedly the driver of the Wagner Group command vehicle.
Denis Korotkov, an expert on the Wagner Group, confirmed that two of the suspects had previously worked for the mercenary company. “Sazonov and Stupnitsky are in my files,” Korotkov told the Guardian. He said it was unusual for Belarusian citizens to fight with the group, because they could face jail sentences for it.
“It is likely that Sazonov and Stupnitsky fought in Syria,” he added. “They don’t have a particular reputation, just regular Wagner soldiers.”
None of the accused men are in custody, and prosecutors believe they may since have been relocated to frontline positions in the Donbas, where Putin has positioned most of his armed forces following their retreat from the area around Kyiv.
“There is a possibility that these men are still fighting in Ukraine, or that they will be killed during the fighting,”said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor in the Kyiv region. “We are still working on it and we will do everything possible to arrest them.”
Tkalenko said the investigation was based on photographic evidence, CCTV footage and reports of hundreds of survivors who confirmed the identities of their torturers.
Only three men survived the torture camp in Motyzhyn.
After killing the civilians, the soldiers buried them in mass graves around the camp. In one, investigators found the corpse of Olga Petrivna, the head of the village council of Motyzhyn, together with her husband and son. Petrivna had chosen to stay in the town and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived.
Tkalenko said that Ukrainian authorities had so far identified more than 5,000 Russian soldiers who were deployed north of Kyiv. “We are keeping records of all prisoners of war, and we know which ones committed war crimes.”
The list of alleged war criminals includes 15 other Russian soldiers charged with human rights abuses during the brutal month-long occupation of towns north of Kyiv. Anna Neistat of the Clooney Foundation for Justice said Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office had signalled that it wanted to lead the overall effort while showing a willingness to accept help from the international community.
“They are very active. To date they’ve opened 11,000 cases,” said Neistat. “For the first time in decades, in a conflict situation, we have a national prosecutor who is able to lead these investigations and it’s absolutely right” that Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines.
“Having said that, there is a danger of the prosecutors are getting overwhelmed because it’s huge number of cases,” said Neistat, who noted that instead of obstructing parallel investigations, the prosecutor’s office had been open to international support and was active in coordinating parallel investigations being launched elsewhere.There has been unprecedented interest in building cases by foreign prosecutors and NGOs over the crimes committed in Ukraine. More than a dozen national prosecutors outside of Ukraine have opened cases into war crimes or crimes of aggression. The international criminal court opened its investigation just four days after the invasion. On Monday, a court in Kyiv sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine."

Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled.
The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said delays in arrival of western arms to the frontline had left Kyiv “catastrophically short of heavy weapons”.
The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit.
Haidai added that Russian forces were attempting to “completely destroy” the city of Sievierodonetsk in an attempt to conquer the Donbas region, near Russia’s border.
“They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the Earth,” Haidai said on his Telegram channel.
“At the moment, with the support of artillery, the Russian occupiers are attacking Sievierodonetsk,” Haidai added.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation in Donbas was “extremely difficult”, with the Russian army bringing its full force to bear. Footage from recent days from frontline areas, posted on social media, has depicted a constant barrage of artillery and rocket fire raining down on key roads and Ukrainian positions.
Recent video footage posted by AFP photographer Aris Messinis in Donbas showed shells hitting close to a road in the country’s east and the constant sound of incoming artillery fire.

After failing to seize Kyiv or Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, Russia is trying to take the rest of the separatist-claimed Donbas’s two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front.
In the easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield as Russian forces have advanced from three directions to encircle them.
Assessment of Russian operations by western analysts suggests that rather than encircle Ukrainian forces in one large and all-encompassing effort, Russia is attempting to carve up Ukrainian-held territory into several small encirclements to the same effect.
The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its 24 May update that Russian troops “are instead attempting to secure smaller encirclements and focus on Sievierodonetsk”, adding that Ukrainian forces were also probably conducting a controlled withdrawal south-west of the town of Popasna to protect Ukrainian supply lines against Russian offensives.
Russia appears to have deployed higher quality troops from a so-called operational manoeuvre group to spearhead the operation around Sievierdonestsk, with some reports suggesting that Russian aircraft were flying several hundred sorties a day in support of the attack.
Russian forces also appear to be benefiting from better supply lines in the Luhansk region with Ukrainian officials appealing for more western heavy weapons – including multiple launch rocket systems – for their outgunned defenders.
In the city of Sloviansk west of Donbas, many residents took advantage of what Ukraine said was a break in the Russian assault to leave. “My house was bombed, I have nothing,” said Vera Safronova, seated in a train carriage among the evacuees.
Along with the eastern Donbas region, Moscow is also targeting southern Ukraine and has blockaded ships that would normally export Ukrainian grain and sunflower oil through the Black Sea, pushing up prices globally and threatening lives.
Russia, which has blamed Ukraine and the west for the food crisis, said it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine but said western sanctions would need to be lifted in return.
Three months into the invasion, Russia still has only limited gains to show for its worst military losses in decades, while much of Ukraine has suffered devastation as Moscow stepped up artillery strikes to compensate for its slow progress.
Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said it was deliberately advancing slowly in what it calls its “special operation” to avoid civilian casualties, comments Zelenskiy dismissed as “absolutely unreal”.
“We will continue the special military operation until all the objectives have been achieved,” Shoigu told the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russian-led military alliance of former Soviet states. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, also said Moscow’s offensive would last as long as necessary.
“We are not rushing to meet deadlines,” he said."

Prague’s central railway station seems a picture of normality amid warm spring sunshine and the return of legions of tourists, who had been largely absent at the height of Covid. On the platform one weekday morning, two German sightseers gaze curiously at the statue of Sir Nicholas Winton, the British stockbroker who helped 669 mostly Jewish children escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia on the eve of the second world war.
Yet just yards away, hundreds of Roma people are sheltering in the only place available to them since they joined the millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion.
Unlike other Ukrainians who have been offered refugee visas, these families have found they have nowhere to go and no one who wants them.
On the morning the Guardian visited, two small boys played unsupervised, perilously close to the platform’s edge. Nearby, a young mother lay asleep on a blanket as her infant toddler crawled over her.
The scene was symptomatic of a festering crisis that has unfolded in recent weeks, as hundreds of Roma refugees have sheltered on the station floor and in a makeshift sleeper train that berths only between 9pm and 5am, in what emergency workers say are dangerously unsanitary conditions.
More than 500 people are crammed each night into quarters that were originally envisaged to accommodate 260 on a one-night-only basis. Some have stayed for up to 10 nights.
Volunteer aid workers say they are overstretched and overwhelmed. “This is the most important situation in the Czech Republic,” says Geti Mubeenová, crisis coordinator with the Organisation for Aid to Refugees (OPU).
Along with other voluntary groups helping at the station, the OPU plans to end its work there at the end of the month in an effort to pressure the government into providing more suitable accommodation.
“We were set up to provide information, but now we are dealing with a humanitarian crisis. It is no longer sustainable,” says Mubeenová.
Out of sight of ordinary passengers in a sealed-off area of the ornate Habsburg-era station, Roma families – mostly women and children, some elderly and disabled – sit and lie around, surrounded by bags of belongings and protected by security guards, many of them also Roma.
Many are waiting for Czech authorities to decide on their status and whether they qualify for permanent accommodation; others are in an even bleaker situation.
“We tried to register for refugee protection at the registration centre but they wouldn’t accept us and didn’t give us any document explaining why,” says Zanna, a teenage mother of three children from Kyiv, who says she had arrived in Prague with her family four days earlier.
“We came here looking for a place to stay but instead we are just lying on the floor like dogs. We are exhausted and have no energy any more. I’m just feeling really hopeless.”
It is a tale typical of many Roma arrivals, aid workers say.
Since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine on 24 February, the Czech Republic has issued about 350,000 temporary protection visas to refugees.
Many Roma have faced a different fate, driven – according to Mubeenová – by an anti-Roma prejudice that is widespread in the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries. Many Roma who left Prague for Germany later returned, she says, including some who reported that police in Dresden refused to allow them to disembark from their train.
Czech officials say many Roma arrivals do not qualify for refugee status because they are EU citizens holding dual Ukrainian-Hungarian nationality – thanks to a policy enacted by Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, in 2011, of offering citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia region.
Some of the Hungarian passport holders claim they were bribed into applying for the documents, not understanding the consequences of dual citizenship. Several told the Guardian they left the Czech Republic for Budapest only to return to Prague after authorities in Hungary rejected their passports as forgeries.
Holding EU citizenship protects them from deportation under Schengen rules while affording freedom of movement between member states – but it also potentially leaves them in limbo when states are not obliged to provide accommodation under protected status arrangements.
However, Mubeenová says only a fifth of the current station inhabitants hold Hungarian citizenship. The fate of others, who often face obstacles to submitting applications or even entering registration centres, reflects hardening official attitudes that dismiss Roma arrivals as bona fide refugees.
Vít Rakušan, the Czech interior minister, has claimed that the Roma influx is tied to organised crime and spoken of the need to combat “social tourism”.
Mubeenová says: “I have sat in meetings with representatives of Prague city hall, the police etc, and noticed the narrative changing – people stopped talking about refugees and started referring to ‘economic migrants’ and ‘welfare tourists’.
“Representatives have told me that they don’t have the necessary documents to apply for protection, but they are often not even allowed to submit applications and that’s not legal.”
A spokesperson for the Czech interior ministry – which is responsible for the processing of refugees – says those at the railway station who had applied for temporary protection were entitled to state-provided accommodation, including at a recently established “tent city” in the Prague neighbourhood of Troja.
“It happens that some people refuse this offer and return to the main station. However, there are also people staying at the station who are not entitled to temporary protection or who have not applied for temporary protection at all,” he says.
“When an application for temporary protection is submitted, an assessment is made, in accordance with the legislation in force, as to whether the person concerned is eligible. If it turns out that the applicant is a citizen of another EU member state, then temporary protection cannot be granted.”
The increasingly dire situation at the station has led to instances of chickenpox, measles, hepatitis A, lice, scabies and tuberculosis being reported by medical students working as volunteers. Firefighters disinfect the premises three times a day.
Hygiene restrictions prevent aid agencies distributing hot, cooked food. In the absence of regular meals, many refugees leave during daytime and go into Prague city centre, where some resort to begging.
Jan Vágner, the station’s building manager, describes the current situation as “more challenging” than early in the refugee crisis, when more than 5,000 people poured off trains arriving from Ukraine.
“Even though the numbers are far fewer now, we need to talk to them all individually and work closely with them, but we don’t have the right kind of help,” he says.
Amid the chaos, however, one man has a relatively happy story. Stick thin and wearing a white cap, Heorhii Stan, 37, originally from Odesa, was preparing to travel to Vienna with his four children to collect his wife after successfully applying for protected status in the Czech Republic.
His relief was sharpened by having spent four nights at the railway station, an experience he described as “tough and hopeless” before being moved to an isolated refugee camp generally reserved for Roma in the Bohemian forest. “I really want to integrate here and ensure my kids go to school,” he says. “And I want to work.”

Igor Volobuyev spent two decades working in the heart of the Russian business establishment, first for Gazprom and then for its affiliate Gazprombank, where until February this year he was vice-president.
Then Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine in late February, and Volobuyev decided he could no longer stand living in Russia. He packed a small rucksack of possessions and a stack of cash, and flew out of the country on 2 March, pretending he was going on holiday.
A few days later, he crossed from Poland into Ukraine, where he spent his childhood years. Now, he spends his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service.
“I want to go to the place where I can defend my homeland with a weapon, I’m trying every day,” he said, in an interview in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. “I am never going back to Russia.”
Hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have fled the country since Putin launched the war, and many intellectuals, journalists and activists have voiced their opposition to the conflict. However, among the political and business elites, defections have been extremely rare. Despite reports of widespread dismay over the invasion of Ukraine, only a tiny handful of people have spoken publicly to condemn the war.
On Monday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war. When he resigned, Bondarev published a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster”.
Bondarev said he made his mind up to resign on the day Russia launched its invasion, but it took months to gather the resolve to go public.
Like many fellow diplomats, Bondarev had remained in his post over the past decade, despite Russia’s growing isolation due to a series of crises, including its annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.
“You understand that it is wrong,” he said in a telephone interview. “That it’s not good. But it doesn’t really touch you, your life. These bad things they happen somewhere far away. It’s not right but that’s how most people think.”
“But now this is totally different: Russia attacked another country. This is Ukraine who we always considered to be our brothers and attacked them in the most brutal manner. Bombing cities. Claiming them to be Nazis and denazified. It’s something ridiculous. It’s something unimaginable.”
Bondarev said he believed many of his fellow diplomats were also opposed to the war, but he never discussed it with them. “It isn’t something you really talked about with other people, it isn’t something you can speak about openly these days,” Bondarev said. “Everyone is silent.”
Volobuyev said that after 2014, he had started to speak openly about his concerns over Russian politics in the workplace, and while many people were scared of getting involved in a discussion, he felt that most people he knew agreed at least partially.
“In Gazprom there were a few passionate Putinists, but the majority of people understood exactly what kind of country they lived in. A lot of people in Russia are just scared,” he said.
“You have this internal censorship, that it’s dangerous to say certain things, and you live with this permanently. Ukrainians look at this and they don’t understand it because they are a free people,” he said.
Volobuyev grew up in the Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka , and left for Moscow in 1989, when he was 18. After spending some time in journalism, he joined Gazprom, where he worked for 15 years before moving to become one of Gazprombank’s vice-presidents in 2015.
As he tells it, he was originally a supporter of Putin, and voted for him in 2012, but his “eyes were opened” by the Maidan revolution in 2014 and subsequent Russia-backed war in Donbas. He wanted to return to Ukraine then, but said he could not, for family reasons, about which he declined to elaborate.
“It was a choice between my homeland and my family, and at that time I chose my family. On 24 February this year, I understood I could not put it off any longer,” he said.
Volobuyev was a mid-ranking cog in the Gazprom machine; among the higher business echelons few people have dared to break ranks.
Oleg Tinkov, a self-made billionaire who set up one of Russia’s leading banks, has so far been the most outspoken public opponent of the war among the business elite. In one of a series of critical Instagram posts, Tinkov wrote: “I don’t see ANY beneficiary of this crazy war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying.”
After his statements, Tinkov said he was forced to sell his assets at a knockdown price to an oligarch loyal to the Kremlin. In an interview with the Russian journalist Yury Dud, he said he was sure that the entire business elite backed his statements but were too scared to say the same publicly.
“I have spoken to 12 of the top 20 on the Forbes list personally, and they all support me, there is a full consensus,” he said.
He said half of those he had spoken to justified their silence by claiming to fear for their tens of thousands of employees, who could be affected if they fell out of favour with the Kremlin.
“The other half say, ‘We’ll make a statement and then lose our business, like you, and then what, what have you achieved?’”
Putin has referred to those who oppose Moscow’s actions as “scum and traitors”, whom the Russian people will “spit out like a fly”. In the current climate it is clear that public opposition to the war makes it dangerous to return to Russia.
Bondarev said he was worried about the response to his statement and said he would “welcome” an offer of asylum in the west. Tinkov has said he has hired bodyguards.
As a Russian citizen of Ukrainian origin, Volobuyev’s position is a little different. His arrival in Ukraine has given him a feeling that he has finally returned home, he said. But he accepts that he has a lot of work to do to persuade Ukrainians of his sincerity.
“All these years, I said I was Ukrainian but I continued to live and work there. I understand that I have to repent, and to prove for many years that I should be allowed to live here and that I can be trusted,” he said."

In an age of social media and satellite television, the singular wartime news bulletin evokes images of families tuning in to the radio during the second world war. But in Ukraine, the state-backed broadcast has remerged, albeit with a 21st-century spin.
Shortly after Russia invaded, the country’s main TV channels started broadcasting the same content 24 hours a day, nicknamed the United News telemarathon. Each channel has a daily slot on the broadcast, which is shown simultaneously on all the channels.
United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels. It has since been signed into law and now includes all Ukrainian channels that used to show news.
The head of Ukraine’s parliamentary broadcasting committee said he believed the arrangement should continue until the war ends.
While some say there are critical strategic justifications for the telemarathon, others argue that it amounts to a monopoly of the information space by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and could be exploited for political purposes.
“The telemarathon is the information war equivalent of our anti-aircraft systems and I think it’s the most optimal option for Ukraine right now,” said Svitlana Ostapa, the deputy head of Detector Media, a media monitoring organisation that tracks propaganda, disinformation and political interference in Ukraine. “It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population.
In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that experts said worked to destabilise the country.
There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together. “Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,” Ostapa said. “The top ministers and officials do not have the time to comment to more than half a dozen channels, and this format means they are communicating with the population once a day and not being seen to favour one channel.”
The language used by Ukraine’s TV presenters has changed dramatically, reflecting usage among the wider population. Russian soldiers are often called “occupiers”, “terrorists”, “orcs” and “Rashists” – a combination of the words Russian and fascist.
Guests are welcomed with the greeting “Glory to Ukraine!”, to which they answer “Glory to the heroes!”. The famous words of a Ukrainian soldier tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, who was recorded over the military radio saying “Russian ship go fuck yourself”, are mentioned without the swearword being censored, and the presenters regularly end their segments with “Death to the enemy!”, a historic Ukrainian wartime slogan.
The 24-hour wartime news focuses on the Ukrainian military’s victories, its defence of Ukraine’s frontlines and Russia’s war crimes. The abrupt collapse of Ukraine’s economy in February means there is almost no advertising. Commercial breaks advertise hotlines for finding missing loved ones and reporting war crimes, as well as videos produced by normal Ukrainians, the Ukrainian army press service and the presidential office about the resistance of Ukrainian soldiers and citizens.
Ostapa said the language and messaging were discussed in editorial meetings between all the channels involved, the culture ministry and the national broadcasting council, and there was now a move to ban slogans containing swearwords. The overarching editorial message of the telemarathon is Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russian brutality, Ostapa wrote in one her analysis pieces.
The TV channel heads have rejected accusations that the authorities dictate the content, saying dialogue with officials includes things such as censoring information that reveals Ukrainian military positions. And since May, Ukrainians looking for an alternative to news can tune in to other channels that show films and cartoons about good winning out against evil.
But some see the unified TV coverage as propagandistic and point to the fact that airtime is now almost exclusively given to people close to the president, including regular comedy sketches by the president’s former comic colleagues.
“The telemarathon is an attempt by the presidential office to gain even greater control over the information space,” said Aksenyia Kurina, a journalist and campaigner who has spent her career focusing on censorship in Ukraine. “We may soon find ourselves in a heavily censored information space.”
Zelenskiy won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election with more than 70% of the vote, thanks in large part, said Kurina, to his innovative digital campaign. Zelenskiy’s party also controls Ukraine’s parliament.
Though Ukraine’s media have celebrated a marked change in their president since the invasion, Zelenskiy was on terse terms with some journalists before the war. He was known to publicly display disdain towards journalists who asked critical questions, and his press service ostracised some reporters for critical coverage.
“The telemarathon does not reflect reality, it forms a picture that the authorities would like to see. This is dangerous, because at some point the authorities may begin to believe in their own propaganda,” said Kurina. “I understand that many journalists are not able to cope with their emotions at the moment, for many this is a personal traumatic experience, but it is important to remember professional ethics and not to allow hate speech.”
Notably, three channels owned by Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko and that are close to his associates have not been given slots and therefore do not contribute to the telemarathon’s content or editorial meetings. Poroshenko was charged with treason after Zelenskiy came to power, a case that the former president says is politically motivated.
At first, Poroshenko’s channels split their coverage 50-50 between the telemarathon and their own content. But since in mid-March all channels – except for those dedicated to light entertainment – are obliged to stream the telemarathon.
The head of one of Poroshenko’s channels has said that despite their appeals to be included, they are still waiting to hear from the authorities."

Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, he added. “The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now.”
Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building.
The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.”
The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building.
Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation.
Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers found in formerly occupied towns in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war or for Ukrainian bodies. In Kharkiv, 60 bodies were retrieved and stacked in a refrigerated rail carriage, Reuters reports.
Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park which was hit by about 50 shells in three months of war. “Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crimes. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko said.
A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that only 10% of respondents found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace.
Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. Turkey’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting.
A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies.
Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. Soros added that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression."

Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners.
Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov battalion, was able to briefly call his wife, Kateryna, who said she had also been told that the prisoners had not been subjected to violence. It was not immediately clear if Prokopenko had been able to speak freely during the conversation.
“He said he was ‘OK’ and asked how I was,” Kateryna Prokopenko told the Guardian on Tuesday. “I’ve heard from other sources that the conditions are more or less satisfactory.”
At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces.
The Azov battalion has played a central role in Russia’s justification for its invasion, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. Officials in Kyiv have suggested they could be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials have called for them to face trial or even execution on “terrorism” charges.
Previously, the only news of the fighters’ conditions had come via a news channel given access to the prison by the Russian Ministry of Defence. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is involved in monitoring the conditions for prisoners of war and has a long-held policy of not publicly commenting, has not issued a statement.
“They are being fed, given water. The conditions meet the requirements and they have not been subjected to violence during this short period,” said Kateryna Prokopenko. “What will happen next, of course, we don’t know but at the moment there are third parties – the UN and the Red Cross – who are controlling the situation.”
Most of the injured Azov fighters are being held in a prison in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk, but a smaller group of severely injured fighters are in a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Prokopenko said that to her knowledge none of the fighters have been taken to Russia.
Russia’s propaganda narrative of the war has long played up the influence of the battalion, claiming that its members are neo-Nazis.
Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. Since then, it has been integrated in the Ukrainian army and Azov commanders say its fighters hold a range of political opinions.
Kateryna Prokopenko has launched an independent organisation to campaign for the Azovstal fighters who also include Ukrainian border guards and members of the Ukrainian security services.
“The aim of the organization is to organise weekly calls with those being held prisoners, to debunk Russian fakes about our guys, to ensure that their conditions remain satisfactory – a bed, medicine, water and food, and to campaign for their swift release,” said Kateryna."

Fished out of the water, smashed asunder, is a Ukrainian TB2 drone, retrieved in the last couple of days off the coast of Romania and almost certainly a legacy of a bold attempt to retake Snake Island earlier in the month.
The previously inconsequential low-lying 17-hectare (42-acre) rock, nearly 30 miles from the coasts of Ukraine and Romania, has become of growing strategic importance as Russia seeks to maintain its blockade of Ukraine’s remaining coastline.
For all the videos of TB2 drones destroying Russian air defence systems, helicopters and landing craft this month, Ukraine has failed in its attempt to retake the island, memorably lost in the first days of the war when its garrison told the attacking Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”.
Over the weekend a Togolese-flagged vessel passing near Snake Island was warned by the Russians to “leave the territorial waters of Russia, otherwise weapons will be used”, according to the Ukrainian navy. It amounted to “illegally appropriating Ukrainian territory”, the navy added.
Russia’s navy has dominated the Black Sea since the war began, not least because Ukraine had no real maritime force to speak of. It had lost three-quarters or more of its navy during Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its only remaining frigate was deliberately scuttled days after the war started to prevent its capture.
However, Russia lost its flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, in the middle of April to a Neptune cruise missile strike from Ukraine’s mainland. The ship had provided air and sea defence capability to the remainder of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, consisting of 20 or more warships and submarines.
The Moskva had helped capture Snake Island, and without it the Russian fleet was pushed back further from Ukraine’s coast (Neptune missiles have a range of up to 200 miles), bringing the island back into play. Russia’s determination to hang on to the rock shows it is, in effect, an alternative to the sunken ship.
“Think of it as an unsinkable destroyer,” said Andy Netherwood, an air defence expert. “If you place a radar and surface-to-air missile systems there, it allows you to dominate the airspace in the northern Black Sea, including the strategically important approach to Odesa.”
Russia has used its dominance of the Black Sea to launch Kalibr cruise missile attacks on Ukrainian targets, including from submarines. The missiles can have a range of 1,200 miles, able in theory to strike virtually anywhere in Ukraine.
But if anything it is the economic aspect that has come to the fore. “In a conflict of attrition and erosion, the ability to maintain an economic blockade can become significant. World war one comes to mind,” said Dr Sidharth Kaushal, a naval power expert with the Rusi thinktank, referring to the long British naval blockade of Germany that is widely believed to have helped bring about the Central powers’ eventual collapse towards the end of 1918.
Ukraine, however, is a net exporter of food, particularly grain and sunflower oil. It previously moved 70% of its exports by sea, including 99% of its grain deliveries to countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Yemen. Although some grain is now moving by land, it will not be enough.
Discussions have turned to the idea of creating a protective naval convoy for merchant shipping bound for Ukraine, as proposed by Lithuania this week. But while the UK and others are sympathetic, it would require broad international support, including, Royal Navy sources suggested on Tuesday, from China.
It would also require the involvement of Turkey, which closed the straits to all warships – except those returning to their home port – at the end of February, a situation welcomed by Ukraine at the time because it prevented more Russian warships from entering the Black Sea.
Opening the straits would allow limited access for Nato warships, for up to 21 days at a time under the 1936 Montreux convention, but also for Russia – meaning any convoy solution may have to be agreed with Moscow. It would also require a de-mining of the Ukrainian coast, somewhat hastily defended when the war broke out.
Amid such complications, attention remains focused on military solutions. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said on Monday that Denmark would send to Ukraine a Harpoon cruise missile system, with a similar operational range to the Neptune – the first declared deployment of such a naval system.
That will help keep the Russian warships away from Ukraine’s coast, although Moscow’s Kilo-class submarines remain able to roam far more freely. Despite the attempts to take back Snake Island and the growing international calls to reopen the Black Sea, Russia’s grip on the strategic body of water remains firm.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/pete-buttigieg-says-us-backs-new-marshall-plan-to-rebuild-ukraine;2022-05-24;Pete Buttigieg calls for new Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine;"Exclusive: Transportation secretary says there is global support for reconstruction effort to help recovery from Russian invasion
A leading figure in the Biden administration has backed a recovery programme for Ukraine in the style of the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war.
Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said there was plenty of political will at home and internationally towards cooperating in long-term reconstruction efforts including to buttress existing infrastructure in Ukraine.
“With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” the former presidential candidate said in an interview with the Guardian.
Buttigieg admitted that while “the destruction of Ukrainian homes and infrastructure is still under way”, to talk about reconstruction might feel premature “and yet in my encounters with Ukrainian leaders, and particularly my counterpart [Oleksandr Kubrakov], who I speak to regularly, they are already thinking about reconstruction even as they’re thinking about defending their homeland and it’s inspiring to see and it deserves strong and unified support from us.”
He said a “major topic of conversation” among transport ministers at the world meeting in Leipzig this week for the International Transport Forum was how they could help to get grain and other produce out of Ukraine, which is stuck because of blocked and destroyed ports and railway lines and is threatening to create a global food shortage.
“This is not only something that concerns us, as friends to Ukraine, but also concerns us because the world needs that production, especially on the agricultural side,” he said.
“Without access to the Black Sea, it’s always going to be a major disadvantage. We’re committed to helping there in any way we can.
“But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west.
“But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.”
Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war.
The plan was named after George Marshall, the man who was then US secretary of state.
Buttigieg, who is in charge of implementing and overseeing a large swathe of projects in the US enabled under the $1tn (£800bn) infrastructure bill that passed six months ago, stressed the relevance to the US as well as Ukraine of Marshall’s insistence about the need to create a “virtuous circle” between the economic security of a nation and its political stability based on its capacity to deliver.
He said that decades of disinvestment in the US had turned the virtuous cycle into a vicious one, with political institutions that lacked the resources to deliver well losing their legitimacy, leading to an erosion of trust, “which has given credence to those who would undermine those institutions, further diminishing their capacity to deliver”, he said.
The infrastructure fund was intended to break that cycle, he added. “If we can deliver as we’re setting out to do … then citizens will see what it means for them. We’ve got all kinds of things that have scrambled up our political and social life right now, including the information environment, the forms of extremism … and shocks like the pandemic, and economic reverberations from the war in Europe. It’s all the more reason for us to focus on delivering for people.”
He said that the stakes included not just comfort and convenience, but “perhaps also the credibility of governance itself”.
“In the 1930s, another season when democracy was in doubt, and when it had become fashionable in some circles in Washington to point approvingly to the rise in dictators, some would say by way of praise for fascism that Mussolini makes the trains run on time.
“This turns out to not be particularly true, by the way … but how revealing it is that this excuse for autocrats comes on the basis of their supposed prowess in providing transportation.”
Regarding Ukraine, Buttigieg said he was interested in President Volodymr Zelenskiy’s calls for reconstruction on a cities and regional level, under a plan apparently gaining traction, by which cities and communities across the world would adopt similar communities in Ukraine to their own ones.
“Understanding the needs and different capacities of different parts of the country is going to be very important,” Buttigieg said.
Asked if his government’s legitimacy over helping to rebuild a country was to be trusted after its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Buttigieg, who served in the country as an officer in the US Navy Reserve, said:
“Part of what we were up against in Afghanistan is just how fundamentally different the society, the values, the governance culture and the economics of that country are … it’s very different in Ukraine … one of the things that unites us to Ukraine are some of those core values around democracy.
“It’s so early to know what will be at the end of this upheaval. What we know is that the kind of united approach we have that reflects shared values among our partners and with Ukrainians is a very powerful one and will be an important basis of the relationship.
“Not just in getting us through this war, whatever the endgame looks like, but in a reconstruction that really does hold the promise of leading to new and innovative things.”
He praised the leadership he said Germany had shown since the start of the invasion, contrasting with the criticism the government of Olaf Scholz has received.
“I think it’s understood in Washington that the new steps that Germany has taken are major steps in security and energy policy … none of us knows what lies on the other side of this Zeitenwende,” he said, adopting the phrase used by Scholz meaning “turning point”, “but all of us should recognise that the only way for it to lead to a good place is for us to find our way to it together.”
Earlier on Thursday, Buttigieg took a tour of Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof or central station, a symbol of German unification, and met a group of Germans and US citizens of Ukrainian origin working as volunteers to receive refugees, about 2,000 of whom are arriving on trains from Ukraine each day.
“Just make sure you help us by keeping the narrative alive back home,” one of the volunteers, Natalia, from Minnesota and of Ukrainian descent, told him as Buttigieg thanked the women for their work.
Buttigieg, who ran for the US presidency in 2020 but withdrew in favour of supporting Joe Biden, would not be drawn on whether he had plans to run again in 2024.
“Right now my ambitions are to be the best secretary of transportation that I can,” he said. “I think there’s never been a better time to have this job.”

The headline was amended on 24 May 2022 to better reflect that Pete Buttigieg had called for a new Marshall plan for Ukraine, rather than this being decided US policy as an earlier version may have implied."

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned.
In a ferocious attack on Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Soros warned that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression.
Soros, who has become a hate figure for the hard right in the US, also heavily criticised the former German chancellor Angela Merkel for cosying up to Moscow and Beijing.
With the mood in Davos already downbeat due to the war in Ukraine, Soros ramped up the gloomy rhetoric to new heights.
“The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said.
“The invasion of Ukraine didn’t come out of the blue. The world has been increasingly engaged in a struggle between two systems of governance that are diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society.”
The 91-year-old former hedge fund owner said the tide had started to turn against open societies in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001. “Repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege. Today China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society.”
Soros, who led the speculative financial attack that drove the pound out of the European exchange rate mechanism 30 years ago, said Europe had responded well to the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion.
“It will take a long time to work out the details, but Europe seems to be moving in the right direction. It has responded to the invasion of Ukraine with greater speed, unity and vigour than ever before in its history.”
He added: “But Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels remains excessive, due largely to the mercantilist policies pursued by former chancellor Angela Merkel. She had made special deals with Russia for the supply of gas and made China Germany’s largest export market. That made Germany the best performing economy in Europe but now there is a heavy price to pay. Germany’s economy needs to be reoriented. And that will take a long time.”
Soros said Putin had won Xi’s agreement to the Russian invasion at the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in early February. But he insisted the Chinese leader was not as strong as he believed.
“Xi harbours a guilty secret. He never told the Chinese people that they had been inoculated with a vaccine that was designed for the original Wuhan variant and offers very little protection against new variants.”
Soros said Xi was unable to “come clean” because he was at a delicate moment in his career. “His second term in office expires in the fall of 2022 and he wants to be appointed to an unprecedented third term, eventually making him ruler for life.”
China’s lockdowns to combat Covid-19 had pushed the economy into freefall but Xi was unable to admit he had made a mistake, he said.
“Coming on top of the real estate crisis the damage will be so great that it will affect the global economy. With the disruption of supply chains, global inflation is liable to turn into global depression.”
Contrary to general expectations, Xi may not get his coveted third term because of the mistakes he had made, Soros predicted.
“While the war rages, the fight against climate change has to take second place. Yet the experts tell us that we have already fallen far behind, and climate change is on the verge of becoming irreversible. That could be the end of our civilisation.
“Therefore, we must mobilise all our resources to bring the war to an early end. The best and perhaps only way to preserve our civilisation is to defeat Putin as soon as possible. That’s the bottom line.”"

The Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev has quit his role at a company connected to the Independent, shortly after being placed under economic sanctions by Canada for “directly enabling” the Russian war in Ukraine.
It means the former KGB agent now has no formal link to the British news outlet. His departure may have had the effect of protecting the Independent from any issues that might have arisen out of the sanctions.
Canada last week named Lebedev on a list of 14 prominent people who had “directly enabled Vladimir Putin’s senseless war in Ukraine and bear responsibility for the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine”. Canadian individuals and businesses are now banned from conducting business with him and connected entities.
The 62-year-old Russian bought the Independent for £1 in 2010, having previously taken control of London’s Evening Standard for the same sum the previous year. He later transferred control of the publications to his son Evgeny – a friend of Boris Johnson who was recently given a seat in the House of Lords by the prime minister, despite concerns from the security services. The two news outlets have since racked up huge losses, while giving the Lebedevs a degree of influence in British society, although the Independent has returned a profit in recent years.
Corporate filings show Alexander Lebedev stepped down as a director of Independent Print Ltd on Sunday, the day after it was publicly reported that he was on the Canadian sanctions list. The company, which published the print edition of the Independent until 2016, is owned by Evgeny, who is also an owner of the Independent and Evening Standard.
A spokesperson for the newspapers played down the importance of the elder Lebedev’s resignation from the IPL board of directors, saying he had not been actively involved in the news outlets since 2016. They said: “Alexander Lebedev has no role, commercial or otherwise, in the running of either the Independent or the Evening Standard.”
Alexander Lebedev rose to prominence as a banker in the 1990s in Russia before funding the opposition Novaya Gazeta outlet. His wife, Elena Perminova, 35, has continued to post updates on her widely followed Instagram account about fashion launches, with recent pictures showing the family on a holiday in Istanbul.
The decision to put Alexander Lebedev on the sanctions list has renewed scrutiny of the prime minister’s decision to award a peerage to his 42-year-old son. The government has so far failed to comply with a House of Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, arguing this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated to the upper house of parliament and could degenerate into “political point-scoring”.
The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Ellis, told parliament he did not believe it was in the public interest to release the correspondence relating to the decision, adding: “Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.”
The ownership of the Independent and Evening Standard has long been a source of intrigue. Since taking control of the outlets from his father, Evgeny Lebedev has sold minority stakes in them to a bank with close connections to the Saudi Arabian state.
This article was amended on 27 May 2022. An earlier version implied that Alexander Lebedev quit a “role” connected to the current publisher of the Independent newspaper, Independent Digital News and Media Limited. In fact, Alexander Lebedev resigned as a director of Independent Print Limited, which had been the publisher of the print edition of the newspaper until 2016. Text was also added to reflect that the Independent has returned a profit in recent years."

The governor of Luhansk has delivered a warning that it is too late for thousands of civilians to be evacuated from the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk, as it faced an intensive Russian assault to take the city and the parts of the province still held by Ukraine.
Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces who have been attempting to complete their encirclement of the pocket around the city, Sievierodonetsk and the towns and villages to its west have been under intense bombardment in recent days.
Fifteen thousand residents were still believed to be in the city hiding in shelters from what Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described as “the largest [offensive] on European soil since the second world war” while a defence ministry spokesman said the war was currently in its “most active phase.”
Russian forces have been attempting to cut Ukrainian supply lines to Sievierodonestsk by trying to control key roads to the west.
“At this point I will not say: get out, evacuate. Now I will say: stay in a shelter,” Sergiy Haidai said on his Telegram channel. “Because such a density of shelling will not allow us to calmly gather people and come for them.”
“The enemy has focused efforts on the offensive operation to encircle Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Now, with the support of artillery, they are conducting assault operations in the direction of Toshkivka and Ustynivka, near Lysychansk,” Haidai wrote.
Ukraine’s defence ministry reported on Monday that Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukrainian defences around Popasna in an attempt to push west toward Bakhmut, a crucial junction that serves as a command centre for much of the Ukrainian war effort.
“I looked up from my prayers and heard a frightening sound,” said 82-year-old Maria Mayashlapak a resident of Bakhmut which has seen repeated airstrikes. “Every day I pray to God asking to avoid injuries. God heard me. God is watching over me.”
According to the latest intelligence update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence, capturing Sievierodonetsk would put the whole of Luhannsk region under Russian control, an ambition flagged up by Russia last week.
In a further development, the defence correspondent of the Kyiv Independent tweeted late on Tuesday that Ukrainian defenders appeared to have ceded two towns outside the city Horlivka – south of Sievierodonetsk– under “extreme Russian pressure” to retreat to more defensible positions.
NEW COPY That appeared to be confirmed by Serhiy Hoshko, the head of the Svitlodarsk military administration who said Russian forces entered the town and hoisted a Russian flag on the city council building. END NEW COPY
It looks like the Ukrainian military has decided to cede the towns of Myronivsky and Svitlodarsk and retreat northwest to more reliable defense lines due to extreme Russian pressure in the Popasna-Bakhmut-Severodonetsk area.

The Donbas, which includes all of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, is Ukraine’s old industrial heartland running from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. Predominantly Russian-speaking, almost a third of the area was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014.
During his Monday night address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, underlined the violence of the fighting around Sievierodonetsk. “The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said, singling out the worst-hit towns of Bakhmut, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk.
“The Russian military is trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the captured areas of the Kharkiv region, they will not give up the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhya region and Donbas.
“In some places they are advancing, where they are pulling up reserves, where they are trying to strengthen their positions. In the coming weeks, the wars will be difficult, and we must be aware of this.”
Despite the stepped-up Russian efforts in the Donbas, and huge levels of destruction, some western officials pointed to the difficulties being faced by the Kremlin’s forces amid emerging criticism of the conduct of the campaign by Russian military bloggers.
“The Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalised effort in the eastern part of the country,” the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said on Friday, describing the Donbas fighting as very dynamic, with small towns and villages changing hands daily.
The lack of resources was underlined last week by an abrupt Russian withdrawal from areas near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city which has been bombarded since the start of the war. Some of those forces apparently were redeployed to the Donbas, but it was not enough to tip the scales on the battlefield.
“They really had to thin out the troops they had around Kharkiv, simply because they’re trying to hold to too much of a line with too few troops,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.
Away from Sievierodonetsk, there was also evidence that Russian forces were working to strengthen their tactical position around Kharkiv, having moved some troops from around the city to redeploy units to the fighting further south.
The latest fighting came as the bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official.
Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building.

The son of a Russian billionaire facing sanctions for supporting the dictator who runs Belarus has been linked to a £160m portfolio of London properties.
Said Gutseriev, a 34-year-old businessman with British and Russian nationality, appears to have spent years amassing a collection of at least seven properties in central London.
They range from large office buildings in the City to a pair of £17m townhouses in south Kensington knocked together to make one residence.
Said’s father, Mikhail Gutseriev, was blacklisted last year, by the EU in June and the UK in August, months after the violent repression of protests which threatened to bring to an end 26 years of autocratic rule by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. The UK government described Gutseriev as “a longstanding associate” of the president, who had used his business interests to support Lukashenko’s government.
The property collection emerged from the findings of a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Belarusian Investigative Center, part of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.
All of the properties examined were bought before Mikhail was sanctioned. Six were acquired between 2004 and 2012, when Said was either at school or university, or was just starting his career at the FTSE 100 commodities trader Glencore. Said attended £14,500 a term Harrow school before studying at Oxford.
Leaked documents suggest Said was given a head start thanks to his family’s wealth. One of the properties appears to ultimately belong to a trust established by his father in 2007. Said was listed as a beneficiary of the trust in official paperwork from 2008 and 2009 seen by the Guardian. The paperwork also names him as a beneficiary of a second trust, established in 2004 by his grandmother, Marem Gutserieva. Said controls a stake in Russneft, the Russian oil company that was part-owned by his father until the latter transferred his holding to his brother in August 2021.
A spokesperson for Said Gutseriev said he has no financial or commercial links to his father, and always acts in accordance with applicable law, including on sanctions. The spokesperson did not dispute Said’s ownership of any of the properties.
The information about assets linked to him in the UK raises questions about whether sanctions should apply to family members.
Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the thinktank Rusi, said: “One of the challenges that western countries will now be having is identifying the true extent of assets that should be frozen under sanctions regimes. It’s reasonable to look closely at assets owned by family members – not just asset purchases in recent years but transfers in the past.”
The properties that appear to be linked to Said were uncovered in analysis by Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, using data from the Land Registry, UK Companies House and offshore leaks obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Most were bought using companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven which allows company owners to remain hidden.
They include:
A £19m office block called the Gloucester Building on Avonmore Road.
Austin Friars House, London, a £41m office building at the centre of the City of London.
82-85 Fleet Street, London, a £70m office building in the City of London.
64-65 Vincent Square, London, an £8.7m office block near Victoria railway station.
A pair of £17m Grade II-listed stucco-fronted townhouses remodelled to create a single residence on Queen’s Gate Place, just south of Hyde Park.
A £2.5m mews house in Petersham Mews, Kensington.
A £5.7m townhouse on Green Street in Mayfair.
The Queen’s Gate Place home, a listed building near London’s Natural History Museum, has been used by Said as his main London residence. It underwent extensive renovations in 2013, with planning documents showing ornate, gold-painted walls, elaborately carved cornices, classically painted murals and chandeliers.
Another property, Lilly House at 13 Hanover Square in London, was sold for £69m in November last year.
Said’s net worth is estimated at $1.3bn (£1bn) by Forbes, a valuation the magazine said was based on stakes in oil, coal, retail and financial businesses, some of which were previously owned by his father.
Said is the major shareholder of SFI, a Russian company formerly called Safmar Financial Investments in which Mikhail was previously a “controlling shareholder”, according to its annual reports. Mikhail served alongside his son on SFI’s board until November 2021. SFI owns a stake in Russneft and in the online retailer M.Video, a business originally bought by the father.
In the last year, Said is understood to have severed some financial ties with companies previously linked to his father and with Russia and Belarus. He reportedly resigned in August 2021 as the head of ForteInvest, an oil refinery company where he had been made chief executive in 2014 at the age of 26. A company press release said Forteinvest was owned by his father’s Safmar Group as recently as late 2020. In August 2021, he sold his stake in the Belarus-based cryptocurrency exchange Currency.com, according to local media.
Ben Cowdock, the investigations lead for Transparency International UK, said: “Following the money is critical to making financial sanctions bite. Those who are targeted by sanctions may have shared their wealth among family, friends and associates.”
Said studied archaeology and anthropology at St Peter’s College, Oxford, and in 2019 the university created a Gutseriev fellowship after he donated £2.6m. When he married in 2016, Sting, Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias performed at the opulent celebrations, which took place in London and Moscow.
Gutseriev’s spokesperson said: “Mr Said Gutseriev does not have any financial or commercial links to Mr Mikhail Gutseriev and cannot be termed a business partner of his father’s. To suggest otherwise is factually incorrect. Mr Said Gutseriev is a British national and resident, he understands fully the scope and application of sanctions targeting his father, and always acts in accordance with applicable law.
“Any suggestion that he holds any funds or assets for, or makes funds or assets available to, his father is factually incorrect. He has no financial or business links to any sanctioned individuals or entities and acts in full compliance with UK sanctions. To suggest otherwise is factually incorrect.
“Mr Said Gutseriev is not a political figure and has no personal or financial links to the Russian or Belarussian governments.
“He urges a peaceful resolution to the fighting in Ukraine and condemns the alleged human rights abuses. Any instances of human rights abuses should be tried according to international law and anyone found guilty punished with the full force of the law.”
Mikhail Gutseriev did not respond to requests for comment."

There was a gruelling artillery duel between Ukrainian and Russian troops, positioned just four kilometres apart. Right in the middle, between the two frontlines, stood Ivan Mishchenko’s farmhouse, with his dozens of cows and 100 hectares (247 acres) of wheat fields, transformed into a bloody battleground for five consecutive days in early March.
“Two kilometres on the right were the Russian troops, two kilometres on the left were our troops,” said Mishchenko, 66, whose farm lies in the countryside around Pochepyn, a small village north of Kyiv.
“They were shooting so hard, as if it was some kind of computer game. The first two days I stayed in the house, but then it was so insufferable that I had to leave. When I returned, I was in shock. My house, the warehouse, the barns ... were all destroyed. I lost everything.”
Mishchenko, who has livestock and grain fields, is one of hundreds of Ukrainian farmers whose businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, his few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling.
Silos and ports across Ukraine are brimming with more than 20 million metric tonnes of grain and corn that has nowhere to go, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast and the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain.
Ukraine used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia invaded the country, it has been forced to export by train or via its small Danube River ports. As a result, global wheat prices leaped by 20% in March, owing to the direct impact of the war on wheat production, with the world facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition, at a time when 42 million people were already one step away from famine.
David Beasley, the executive director of the UN World Food Programme, which feeds 125 million people and buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, appealed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin: “If you have any heart at all, please open these ports.”
“This is not just about Ukraine,” Beasley said last week. “This is about the poorest of the poor who are on the brink of starvation as we speak.”
“The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” says Mishchenko. “We already have problems, because even those farmers who managed to sow their fields, they simply don’t have enough fuel to harvest. Another problem – fertilisers; we used to import them from Russia and Belarus, not enough fertiliser means you harvest 20-30% less.”
Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine served as one of the world’s leading breadbaskets – exporting roughly 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports, including 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn, and half of its sunflower oil.
Last year, Ukraine produced about 33m tonnes of wheat, of which it exported about 20m tonnes, making it the sixth largest exporter globally. This year, with the situation as it stands, according to the satellite analysis company Kayrros, which uses artificial intelligence combined with data from satellites to monitor commodities, the wheat harvest in the country is likely to be down by at least 35% compared with 2021.
“I don’t know how to survive,” says Mishchenko, who toured the world before the war with a Ukrainian folk choir. “The government doesn’t have the money to help us rebuild. All the money goes to the army.”
The cannon shots of both Russian and Ukrainian artillery destroyed his warehouse, the shed where he worked the grain and the house where he lived with his wife and son, Roman, 42. At least 20 of his cows were shot, the carcasses still lying inside the stables, which were also destroyed. The livestock that survived the bombings have been reduced to skin and bones after a blast incinerated tons of hay.
The war not only destroyed Mishchenko’s business. It also took his son-in-law away from him.
“He volunteered to join the army and was killed defending Marakiv.”
Like many other Ukrainian farmers, Mishchenko will have to start rebuilding everything from scratch. A few days ago, he launched a crowdfunder, and is hoping to resume his business as soon as possible.
Mishchenko was one of the first independent growers in Ukraine, after the fall of the Soviet Union. When he bought this piece of land with his wife, back in the early 1990s, all they had was a tiny trailer.
Today, the trailer is the only structure left standing after shelling, and that’s where Mishchenko and his son live today.
“Thirty years after I built all this, I am back in that trailer,” he said. “All my life – everything I have built with my own hands in these 30 years, was destroyed, in just one moment.”

Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s ministry of defence claims to have destroyed a warehouse full of ammunition in Razdolovka which was stockpiling 155mm shells manufactured for American-made M-777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine.
Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Sieverodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.
Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine and is not “chasing deadlines”. “All the goals set by the president will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise,” he said.
The Russia-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Kherson region will ask Moscow to set up a military base on its territory, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reports. Russia successfully seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in mid-March which is adjacent to Crimea, the peninsula which Moscow has controlled since 2014.
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.”
A team of Colombian soldiers will travel to Europe to train their Ukrainian counterparts on de-mining techniques, the South American country’s defence minister has said.
Finland and Sweden will send delegations to Ankara tomorrow to try to resolve Turkish opposition to their applications for membership of the Nato military alliance, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto has said.
Poland has continued to signal its intent to bolster its defences in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Defence secretary Mariusz Blaszczak said the country intends to buy six additional Patriot missile batteries.
Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, says the war on Ukraine is putting the international order into question. She said the World Economic Forum at Davos should be talking about making the world better together, but instead they must talk about Putin’s invasion, where Russia’s playbook for the war “comes out of another century”. To rebuild Ukraine, she said “We should leave no stone unturned, including possibly using the Russian assets we have frozen.”
A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies.
A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over the invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation.
A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.
Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers were due to face war crimes trials, she said, and Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes.
Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a Harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, said Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary. The new security packages included “critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”.
Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume.
“Low-level” discussions were under way on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia.
The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days”, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. Robert Habeck also told German broadcaster ZDF that the European Commission and the US were working on a proposal to cap global oil prices rather than pay “any price”.
Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.
Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far.
The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face.
The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly.
New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain. The pictures released by Maxar Technologies seemingly back up claims from Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by.
Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business there. The Seattle-based coffee company has 130 stores and nearly 2,000 employees in Russia. McDonalds is also pulling out, removing the “golden arches” from Moscow before leaving for good."

In recent years, as Viktor Orbán has consolidated his hold over Hungary’s body politic, he has acquired a cult following on America’s Republican right. That status was confirmed last week when US conservatives staged a special conference in Budapest, the centrepiece of which was an address by the newly re-elected prime minister. Speaking to the conference theme of “God, homeland, family”, the self-styled standard bearer for “illiberal democracy” did not hold back. Delegates were told that “ideologically trained bureaucrats” in Washington and Brussels – in cahoots with progressive liberals and “neo-Marxists” – were seeking to undermine traditional western values. Mr Orbán then outlined the strategy taken in Hungary to eradicate this threat. “The first point in the Hungarian formula,” he said, “is to play by our own rules.”
In that spirit, Mr Orbán’s Hungary has flouted the democratic norms of European Union membership for years. On issues relating to corruption, the independence of the media, asylum and LGBTQ+ rights, Budapest has flatly ignored EU objections to its actions. Mr Orbán has made domestic political capital from waging a culture war against Brussels, even as Hungary accessed billions of pounds worth of EU regional aid. As he trolls the EU ever more brazenly from within and gives masterclasses to America’s “alt-right”, what can Brussels do about it?
Up to now, despite a plethora of legal manoeuvres, the answer to that question has been not much. In 2018, the European parliament voted to pursue disciplinary action against Hungary under article 7 of the EU treaty, which is designed to protect the union’s fundamental values. But despite another Brussels hearing on the subject on Monday,matters have proceeded at a snail’s pace. Last month, the European Commission accused Hungary of “continuous breaches” of anti-corruption rules, triggering a formal process that could lead to the withholding of funds. But though the move was acclaimed by MEPs, this is likely to be a similarly drawn-out process.
The war in Ukraine has now complicated matters, giving Mr Orbán new leverage as the EU seeks to present a united front against Vladimir Putin. Hungary is the only member state refusing to sign up to a ban on Russian oil imports, despite concessions allowing it until 2024 to organise alternatives. Any eventual agreement is likely to come at a high price financially, in terms of assistance, and politically. As Lithuania’s foreign minister put it last week, “the whole union is being held hostage by one member state”.
For now, as the EU seeks to unite in the face of urgent geopolitical threats, it may have to put up with Mr Orbán’s efforts to undermine it from within. But a reckoning must surely come with a leader who holds its rules – and the values that inform them – in contempt. In theory, the article 7 process could lead to the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the EU. Almost certainly, there is neither the bandwidth nor the appetite in Brussels to go down that route, given current circumstances. But joining a club means playing by its rules, rather than your own. Sooner or later, there must be meaningful consequences for not doing so."

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the war in Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy and could result in recession for more vulnerable countries.
Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly.
Asked in a session on the world economy at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether the IMF was forecasting a global recession, Georgieva replied: “Not at this point. It doesn’t mean one is out of the question.”
The IMF managing director said her organisation had recently downgraded the growth prospects for 143 of its member states, which represent 80% of global output.
“Since then the horizon has darkened,” she said, pointing out that the impact of the war in Ukraine was being amplified by a tightening of financial conditions, a rising US dollar and a slowdown in China. “2022 is going to be a tough year.”
Along with other Davos attenders, the IMF head highlighted the risks of rising food prices. Georgieva said there had been a sense over the past week that the global economy was getting into rougher waters. The oil price had come down but “food prices continue to go up, up, up, up”.
She said: “We can shrink the use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day. The anxiety about access to food at a reasonable price, globally, is hitting the roof.”
The IMF is now predicting global growth of 3.6% this year, and Georgieva said it was a long way from turning negative. “What we may see is recession in some countries that are weak to begin with. They haven’t recovered from the Covid crisis. They’re highly dependent on imports from Russia, of energy or food, and they have a somewhat weaker environment already.”
Jane Fraser, the chief executive of the US investment bank Citigroup, told the same Davos panel that Europe looked particularly vulnerable. “Europe is right in the middle of the storms from supply chains, from the energy crisis, and obviously just the proximity to some of the atrocities that are occurring in Ukraine,” she said."

A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment.
Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.”
“Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,” wrote the diplomat, a 20-year veteran of the Russian foreign ministry. “It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.”
Bondarev is the highest-level diplomat yet to resign publicly from the Russian foreign ministry over the war, which began in February. In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Bondarev confirmed that he had written the statement and submitted his letter of resignation on Monday.
“The decision was very simple,” said Bondarev. “When you see that your country is doing the worst things and being a civil servant you’re somehow related to that, it’s your decision just to terminate your connection with the government. We all must be responsible. And I don’t want to have any responsibility for what I don’t approve of.”
Bondarev published the statement on his Facebook and LinkedIn accounts and also sent copies to diplomats and media outlets. He said he had walked into work on Monday, submitted his resignation, and walked out.
“The decision was made on February 24. But it took some time to gather some resolve to make it,” he said.
Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Geneva-based human rights organisation UN Watch, called Bondarev a “hero”.
“We are now calling on all other Russian diplomats at the United Nations – and worldwide – to follow his moral example and resign,” he said.
Neuer also called for Bondarev to be allowed to speak at this week’s Davos forum, a gathering of the world’s political and business elite at a mountain resort in Switzerland.
Bondarev’s statement was also confirmed by the Russian media outlet Kommersant, which said that it “also knows the names of several other diplomats who resigned from the Russian foreign ministry after the start of the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine, but almost none of them have made public statements about this”.
Bondarev, a counsellor on arms control at the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva, said that other Russian diplomats have similar feelings about the war but are unlikely to speak out.
“There are people who think the way that I think and see the situation for what it is,” he said. “But I don’t know whether some of them will follow my example. I don’t think that there will be many.”
He said he had not had any response yet from the foreign ministry after delivering his letter of resignation on Monday.
“I don’t know what the [Russian] reaction will be,” he said. “I don’t know what I am going to do either. No plans.”
Asked whether he had asked for asylum outside Russia, he said: “I think that if someone offers to help in this difficult situation, I think it would be very gratefully accepted.”
As to returning to Russia, he said that “would not be a very good idea right now”.
In his public statement, Bondarev took aim at top officials such as Vladimir Putin and Sergei Lavrov, calling the Russian foreign minister “a good illustration of the degradation of the system”.
“The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country,” he wrote.
“Those who conceived this war want only one thing – to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity,” he said. “To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.”
Bondarev is a career diplomat who has worked for the foreign ministry since 2002. He has served as an adviser on nuclear non-proliferation for nearly a decade, first in Moscow and then at Russia’s permanent mission to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva.
During that time, he said, he had stayed on as a diplomat even as relations deteriorated with the west because he felt there was “some room for diplomacy, some room to go back to normal somehow”.
“But now after February 24, we just jumped into an abyss and there can be no going back to normal, no going back to anywhere,” he continued. “Today of course we can see that there can be no negotiations, it’s just all-out war.”"

Ukraine’s president has given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day.
While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.
The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas.

“Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday evening.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region and that Severodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions”, though Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
The Donbas has been the scene of recent heavy fighting involving intense shelling by both sides, with Zelenskiy’s remarks appearing to be a reference to fatalities in combat. The high recent death toll on the Ukrainian side also suggests an even larger number of non-fatal casualties.
Historically a ratio of one killed in action to three wounded was regarded as a rough rule of thumb for assessing casualties, although better field medical treatment and evacuation, not least for US forces in theatres such as Afghanistan and Iraq, resulted in a far higher survival rate from injuries that would once have caused deaths.
According to a policy briefing paper published by the Belfer Center in 2014: “The ratio of wounded to killed in battle has increased dramatically as a result of improvements in medical care in conflict zones. This shift is particularly relevant for technologically advanced countries such as the United States, which invest significant resources in military medicine.”
The new estimate came as Kyiv also revealed its worst military losses from a single attack of the Ukraine war on Monday, saying 87 people had been killed last week when Russian forces struck a barracks housing troops at a training base in the north.
The disclosure that scores had been killed in the attack demonstrated Russia’s ability to inflict huge losses, even far from the front. Previously, Kyiv had said eight people died in the 17 May strike on the barracks in the town of Desna.
“Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna, under the rubble, there were 87 casualties. Eighty-seven corpses,” Zelenskiy said during a speech made by video link to business leaders in Davos, Switzerland.
Moscow had said at the time that it hit a training base with long-range missiles. The toll Zelenskiy announced on Monday was more than double the number killed in a similar attack on a Ukrainian training base in Yaraviv in the west in March.
The updated death toll from Desna emerged following recent remarks by senior Ukrainian officials, including the president, that warned of increasing bloodshed in the next phase of the conflict, amid anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive later in the summer.
Zelenskiy’s acknowledgment of the increasingly heavy toll on Ukraine’s military follows claims by the UK’s Ministry of Defence that since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has probably suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan, although those claims could not be independently verified.
Like Ukraine, western allies including the UK have tended to emphasise Russian losses while avoiding the issue of Ukrainian losses as part of the information war with Moscow that appears in part aimed at trying to shift Russian public opinion against Putin’s invasion.
A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach that is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high Russian casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released on Monday morning.
Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. “The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.”"

Germany is to relax visa requirements for skilled workers from Russia, just as the country’s domestic intelligence agency warned of a heightened risk that Russian nationals working for German firms could be recruited for industrial espionage.
The chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is streamlining the visa application process by exempting Russian workers with specialised expertise in areas such as IT and communication technology from case-by-case assessments through the federal employment department.
The so-called “global approval for access to the labour market”, which applies only to Russian employees of German companies who are earning at least €43,992 a year, will last until 30 September.
Between the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of May, Germany issued more than 600 visas for Russian skilled workers, which allow for a longer stay in Germany than the 90-day so-called Schengen visa.
The German foreign office told the news agency dpa it had issued about 350 work visas via its Moscow embassy in April, in addition to a further 190 working visas issued by the general consulate in St Petersburg. Most of those in receipt of such visas were already working for German firms, dpa said.
Germany is already home to about 235,000 Russian passport holders, more than any other country in the European Union.
Only last week, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution issued a special warning that Russian nationals who were about to move to Germany, and those already working in the country, faced an increased risk of being blackmailed or otherwise put under pressure to collect information of use to a Russian economy increasingly cut off from global knowledge networks.
“Russia is increasingly isolated through the sanctions imposed in reaction to the war in Ukraine”, the report said. “Its economy is cut off from the knowhow and technologies of the west.”
Recruitment attempts could take place during mandatory appointments with Russian embassies or other bureaucratic bodies, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said. “They may also try to exercise pressure via reprisals against relatives or acquaintances who have remained in Russia”, the report continued. “In general, Russian intelligence services do not shy away from methods like threats and blackmail.”
Asked if the German government was introducing special measures to vet Russian working visa applicants, a spokesperson said: “Standard security checks of applicants are being made within the visa process.”
The decision to ease entry for Russian skilled workers comes as human rights NGOs said the German government was not doing enough to ease the visa application process for independent journalists facing repression in Russia.
About 70 Russian journalists and media professionals, most of them employees of the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd and the news website Meduza, have been put on a humanitarian visa list drawn up by the German culture ministry but do not yet qualify for the more generous visas for skilled workers.
“We want to offer Russian journalists who are being persecuted in Russia protection in Germany,” a spokesperson for the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said on Monday. “We want to ease entry and speed up processes.”"

Britain has backed in principle a proposal by Lithuania for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports.
The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London.
“Time is very very short. We are closing in on a new harvest and there is no other practical way of exporting the grain except through the Black Sea port of Odesa,” he told the Guardian. “There is no way of storing this grain and no other adequate alternative route. It is imperative that we show vulnerable countries we are prepared to take the steps that are needed to feed the world.”
Landsbergis proposed that a naval escort operation – not run by Nato – could protect the grain ships as they headed through the Black Sea and past Russian warships. He suggested that, apart from Britain, countries that were affected by the potential loss of grain such as Egypt could provide the necessary protection.
“What we have seen now is just the beginning. The worst is yet to come in the next five to seven weeks when the first harvest arrives and there is no place to put it, so that means people in northern Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia will be paying exorbitant prices for wheat, corn and the other commodities they need to put food on their table”. He said Ukraine needed to export 80m tonnes of wheat alone this year and the only option was through Odesa,.

His plan, under gestation for weeks, would require demining parts of the Black Sea to ensure safe passage, as well as the agreement of Turkey, which guards the entrance to the Black Sea.
“This would be a non-military humanitarian mission and is not comparable with a no-fly zone,” he said. “In this endeavour military ships or planes or both would be used to ensure that the grain supplies can leave Odesa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference. We would need a coalition of the willing – countries with significant naval power to protect the shipping lanes, and countries that are affected by this”.
Nato as an alliance should not take a role, he said.
After meeting Landsbergis, Truss said the UK would want British naval ships to join the escort if the practicalities could be sorted, including demining the harbour and providing Ukraine with longer-range weapons to defend the harbour from Russian attack. The UK is in discussions with allies about the plan and it would probably need US agreement to be activated.
Truss said: “What we need to do is deal with this global food security issue and the UK is working on an urgent solution to get the grain out of Ukraine”.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned of “a hurricane of hunger” if Ukrainian grain is not exported. The world’s 41 least-developed nations import a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Soaring food prices have already driven inflation levels in Egypt to the highest level since mid-2019.
Asked how Britain had reacted to his plan, Landsbergis said: “From my perspective the British government is interested in assisting Ukraine in any way it can. The UK has taken some very strong and decisive steps in this crisis and maybe there is a chance that the UK will participate. Britain was the first country to provide rockets to shield Odesa”.
He said Lithuania, one of Ukraine’s closest allies in the west, had been looking into how Ukraine would feed the world for weeks.
Landsbergis said alternative routes by rail through Belarus or by road to the Baltic Sea ports in Poland and Lithuania had severe practical drawbacks, while bottlenecks and complete overload would mean it would take Ukrainian trucks five to nine weeks to reach ports by road either in Romania, Poland or Lithuania.
Turkey, Landsbergis acknowledged, had its doubts about the escalation potential inherent in his scheme. However, he pointed out that as a major importer of grain, Turkey had a self-interest in the naval lanes being opened up if Russia would not voluntarily lift the blockade.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world.
In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum (WEF), Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia.
Ukraine’s president called for the implementation of “maximum sanctions” against Vladimir Putin’s regime and said there would be no point to Davos if Russian aggression was allowed to prevail.
Noting that history was at a turning point, Zelenskiy said: “This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world.”
Zelenskiy received a standing ovation and concluded his 45-minute session at the WEF by sending out a collective message to business leaders, telling them they should “wake up each morning with the feeling ‘what have I done for Ukraine today?’”.
Russia’s absence from this year’s Davos gathering has provided Ukraine with an opportunity to make its case for a stepping up of the west’s economic war against Russia, with Zelenskiy’s team of ministers at the WEF all urging tougher action.
Earlier Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, called for secondary sanctions against companies that continued to do business in Russia. “Now is not the time for a cost benefit analysis. We have to cut Russia off from the global economy completely,” Svyrydenko said.
Citing the example of the Munich agreement in 1938, Zelenskiy called for the withdrawal of all foreign companies from Russia so they were not used in the “bloody interests” of the Kremlin.
He said any company quitting Russia was welcome to move to Ukraine, where they could help with the massive task of repairing the colossal damage to an economy expected to shrink by at least 30% this year.
“We offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour,” he said. “I invite you to take part in this rebuilding.”
Zelenskiy said he was looking at alternative ways of getting Ukraine’s food out of the country after accusing Russia of stealing grain supplies ready for export. Talks are under way with Poland to see if food could be shipped out of ports on the Baltic Sea.
He added a corridor should be established for exports such as wheat and sunflower oil, to prevent a food crisis for countries in Africa and Asia.
Sir Lawrence Freedman, the emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said he agreed about the urgent need for international agreement to secure a good corridor because the blockading of Ukraine’s food was “looming large now”.
Freedman added: “The Ukraine line is there’s no time to waste. Just hit hard, hit now, and we need all the support we can get. And don’t nod in the direction of the Russians, they’ve got nothing to give you.”"

A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine.
Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.
The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge Serhii Ahafonov in a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small chamber.
The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he did not mean to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. “The murder was committed with direct intent,” he said.
Shishimarin, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, listened to the judge deliver his long verdict with his head bowed from inside the glass box for defendants. He was given a translation of the judge’s words from Ukrainian to Russian by a court-appointed translator.
Shishimarin was commanding a tank division from the Moscow region that came under attack on 28 February, prosecutors said. The attack led the Russian soldiers to disperse and Shishimarin ended up stealing a car with four other soldiers.
When they saw Shelipov riding a bicycle and speaking on his mobile phone, one of the other soldiers told Shishimarin to shoot him, for fear he would give away their positions. Shishimarin fired three or four shots at Shelipov from his Kalashnikov.
“I was ordered to shoot, so I opened fire on him and he fell. We carried on driving,” he said in a video interrogation released by Ukraine’s SBU security services.
Shishimarin pleaded guilty to the crime, but his lawyer argued that his client was following an order and did not have intent to kill. Shishimarin also apologised to the wife of the victim.
“The court cannot recognise the sincerity of his repentance,” Ahafonov said in his verdict.
Shishimarin was whisked away from the court after the hearing in the back of a police van. He has 30 days to launch an appeal.
Speaking outside the courthouse, Shishimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov said he would challenge the verdict. “This is the most severe sentence and any level-headed person would challenge it,” he said. He added that he believed “societal pressure” had influenced the court’s decision.
The prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the ruling was “lawful and justified”.
It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases related to war crimes that could come to trial soon, and Ukrainian authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes across the country.
Trying cases so quickly, while the conflict rages on, is extremely unusual and may violate elements of the Geneva conventions, legal experts say. However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit.
In an interview with the Russian independent news outlet Meduza, Shishimarin’s mother, Lyubov, claimed her son was a caring and kind young man who had joined the army partly because there was a lack of opportunity in their home town, and partly to help support the family after his stepfather was killed last year.
She said her son called in late February and said: “Mummy, I won’t have a telephone for a week, I have to give it up. If someone tells you I went to Ukraine, don’t believe them.” The next she heard of him was when she found out he was a prisoner in Ukraine, she said.
Shelipov’s widow, Katerina, identified Shishimarin as the man who shot her husband during a court hearing last week, and told the court she hoped he would receive a life sentence. “But if he is traded for our defenders of Azovstal, I would not mind,” she said.
There has been some speculation that once convicted, Shishmarin and others may be used as part of an exchange for Ukrainians held by Russia, including the more than 2,000 defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol who recently surrendered to the Russians.
Russian officials have veered between calling for harsh punishments, including even the death penalty, for some of the fighters, and suggesting they may be open to an exchange.
On Monday Denis Pushilin, the leader of Russia-backed Donetsk separatists, said there should be an “international tribunal” for the Azovstal defenders, many of whom have been called “Nazis” by Russian authorities.
“If an enemy [soldier] has laid down his arms, his future fate is decided by a court, if he is a Nazi criminal, this will be a tribunal,” Pushilin said.
The Kremlin said on Monday it was following the Shishimarin case. “Of course we are worried about the fate of our citizen. Unfortunately we have no possibilities to defend his interests there,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday. He said the Kremlin would use “other channels” to assist Shishimarin."

In recent weeks, the western public has been obsessed with the question “What goes on in Putin’s mind?” Western pundits wonder: do the people around him tell him the whole truth? Is he ill or going insane? Are we pushing him into a corner where he will see no other way out to save face than to accelerate the conflict into a total war?
We should stop this obsession with the red line, this endless search for the right balance between support for Ukraine and avoiding total war. The “red line” is not an objective fact: Putin himself is redrawing it all the time, and we contribute to his redrawing with our reactions to Russia’s activities. A question like “Did US intelligence-sharing with Ukraine cross a line?” makes us obliterate the basic fact: it was Russia itself which crossed the line, by attacking Ukraine. So instead of perceiving ourselves as a group which just reacts to Putin as an impenetrable evil genius, we should turn the gaze back at ourselves: what do we – the “free west” – want in this affair?
We must analyze the ambiguity of our support of Ukraine with the same cruelty we analyze Russia’s stance. We should reach beyond double standards applied today to the very foundations of European liberalism. Remember how, in the western liberal tradition, colonization was often justified in the terms of the rights of working people. John Locke, the great Enlightenment philosopher and advocate of human rights, justified white settlers grabbing land from Native Americans with a strange left-sounding argument against excessive private property. His premise was that an individual should be allowed to own only as much land as he is able to use productively, not large tracts of land that he is not able to use (and then eventually rents to others). In North America, as he saw it, Indigenous people were using vast tracts of land mostly just for hunting, and the white settlers who wanted to use it for intense agriculture had the right to seize it for the benefit of humanity.
In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, both sides present their acts as something they simply had to do: the west had to help Ukraine remain free and independent; Russia was compelled to intervene militarily to protect its safety. The latest example: the Russian foreign ministry claiming Russia will be “forced to take retaliatory steps” if Finland joins Nato. No, it will not be “forced”, in the same way that Russia was not “forced” to attack Ukraine. This decision appears “forced” only if one accepts the whole set of ideological and geopolitical assumptions that sustain Russian politics.
These assumptions have to be analyzed closely, without any taboos. One often hears that we should draw a strict line of separation between Putin’s politics and the great Russian culture, but this line of separation is much more porous than it may appear. We should resolutely reject the idea that, after years of patiently trying to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations, Russia was finally forced/compelled to attack Ukraine – one is never forced to attack and annihilate a whole country. The roots are much deeper; I am ready to call them properly metaphysical.
Anatoly Chubais, the father of Russian oligarchs (he orchestrated Russia’s rapid privatization in 1992), said in 2004: “I’ve reread all of Dostoevsky over the past three months. And I feel nothing but almost physical hatred for the man. He is certainly a genius, but his idea of Russians as special, holy people, his cult of suffering and the false choices he presents make me want to tear him to pieces.” As much as I dislike Chubais for his politics, I think he is right about Dostoevsky, who provided the “deepest” expression of the opposition between Europe and Russia: individualism versus collective spirit, materialist hedonism versus the spirit of sacrifice.
Russia now presents its invasion as a new step in the fight for decolonization, against western globalization. In a text published earlier this month, Dmitry Medvedev, the ex-president of Russia and now the deputy secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, wrote that “the world is waiting for the collapse of the idea of an American-centric world and the emergence of new international alliances based on pragmatic criteria.” (“Pragmatic criteria” means disregard for universal human rights, of course.)
So we should also draw red lines, but in a way which makes clear our solidarity with developing countries. Medvedev predicts that, because of the war in Ukraine, “in some states, hunger may occur due to the food crisis” – a statement of breathtaking cynicism. As of May 2022, about 25m metric tons of grain are slowly rotting in Odesa, on ships or in silos, since the port is blocked by the Russian navy. “The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that millions of people are ‘marching towards starvation’ unless ports in southern Ukraine which have been closed because of the war, are reopened,” Newsweek reports. Europe now promises to help Ukraine transport the grain by railway and truck – but this is clearly not enough. A step more is needed: a clear demand to open the port for the export of grain, inclusive of sending protective military ships there. It’s not about Ukraine, it’s about the hunger of hundreds of millions in Africa and Asia. Here should the red line be drawn.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently said: “Imagine [the Ukraine war] is happening in Africa, or the Middle East. Imagine Ukraine is Palestine. Imagine Russia is the United States.” As expected, comparing the conflict in Ukraine with the plight of the Palestinians “offended many Israelis, who believe there are no similarities”, Newsweek noted. “For example, many point out that Ukraine is a sovereign, democratic country, but don’t consider Palestine as a state.” Of course Palestine is not a state because Israel denies its right to be a state – in the same way Russia denies the right of Ukraine to be a sovereign state. As much as I find Lavrov’s remarks repulsive, he sometimes deftly manipulates the truth.
Yes, the liberal west is hypocritical, applying its high standards very selectively. But hypocrisy means you violate the standards you proclaim, and in this way you open yourself up to inherent criticism – when we criticize the liberal west, we use its own standards. What Russia is offering is a world without hypocrisy – because it is without global ethical standards, practicing just pragmatic “respect” for differences. We have seen clearly what this means when, after the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, they instantly made a deal with China. China accepts the new Afghanistan while the Taliban will ignore what China is doing to Uyghurs – this is, in nuce, the new globalization advocated by Russia. And the only way to defend what is worth saving in our liberal tradition is to ruthlessly insist on its universality. The moment we apply double standards, we are no less “pragmatic” than Russia.

No, it will not be “forced”, in the same way that Russia was not “forced” to attack Ukraine. This decision appears “forced” only if one accepts the whole set of ideological and geopolitical assumptions that sustain Russian politics.
These assumptions have to be analyzed closely, without any taboos. One often hears that we should draw a strict line of separation between Putin’s politics and the great Russian culture, but this line of separation is much more porous than it may appear. We should resolutely reject the idea that, after years of patiently trying to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations, Russia was finally forced/compelled to attack Ukraine – one is never forced to attack and annihilate a whole country. The roots are much deeper; I am ready to call them properly metaphysical.
Anatoly Chubais, the father of Russian oligarchs (he orchestrated Russia’s rapid privatization in 1992), said in 2004: “I’ve reread all of Dostoevsky over the past three months. And I feel nothing but almost physical hatred for the man. He is certainly a genius, but his idea of Russians as special, holy people, his cult of suffering and the false choices he presents make me want to tear him to pieces.” As much as I dislike Chubais for his politics, I think he is right about Dostoevsky, who provided the “deepest” expression of the opposition between Europe and Russia: individualism versus collective spirit, materialist hedonism versus the spirit of sacrifice.
Russia now presents its invasion as a new step in the fight for decolonization, against western globalization. In a text published earlier this month, Dmitry Medvedev, the ex-president of Russia and now the deputy secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, wrote that “the world is waiting for the collapse of the idea of an American-centric world and the emergence of new international alliances based on pragmatic criteria.” (“Pragmatic criteria” means disregard for universal human rights, of course.)
So we should also draw red lines, but in a way which makes clear our solidarity with developing countries. Medvedev predicts that, because of the war in Ukraine, “in some states, hunger may occur due to the food crisis” – a statement of breathtaking cynicism. As of May 2022, about 25m metric tons of grain are slowly rotting in Odesa, on ships or in silos, since the port is blocked by the Russian navy. “The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that millions of people are ‘marching towards starvation’ unless ports in southern Ukraine which have been closed because of the war, are reopened,” Newsweek reports. Europe now promises to help Ukraine transport the grain by railway and truck – but this is clearly not enough. A step more is needed: a clear demand to open the port for the export of grain, inclusive of sending protective military ships there. It’s not about Ukraine, it’s about the hunger of hundreds of millions in Africa and Asia. Here should the red line be drawn.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently said: “Imagine [the Ukraine war] is happening in Africa, or the Middle East. Imagine Ukraine is Palestine. Imagine Russia is the United States.” As expected, comparing the conflict in Ukraine with the plight of the Palestinians “offended many Israelis, who believe there are no similarities”, Newsweek noted. “For example, many point out that Ukraine is a sovereign, democratic country, but don’t consider Palestine as a state.” Of course Palestine is not a state because Israel denies its right to be a state – in the same way Russia denies the right of Ukraine to be a sovereign state. As much as I find Lavrov’s remarks repulsive, he sometimes deftly manipulates the truth.
Yes, the liberal west is hypocritical, applying its high standards very selectively. But hypocrisy means you violate the standards you proclaim, and in this way you open yourself up to inherent criticism – when we criticize the liberal west, we use its own standards. What Russia is offering is a world without hypocrisy – because it is without global ethical standards, practicing just pragmatic “respect” for differences. We have seen clearly what this means when, after the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, they instantly made a deal with China. China accepts the new Afghanistan while the Taliban will ignore what China is doing to Uyghurs – this is, in nuce, the new globalization advocated by Russia. And the only way to defend what is worth saving in our liberal tradition is to ruthlessly insist on its universality. The moment we apply double standards, we are no less “pragmatic” than Russia.

The image of a windswept young woman holding tight to the leads of nine dogs under an ominously dark sky spread far and wide at the time of the Battle of Kyiv.
The apparent bravery of the woman, who was attempting an audacious evacuation across a broken bridge targeted by Russian fire, and the vulnerability of the animals, some of whom were strapped into dog wheelchairs, epitomised to many the cruelty of the war being waged by Vladimir Putin and the dignity of the Ukrainian response.
The full story of the trials of Anastasiya Tykha, 20, a veterinary student in the final year of her degree, and her husband Arthur Lee, 26, is perhaps even more striking than the photograph, which the couple discovered had gone viral when Tykha saw herself on the television news and listened to the presenter report that she was dead.
Speaking in Irpin, the town 13 miles north of Kyiv from where the couple had fled on 9 March, Tykha said they ended up making seven crossings of the bridge in total, each one under fire.
“We had too much to do to be worried or scared”, said Tykha, who has run an animal shelter in Irpin for four years, and who on that first journey was seeking to escape with 19 dogs, five cats, a turtle, a chameleon, two Triton lizards, an axolotl and a hamster.
It was not an easy decision to flee, but the Russians had wrestled control of the town, there was no electricity or running water and the dogs were having to drink from the shelter’s aquarium.
It was Snizhana Bugryk, 35, a friend who was involved in finding abandoned and disabled animals for Tykha and Lee’s shelter, who persuaded the couple that they had no choice but to leave.
“Snizhana said we had to go or we would be killed, that this was our last chance for us and the animals to survive,” said Tykha. “And she was right”, added Lee. “Our house was later in the heart of the heavy fighting.”
It was a two-mile walk to the bridge where Ukrainian soldiers were helping people across.
Two of the dogs – Strong and Baileys, mongrel border collies with broken spines – were in wheelchairs, while Life, a four-year-old with amputated legs, had refused to be strapped in and was dragging herself on her stumps. “I did think at one point that we would not make it,” said Lee, “but Snizhana called and said there would be a minibus on the other side to help”.
It took three hours to get to the bridge. One dog, Pandora, a one-and-a-half-year-old mongrel Belgian shepherd, was so terrified that he bit off part of his tongue, while four of the others, including the couple’s own dog, Zeus, a beagle, became so worked up by the sounds of war they chewed through their leads and ran away.
Arriving exhausted at the Ukrainian checkpoint by the bridge, the couple and their animals drew the attention of press photographers, who crowded around them.
“That was when that photo was taken – I just wanted them to let us get through to the bridge,” said Tykha. “I was worried because there were burned out cars and lots of smashed glass and metal, and I didn’t want the animals to be cut up.”
A group of Ukrainian soldiers came to their aid, ushering the photographers away. “There were explosions and shooting but after two weeks of Russian occupation, we were used to it,” Lee said.
The couple found the minivan and it took them to a south-western district of Kyiv, where a sauna on the side of a house had been made available to them and their animals to stay in.
It was the next day that the couple discovered that their adventures were being talked about across Ukraine, and that Tykha was presumed dead.
They were determined to go back to find Zeus and the other dogs who had fled in fear.
“We were in the sauna for five days, but every one of those days Anastasiya went to the Ukrainian military checkpoint and demanded that she be allowed through to get the escaped dogs,” said Lee. Every day the commander at the checkpoint refused, and every day she came back. He was finally browbeaten into submission.
After crossing the bridge, again under fire, they faced a three-mile walk to a an abandoned animal shelter, where they knew there were hungry dogs who needed help.
“It was a hard walk because we had all this heavy food,” said Lee. They returned to their own home, where they found Zeus, and picked up some neighbours’ dogs, including a German shepherd, bringing their party of animals for the return to five.
They would make two further trips, and all the dogs that fled on the first escape were accounted for.
Lee said their final trip back to Irpin, on 29 March, was the scariest. “The council had said that the Russians had gone the previous day and that it was safe – but it wasn’t,” Lee said. “The bombs were landing just 2 metres from us. We hid between the minivan and a fence, but it was close.”
Now they are back in Irpin in a new, rented house. Because so many former residents have left, their collection of sheltered animals has grown to 30 dogs and 10 cats. They are, the couple say, just happy to be living the life they love."

Good morning. When the war in Ukraine first began, the fall of Kyiv, and the Ukrainian state more broadly, seemed highly likely. Almost three months on, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. Russia has suffered a series of significant military setbacks that make any victory for them look a much more distant and difficult prospect – but a swift win for Ukraine doesn’t look likely either.
As the war begins to enter a protracted phase, and with decisive developments on the ground becoming rarer and harder to read, I spoke to some experts about how the war in Ukraine might develop. First, though, the headlines – and a programming note: from today, we’ll be adding the Guardian’s crosswords to the First Edition mix. You’ll find links to them at the bottom of the email.
Ukraine | Ukraine’s primary negotiator in peace talks, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said that there will not be a ceasefire deal with Russia if it involves ceding any territory to Russia.

Australia | Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has been sworn in as the country’s 31st prime minister in Canberra.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the discussion on how and when the conflict would end has been at the top of the agenda. Here are four scenarios for an end to the violence:
Ukraine wins
A Ukrainian victory means different things to different people. To some it is pushing Russia back to the territories it controlled before the start of the invasion; for others it’s about pushing it back to the pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed Crimea.
Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum and the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, told me that a real victory for Ukraine is one where the country is in a more secure position than it was before the war began. This is the second Russian-Ukrainian war in the last decade, she notes, and a meaningful victory should stop a third war from ever happening. Practically speaking, in the short term, Orysia says, “Ukraine will have to push Russia out of as much territory as possible, including the occupation in the south and in Donbas”.
But there is a larger issue. “A Ukrainian victory means that Putin’s doctrine and Russian revanchism is contained [in Russia] and, eventually, put an end to completely,” Orysia says. Anything else is an “interim solution” (which isn’t to be discounted if it could stop the immediate effects of war). But to claim any real long term resolution, she adds, the underlying problems that caused the war must be addressed and dealt with. And, perhaps most importantly, Orysia argues, the mistakes of 2015 cannot be repeated: “Ukraine was pushed into concessions and a ceasefire agreement that, in the end, only gave Putin an upper hand to prepare for a bigger war.”
Russia wins
A Russian victory is more difficult to imagine for a number of reasons. I spoke to senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison, who has been covering the war on the ground, about what it might look like. “First of all, it’s important to differentiate between whether the whole world is saying Russia won or if Putin decides to declare victory himself – because those are potentially two quite different things,” she says. Another reason why it’s so difficult to envision what victory for Russia might look like is that the goalposts have moved so dramatically since the start of the war. “Putin’s objectives were pretty clear: to take Kyiv and install a puppet government,” Emma says. “But now that seems militarily impossible.”
Another road to victory is to simply run down the clock, with Russia working under the assumption that, even if the west keeps supplying Ukraine with arms, Kyiv’s army might run out of military personnel. Or, as time wears on, the war may just fall down the agenda in western countries, and resources and capital may slowly stop flowing in. This could lead to a situation where Ukraine capitulates, but this would take years. A victory in this scenario would look like mass loss of life, much of Ukraine levelled, and economic devastation for both countries.
A negotiated settlement
One way the war could end, is the way that many wars in history have ended – some kind of peace deal. Dr Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London, sees such a settlement as difficult to achieve. Russia’s initial demands from Ukraine were unworkable, he argues: “Demilitarisation is not likely to happen and ‘de-nazification’, whatever that means in the Ukrainian context, is a mythological problem, so it doesn’t really have anything other than a mythological solution.” These things cannot be negotiated, partly because they’re non-negotiables from the Ukrainian perspective, but also because some of the problems are entirely within the heads of the Russian government, Greene says.
The other sticking point is that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is an elected representative of the Ukrainian people – any settlement has to be mandated by them too. “They would not support a negotiated solution that would cede control of Ukrainian territory on a permanent basis,” Greene adds.
So a negotiated settlement would have to mean that Russia would move away from some of its stated aims and Ukraine would have to move to some kind of neutrality status (this means that, under international law, Ukraine won’t interfere in armed conflict involving other belligerent parties – and crucially it cannot allow a belligerent party to use their country in any kind of militaristic capacity).
The most important question in all of this, Greene says, is what the west’s response will be because their priority is keeping Russia isolated at least to some degree to stop them from waging further war. “The more you keep Russia isolated the harder it is for them to reinvest in their military,” he says. “So sanctions actually do become a tool of military engagement.” But in the context of a settlement, the international community would need to prioritise peace, not maximum humiliation for Russia.
A ceasefire
The most likely end to the violence will not be an end to the war at all, but a ceasefire, says Greene. “Zelenskiy has been clear about his willingness to talk to the Russians, if the Russians are willing to talk openly and honestly about some kind of a ceasefire arrangement that will stop people from dying.” It’s the quickest and most effective way to curb the continued violence without anyone having to admit defeat, and a process the Ukrainian president restated his willingness to embark upon over the weekend.
While the relief of a ceasefire would be welcome, it could have unwelcome consequences, too. As in the years after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a prolonged stalemate could just give space and capacity for Russia to re-strategise and reinvest in its military – which could ultimately lead to an even lengthier war.

The warning about rising energy bills from Michael Lewis, the boss of E.ON, is the lead in several papers this morning. The headline on the Times splash is “Fuel poverty predicted to hit 40% of households” whereas the Mirror says: “Energy boss: prices are too high”. The Express splash headline takes a figure from Lewis’s warning and leads with “Time for rescue Plan, Rishi! Energy bills to hit £3,000”, while the Daily Record also focuses on that big increase in costs: “Energy bills to hit £3000 a year”. The i has “Cost of living help on hold as PM focuses on Partygate”.
The Guardian reports that Boris Johnson is going to say that work is the best way to cope with rising energy bills, but its main story is another alarming statistic: “Children’s mental health in crisis as cases rocket to a record high”. The Mail leads with “PM allies accuse Sue Gray of ‘playing politics’” but the Telegraph looks further afield for its lead: “Gene-edited crops to help ease Ukraine food crisis”. The FT has “Investors challenged by demise of three-decade era of globalisation” and the Scotsman’s main story is “Minister urges workers to be ‘sensible’ over pay”.

A young woman takes a selfie in front of the burned-out carcass of a Russian armoured personnel carrier. A child eating an ice cream peers at the remains of a tank turret. A curious pensioner photographs the label on some mangled plane fuselage, which explains it belonged to a Russian Su-25, shot down by the Ukrainian military on 2 March.
Vladimir Putin doubtless envisioned a scenario in which Russian military hardware would stand on Kyiv’s central streets this spring, but he probably did not imagine it would look like this.
Here on Kriposnyi Lane, just a few minutes’ walk from the compound where Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spent the last three months evading reported Russian plans to kill him, Ukraine’s military history museum has opened a street exhibition of captured Russian hardware.
Inside the museum, there is a temporary display of souvenirs, trophies and evidence of the Russian occupation of the towns and villages around Kyiv.
“Many soldiers had been here on excursions before, so they knew where to bring things they had found,” said Oleksandr Shemelyak, a senior researcher at the museum. “All the time we are getting new items to put on display.”
Across Kyiv, at the museum of the second world war, an even larger exhibition has opened, which is named Crucified Ukraine, and also features both captured hardware outside and a vast array of items chronicling the Russian occupation around Kyiv.
The Russian army began its push towards Kyiv from the north, west and east in the first days of the war, and spent more than a month occupying areas around the capital before a chaotic withdrawal at the beginning of April, effectively an admission of failure.
“Three days after the liberation, the museum staff set off on missions to collect artefacts, accompanied by the Ukrainian military,” said Dmytro Hainetdinov, head of the museum’s education department.
Some of the exhibits look almost like artworks: more than a hundred pairs of Russian army boots, of different shapes and sizes, are arranged inside a red star. A charred church cupola hangs in the air among various other artefacts recovered from three different churches that were destroyed during the fighting. An icon with a hole in it made by shrapnel forms the centre of the display.
Other items on display include the passports, bank cards and other personal effects of Russian soldiers. There is a map of the left bank of Kyiv, with police stations and other strategic points carefully marked using coloured coding; it was allegedly seized from a Russian diversionary group operating inside the city during the first days of the war.
In the basement, the staff have recreated a shelter used by residents of the town of Hostomel, who spent more than a month below ground during the occupation. All the contents are original, from the blankets, teabags, salami and makeshift memorial plaque for a woman who died during the occupation.
The museum believes the artefacts are important to preserve for posterity, but also wants those Ukrainians who did not experience occupation to be able to see the horror for themselves. “Many people left for safer places, and are now returning, and happily, they did not have to experience these things first hand,” said Hainetdinov.
Upstairs, a television screen shows footage of Russian politicians, television hosts and ordinary citizens making derogatory statements about Ukrainians, in an attempt to show how such rhetoric can lay the groundwork for what has happened in recent months.
“This is a project that shows what happens when the lessons of history are not learned,” said Hainetdinov."

A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia’s 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing the 62-year-old man in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February after being ordered to shoot at him from a car.
Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko has said that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”.
Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last night that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region.
Donetsk’s self-proclaimed separatist leader Denis Pushilin has said that “The prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia was concerned by the trial of a Russian serviceman in Kyiv charged with war crimes, adding that it could not defend his interests in person.
Peskov also warned that Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He proposed a full oil embargo and cutting off all of Russia’s banks from the international monetary system.
Zelenskiy suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war.
Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed.
Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report.
A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine.
Belarus’s army has begun checking its weaponry and logistics equipment to make sure they are combat-ready, its ministry of defence said, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said the army was carrying out checks on equipment in long-term storage. “The inspection will determine the condition of the equipment and its readiness to carry out its tasks,” it said.
Lithuania has called for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London.
A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years”, France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying,” Clément Beaune said. “It’s probably in 15 or 20 years. It takes a long time.”
Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes.
Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since, “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her.
The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries.
Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from president Vladimir Putin’s military.
Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west.
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.
New Zealand will deploy another 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes."

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/23/total-displaced-people-now-at-staggering-milestone-of-100m-says-un;2022-05-22;Number of displaced people passes 100m for the first time, says UN;"‘Staggering milestone’ calls for urgent international action to address underlying causes of conflict, persecution and the climate crisis, says high commissioner for refugees
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the global number of forcibly displaced people has passed 100 million for the first time, describing it as a “staggering milestone”.
The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the grim new statistic should act as a wake-up call for the international community and that more action is needed internationally to address the root causes of forced displacement around the world.
Officials said that the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution had risen to an unprecedented level due to the war in Ukraine along with other deadly conflicts.
“One hundred million is a stark figure – sobering and alarming in equal measure,” said Grandi. “This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes.”
The figure hit 90 million at the end of 2021, propelled by a range of conflicts including in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nigeria.
Eight million Ukrainian people have been displaced within their home country as a result of the war, along with more than six million refugee movements registered from Ukraine.
“The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Grandi. “Compassion is alive and we need similar mobilisation for all crises around the world. But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure. To reverse this trend the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight or exile.”
The term “displaced person” was first used during the second world war, in which more than 40 million people were forcibly displaced.
A report from the House of Lords library in December 2021 cites UNHCR statistics that the number of people forcibly displaced globally exceeded 84 million by mid-2021. This was an increase from the estimated 82.4 million at the end of 2020. Armed conflicts, violence and human rights violations were leading causes. The report also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic, disasters, extreme weather, and the other effects of climate breakdown had created additional challenges for displaced people.
UNHCR reported that, by the end of June 2021, the number of refugees under its mandate had surpassed 20.8 million, an increase of 172,000 on the end of 2020. More than half of those who were granted international protection were from five countries – Central African Republic (71,800), South Sudan (61,700), Syria (38,800), Afghanistan (25,200) and Nigeria (20,300).
Syria continued to account for the world’s largest refugee population. Venezuelans were the second largest group and Afghans made up the third largest group.
The three countries hosting the most displaced people were Turkey with 3,696,800, Colombia with 1,743,900 and Uganda with 1,475,300.
On 16 June UNHCR will release its annual Global Trends report outlining a full set of global, regional and national data for 2021 along with more limited updates to April 2022."

Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region on Sunday.
“The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, in a Twitter post.
The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, offered Warsaw’s backing, telling politicians in Kyiv that the international community had to demand Russia’s complete withdrawal and that sacrificing any of Ukraine’s territory would be a “huge blow” to the west.
“Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands,” Duda said, in the first in-person address to the Ukrainian parliament by a foreign leader since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. “Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future,” he said.
On Saturday Ukraine’s lead negotiator in the stalled peace talks, Mykhailo Podolyak, said: “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty nor territories and Ukrainians living on them.”
A few hours before, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had suggested that his government was willing to resume talks with Russia as long as Moscow did not kill Ukrainian troops who had been defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
After calls for an immediate ceasefire from the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, Podolyak made clear that Ukraine would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory, and that agreeing to a ceasefire now while making concessions to Russia would backfire on Ukraine because “Moscow would hit back harder after any break in fighting”.
Meanwhile on Sunday, Russian forces continued their bombardment of frontline Ukrainian cities, waging a major offensive in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas. Moscow’s goal – having taken full control of the port city of Mariupol, in what was perhaps Moscow’s biggest capture of the nearly three-month war – is to seize the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the region and gain military momentum.
Controlling Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, with mainland Russia and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.
Shelling and missile strikes hit Kharkiv in northern Ukraine and Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, while eight civilians were killed on the eastern front in the Donbas, Ukrainian officials said.
Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s defence ministry, said Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 60 miles (100km) north-east of the city of Mykolaiv.
On the Donetsk frontline, Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defences to reach the administrative borders of the Luhansk region, while farther north they continued heavy shelling of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, according to Ukraine’s general staff.
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, its twin city on the other side of the Siverskiy Donets River, form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv and shifting its focus to the east and south of the country.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said that although Severodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions”, the Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
The Russian army has flattened the Black Sea port of Mariupol during its siege and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to relentless ground and artillery attacks.
“There is no work, no food, no water,” said Angela Kopytsa, 52, breaking into tears as she spoke to AFP reporters on a Russian-organised tour of Mariupol. Kopytsa said her home and her life had been destroyed during the fighting and that children on maternity wards were dying of hunger.

The last child in a ruined village in north-east Ukraine has been evacuated with his family from the basement in which they lived for three months after a benefactor read of their plight in the Guardian.
Tymofiy Seidov, eight, did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, owing to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova, and a second woman in the basement, Alla Lisnenko, 59.
“When we took Tymofiy out of the bomb shelter, he kept holding my hand,” Rita said. “He kept telling me ‘Mum, let’s go back inside, Mum, let’s hide, Mum, let’s not be out in the open.’”
Kutuzivka, 12 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, has been on the frontline of the war since 24 February and it was retaken from Russian forces three weeks ago, at a heavy price for those living among its ruins.
The village was bombed throughout and of the 1,500 people who had lived there only about 50 remain – most of whom had been living alongside Tymofiy in the dark, dusty cellar where the young boy spent much of his time drawing pictures of monsters, tanks and remembered beaches and happier days under the sun.
Along with Rita, his aunt Yana, 33, grandmother Lyudmyla, 57 and grandfather Mykola, 62, Tymofiy is now heading to the relative safety of western Ukraine, but the family’s final destination is Zurich in Switzerland, where more than 40,000 Ukrainian refugees have made a home since the war began.
Their future remains full of uncertainty as they look to resettle in a strange country without money or the ability to speak the local languages, yet Rita said the family had no choice but to flee the fighting.
“At first Tymofiy did not want to leave Kutuzivka,” she said. “He was very upset when we told him we were leaving. I think he is now afraid of travelling. He cried. He was afraid of artillery shelling when we were taken from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv.
“He is afraid of shelling throughout Ukraine. Alla, as a mother, and we all talked to him and convinced him that we are going to a place where nothing will shoot and where everything will be quiet.”
Rita said her son’s health had begun to wane after living for 87 days with 23 other people in the almost pitch black 40-by-five-metre basement below the ruins of two-storey kindergarten and medical centre.
“Tymofiy was examined by a doctor and diagnosed with an allergy to dust from the basement,” Rita said. “This dust from the basement walls, which Tymofiy was breathing all the time, had begun to cause an allergic reaction.”
The family’s evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help, while the Ukrainian military agreed to provide safe passage. The reader did not want to be identified but said he hoped others would donate funds to help Tymofiy and his family, and he called for a greater political effort in the west to “prevent the suffering of millions caused by the insanity of the few”.
Rita said making the decision to leave Kutuzivka had been difficult, although it was confirmed as the right move as they emerged from the basement to see the full scale of the damage wreaked on her village.
She said: “My mother cried all the time, all these days when we were packing she cried. She cried all the way from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv railway station. When we started to leave Kutuzivka we saw how our village was destroyed. We saw that Kutuzivka was in ruins.
“This was the first time we saw our village because all these days we were constantly in the basement. And when we went out and saw the scale of the destruction, I had a lump in my throat from pain and sadness. We had lived in our peaceful village for a long time and in one moment it has been destroyed. It was very painful for us to look at it.”
She went on: “My parents really didn’t want to go. They did not want to leave their home. But I convinced them. Because we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. We are afraid that tomorrow the war may return to our village. I told my parents it was safe. We will not be constantly under fire and we needed to go.”
Rita said she hoped in the future to help others to escape, and she would never forget the aid given to her by the readers of the Guardian. “If I could, I would also help people – take them to safe places, would help them settle,” she said. “After we experienced all this horror in Kutuzivka, I realised how important evacuation is for people from dangerous places.”"

Russian soldier’s Ukrainian lawyer defends role on eve of verdict;"Viktor Ovsyannikov speaks out on his defence of a 21-year-old tank commander who shot and killed an unarmed civilian
Defending a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine is no easy task, which is why some people have described Viktor Ovsyannikov as “the devil’s advocate”.
But the 43-year-old Ukrainian is unrepentant. “First of all, I am defending a person, not a crime,” Ovsyannikov said on Sunday on the eve of the verdict in the trial of the 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin, who has already pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian in late February. “I’m trying to prove that my defendant’s actions were misqualified. It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.”
“My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it. But there are other people who ‘invited’ me to go to Moscow or Donbas [the area in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia-backed separatists].”
Prosecutors were astonished on Friday when Ovsyannikov asked judges in the courtroom in Kyiv to acquit Shishimarin despite his guilty plea, on the grounds that he had executed an order. The Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order and therefore did not protect Shishimarin from responsibility.
Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines.
Shishimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk, in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia, and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on 28 February, the day that 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died in Chupakhivka village.
Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone a few dozen metres from his home. One of the men in the car told Shishimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window and shot down Shelipov.
This is not Ovsyannikov’s first controversial trial. In 2014 he defended the Russia-backed former president Viktor Yanukovych, who was eventually found guilty of high treason and sentenced in absentia to 13 years in prison over attempts to quash a pro-western uprising.
Ovsyannikov argues that ever since he accepted the task of defending Shishimarin, people have asked him the same question: “How can you defend a war criminal?”
“And I am so tired of explaining that, in Ukraine, only a court of law can recognise one as a criminal. And, as far as I know, there is no verdict for my defendant at the moment.”
The trial is unprecedented in Ukraine, where authorities are moving fast and trying to carry out justice while conflict is ongoing. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases for war crimes trials. Monday’s verdict is being seen as a public test of the independence of Ukraine’s judicial system.
“Of course, it is quite an important test and there is even stronger pressure from society on the judges to find him guilty,” said Ovsyannikov.
“My first impression of Shishimarin was of an ordinary person, just like you or me,” he said. “My second impression, when I started to work with him, is that he began to understand what had done. The only thing he desires now is to go back home. I am under this impression that he perceives this as some kind of a dream.”
“Sometimes,” he added, “I feel pity for him.”
This article was amended on 23 May 2022 to change the spelling of Vadim Shishimarin to put into Guardian style."

A Ukrainian man who converted almost all his family’s money into the crypto “stablecoin” terra in April in an effort to protect against the risks of invasion or currency collapse has lost almost $10,000 (£8,000) after its sudden demise.
“It was impossible and unsafe to store funds in the form of banknotes,” said Yuri Popovich, who lives in Kyiv. Cryptocurrencies advertised as safe and “backed with fiat currency” suggested another option.
Unlike most cryptocurrency purchases, buying a stablecoin isn’t intended to be a risky investment. The tokens, with names such as “terra”, “tether” and “USD coin”, are supposed to maintain a fixed value of one token to one US dollar. “I am not a speculator; I just wanted to save money,” Popovich said.
But when terra collapsed in early May, as well as sparking a broader meltdown in the cryptocurrency sector, it wiped out the savings of retail investors. “I stopped sleeping normally, lost 4kg; I often have headaches and anxiety,” Popovich said. “My wife still doesn’t know about this loss. I don’t know how to tell her.”
His savings, according to a screenshot seen by the Guardian, are now worth less than $500. “This is a colossal amount for us, and in the current situation it is critically important for life. I fear for my wife’s health, my health and our relationship. I don’t even know how it will end.”
Popovich is one an unknown number of retail investors who lost money in the collapse of terra, which at one point had almost $50bn invested in it and is now worth barely $1bn. As well as those looking for a safe place to keep their funds, others were lured in by the promise of interest rates topping 20% a year, in a currency that was theoretically pegged to the dollar.
But the interest rates, and ultimately the stability of the currency itself, relied on the continued interest of investors. That property led many to accuse terra, and other similar tokens, of effectively being a Ponzi scheme."

Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. In Mykolaiv, in the south, Russian rockets reportedly struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka.
Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. Russia is deploying Terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said.
Severodonetsk has been attacked from “four separate directions”, said the region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking the export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports.
Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said: “Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you.” Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion.
Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to its fellow EU member Estonia.
Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Zelenskiy said: “Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.”"

Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe.
Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the crude explosive, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military.
Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European warnings that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing.
Barrel bombs – crude explosives packed in to a drum and dropped from a helicopter – were used to devastating effect throughout the Syrian war. The regime was also regularly accused of filling canisters with chlorine and dropping them on opposition held towns and cities, causing hundreds of deaths and sparking widespread alarm.
With no anti-aircraft weapons, the anti-Assad opposition had little to counter the Syrian military’s air supremacy, which was a big factor in the regime clawing back parts of the country after 10 years of war.
The situation is very different in Ukraine, however, where Ukrainian troops armed with lethal ground to air missiles can bring down Russian jets and helicopters, stalling advances and exposing ground forces to withering artillery fire.
“This is probably why we haven’t seen them cross the border,” said one European official. “We know the capacity is there, but if they use it, they lose; we will know who’s done it, and they will likely be killed anyway.”
The barrel bomb specialists were at the vanguard of the forces the Syrian government sent to Russia to support Putin, whose backing had been instrumental in securing Assad regime’s grip on power.
The officials believe between 800 and 1,000 Syrian troops have so far volunteered to travel to Russia, where the Kremlin has promised them salaries of between $1,500-$4,000 – up to 20 times the amounts they would receive in Syria, where an economic collapse has ravaged the local currency’s value.
The Syrian government has established four main recruiting centres for the Russian deployment, in Damascus, Latakia, Hama and Homs. Recruits are deployed under contract with the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organisation, which has played a leading role in hiring mercenaries to support Russia’s foreign adventures.
Wagner has been prominent in Libya and eastern Syria supporting Russia’s interests. However, it has sometimes had a frayed relationship with the Kremlin. In early 2018, its forces were engaged in a brutal battle with US and Kurdish forces in the Syrian province of Deir Azzour, in which more than 140 mercenaries were killed, mainly by US artillery. European officials say that the Russian government had given a green light for the attack.
“It seems they had gotten too big for their boots,” an official said. “We know for a fact that the Kremlin cut them loose.”
Ever since though, Wagner has been central to Russia’s actions. Its forces were among the first deployed into Ukraine and are accused of committing atrocities in Bucha, where up to 1,000 people were massacred over a few days in early April.
A relative of a Syrian army lieutenant who signed up to fight in Ukraine denied his uncle was a mercenary. “They are going there as a regular army unit,” he said. “He is traveling with a full platoon. Only four of them didn’t want to go. Putin did a lot for us, and we can help him now.”
In late April, the Ukrainian government claimed that up to 25 Libyan or Syrian fighters had been killed in the town of Popasna, though this was denied by both Syrian officials and opposition members.
“I asked my uncle that,” said the relative who refused to be named. “He said it’s not them, but it might be Libyans. He insists that not one of them has crossed the border.”
Wagner is thought to have deployed up to 500 men as reconnaissance elements in Ukraine. Many have been flown in from hotspots around north and central Africa."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/22/youtube-ukraine-invasion-russia-video-removals;2022-05-22;YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war;"Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.
The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion.
Since the conflict began in February, YouTube has taken down channels including that of the pro-Kremlin journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Channels associated with Russia’s Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs have also been temporarily suspended from uploading videos in recent months for describing the war as a “liberation mission”.
YouTube’s chief product officer, Neal Mohan, said: “We have a major violent events policy and that applies to things like denial of major violent events: everything from the Holocaust to Sandy Hook. And of course, what’s happening in Ukraine is a major violent event. And so we’ve used that policy to take unprecedented action.”
In an interview with the Guardian, Mohan added that YouTube’s news content on the conflict had received more than 40m views in Ukraine alone.
“The first and probably most paramount responsibility is making sure that people who are looking for information about this event can get accurate, high-quality, credible information on YouTube,” he said. “The consumption of authoritative channels on our platform has grown significantly, of course in Ukraine, but also in countries surrounding Ukraine, Poland, and also within Russia itself.”
YouTube did not provide a breakdown of the taken-down content and channels but Mohan said much of it represented Kremlin narratives about the invasion. “I don’t have the specific numbers, but you can imagine a lot of it being the narratives that are coming from Russian government, or Russian actors on behalf of the Russian government,” he said.
YouTube has an estimated 90 million users in Russia, although it no longer allows advertising on the platform in the country. The decision by YouTube’s parent company, Google, has drawn protests from Navalny, who said well-targeted ads helped counteract Kremlin propaganda.
“YouTube remains the largest video-sharing site up and running in Russia itself,” said Mohan. “So YouTube is a place where Russian citizens can get uncensored information about the war, including from many of the same authoritative channels that we all have access to outside of the country. We remain an important platform for Russian citizens themselves as this crisis continues to evolve.”
Last week, the Russian minister for digital development, Maksut Shadaev, said the country would not block YouTube, despite disputes over content that have resulted in the platform being fined in court for not removing banned videos.
Shadaev indicated that blocking Russia’s most popular social media platform would affect users. “We are not planning to close YouTube,” the minister said. “Above all, when we restrict something, we should clearly understand that our users won’t suffer.”
YouTube has also placed a worldwide ban on channels associated with Russian state media, including Russia Today and Sputnik. Facebook and Instagram are banned in Russia and access to Twitter has been restricted, in response to the platforms’ own bans on Russian state-owned media."

It is a 10-minute drive from Serhi Belyaev’s house in the village of Tsyrkuny to his fiancee’s home in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. A quick spin west on Soborna Street, over the E40 motorway on to the Lesia Serduika highway, and you are there. That was, until the war came.
It took just hours for Russian forces to sweep into Belyaev’s village on 24 February, as they advanced on Kharkiv, the closest major Ukrainian city to the Russian border.
Lives across Ukraine were changed that morning. For Belyaev, the frontline of the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war now lay between him and both his girlfriend, Nataliy Drozd, 28, and his parents.
No longer the familiar road into town, Lesia Serduika was now an impassable no man’s land. Belyaev was cut off, worried for his sick mother, Galina, 66, and determined to be with his terrified girlfriend.
Then Belyaev, 32, a professional poker player, had an idea. A gamble. He mused on it, initially rejected it and then settled on it. He would replace the 10km drive with a 3,700km odyssey.
“To the Russian border, through Russia to Latvia, on to Lithuania and Poland and then back into western Ukraine to come at Kharkiv from the west,” he says. “It was a bit crazy, yes.” But it was possible.
What followed was an extraordinary adventure that brought Belyaev to the attention of the Kremlin’s secret police, the FSB, who rightly suspected him of giving away Russian positions to the Ukrainian army. He traversed cities under fire, driving in against the flow of refugees, and there were, he admits, moments of doubt. “But only briefly: I had to get to my fiancee.”
In the first days of the war, Belyaev and his brother Yuri, 45, fled Tsyrkuny, which was in flames, for Strilecha, a village a short way north that was occupied but not under fire.
Belyaev started talking to families who wanted to get to Poland. He decided he would join a convoy of four cars in his black Honda Accord. “The car needed repairs to the brakes and the transmission,” he recalls. “It made terrible noises, but there was no other option.”
Yuri, who has a heart condition, chose to stay behind to look after their dog. His place in the car was taken by two strangers: Emil, 28, and Emil’s fiancee, Katya, 22. On 4 April at 1pm they set off. It was a jittery start.
“We had been told by Russian soldiers the border, a kilometre away, would be open. But it wasn’t,” Belyaev recalls. The only viable option was to drive 70km through occupied land to a second border crossing. “That 70km was the hardest,” says Belyaev. “There were lots of checkpoints and, halfway there, we came to some Russian soldiers who wouldn’t let us through.”
The convoy was turned round. They were directed by the soldiers towards what they would soon discover was a filtration camp in a local administrative building. Their lives were on the line. “We were all interrogated. They were very suspicious of Emil, who was from Luhansk in the east and didn’t have a passport as it had been burned at the start of the war. His phone was also broken because of the humidity in the cellar where he had hidden from the bombardments.”
Emil was undressed to his underwear so they could search for tattoos that might offer evidence of a military affiliation. Then they went through Belyaev’s phone. “I had deleted everything,” he says. “If I hadn’t, I would be dead. I didn’t sit with my hands in my pockets when the war began. I sent locations of Russian military convoys to friends in the territorial defence.”
But the group were finally handed the documents they needed at 4pm on the first day of the journey. A 5pm Russian curfew was looming. Those breaking it were liable to be shot.
Belyaev put his foot down, unsure whether he was on the right road as there was no data coverage, no road signs and they were on dirt tracks. “We had to cross a bridge at the village of Rubizhne. I saw it being built when I was 10 when my brother took me fishing,” Belyaev says. Now it was in ruins. “I saw its birth and I saw its death,” he adds. There was just one lane still standing. “It wouldn’t take much weight,” Belyaev says. “I was terrified at that point. It was a 20-metre drop to the river below.”
But they made it – and at the next checkpoint, the convoy of cars was waved through. The mood of the group lifted. But disaster struck. One of the drivers had got overexcited. “He was driving a bit faster – and he hit a pot hole hard.” The car’s front wheels were badly damaged and there was no way it could complete the journey. They drove to the closest city, Vovchansk, with a heavy heart. “But again pure luck,” says Belyaev. “The first person I asked about where a garage might be said he was a mechanic. He repaired the car so quickly that we could get going immediately.”
It was now 7pm and the border was due to close at 8pm. But the mechanic was confident they would get through. “We went but there was no electricity, so it was pitch black,” Belyaev recalls. “I was the lead car. Then, out of nowhere, right in front of me, was a soldier with a machine gun. We were at the border.”
It took five hours to get across after a thorough questioning. “And then we decided to turn right – I don’t know why because it was the wrong way,” says Belyaev. The soldiers blinked the lights on their military vehicles. They had their machine guns out and were now suspicious and aggressive.
“We explained that we didn’t know the way.” The soldiers conferred. “But they accepted it and waved us on.”
As the convoy went on its way, Emil joked, “What do we need to do to get shot?” But now, at 3am on the second day, they were in Putin’s Russia. “I sent a text to Nataliy telling her where I was, just saying that it was safer there,” says Belyaev. “She was actually angry because I had left the dog behind. I didn’t tell her about my plan to come back in. I was worried my communications would be intercepted.”
The convoy drove on, heading to Belgorod, the closest big Russian city. Almost immediately they were waved down again. It was the FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB. “Every single one of us was interrogated again,” says Belyaev. “But I knew my phone was clean. They asked me about my job. We must have spent 20 minutes talking about poker.”
They reached Belgorod around 5am, where they slept in their cars outside a supermarket. “But this was enemy territory. We knew we had to sleep less and drive more.” They were up again two hours later. Belyaev played music on his phone. The soundtrack, Belyaev laughs, was Gwen Stefani, Jay-Z and Limp Bizkit.
Their trip then took them through Kursk, Roslavl, Smolensk and Velikiye Luki, where they arrived at 5am on the second day, to snatch some sleep. Exhausted, they finally reached the Ubylinka border crossing into Latvia at 10am the following day, 6 April.
It took 16 hours to get through border control. “But it was such a relief,” recalls Belyaev. “I felt I was a man with rights again. I called Nataliy and my parents and told her about my real plans. Nataliy said, ‘You have a chance to stay in safety. You should stay there because men between 18 and 60 aren’t allowed to leave Ukraine. We can be together when the war ends’.”
Belyaev had no time to think. It was 2am and they were facing a 1,000km journey to Poland via Latvia. At midday they stopped at Kaunas in southern Lithuania. “This was the first wifi – in McDonald’s. I called my friends and parents. ‘I am eating McDonald’s. How about you?’,” he laughs.
The convoy headed off again, this time to Warsaw, arriving at 7pm. His fellow travellers had reached their destination: a large expo hall turned into a refugee centre. Belyaev had to make a decision. He pondered during a seven-day stay in Warsaw. The risks seemed grave. He was also sick with Covid symptoms and getting worse. But he felt he had to go on. “I told Nataliy that I wanted to come back. I said, ‘Wait for me, baby’.”
On 14 April, at 2pm, Belyaev left Warsaw for the Rava-Ruska border, joining a humanitarian convoy. They reached Lviv, Ukraine’s most westerly city, at midnight, loaded up some supplies, and set off. This was wartime Ukraine: every road posed a risk.
“A lot of roads were closed – it added probably 100km to our 550km journey. But it is nothing when you are driving 3,700km rather than 10km to get home,” laughs Belyaev.
He reached Kyiv at noon on 15 April and slept at a friend’s – in a bed for the first time in 11 days. On the morning of 18 April, he left Kyiv for Poltava, a city halfway to his destination, where his younger brother lived. “It was the first time I had driven alone,” says Belyaev. “I found it hard.” In Poltava, he picked up medicines for his parents and he was now en route to the very frontline of the war in Ukraine, where his village remained cut off and the battle of Kharkiv raged. But Belyaev had no doubts. It was perhaps even time for a little surprise.
“I rang my dad and told him a volunteer was near with supplies, so he should come down,” Belyaev smiles. “And he found me.” The men hugged. With his mum, tears flowed. Then, just 50 metres from Nataliy’s house, he was stopped by police. “They were suspicious of the blankets and the state of my car. They asked if I had been sleeping in it, and why. It was only my passport stamps that persuaded them of my story.”
Finally he was, however, back with the woman he loved. Had Belyaev made the right decision to head back? Nataliy smiles: “Home is home.”"

Ministers have been accused of choosing the “worst moment in history” to slash the foreign aid budget, as provisional figures showed that UK overseas humanitarian funding was cut by more than half last year.
MPs and charity campaigners say the aid budget urgently needs to be increased to cope with the Ukraine conflict and the risk of famine in Africa. Up to 23 million people face acute hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia due to drought.
The UN has warned the Ukraine crisis risks tipping 1.7 billion people – one-fifth of the global population – into poverty, destitution and hunger. The government said last week it now intends to boost humanitarian aid by giving less money to international organisations and focusing on direct aid from the UK.
Western officials reportedly fear that Vladimir Putin is “weaponising” global food supplies. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of the world’s wheat and barley exports.
Sarah Champion MP, Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, said: “It would be hard to consider a worse moment in history for the government to be cutting its foreign aid budget.
“We are the only member of the rich country G7 grouping to be doing so. It is having a damaging effect on our international standing – and the survival chances of some of the poorest people on the planet.”
Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a controversial reduction of aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income in November 2020.
UK direct humanitarian aid to foreign countries was £744m last year, compared with £1.53bn in 2020, a cut of 51%, according to the most recent provisional UK aid figures. UK official development assistance was nearly £11.5bn last year, compared with £14.48bn in 2020, a fall of 21%.
Separate figures published in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) annual report last year revealed direct UK aid and planned aid to Ethiopia fell from £241m in 2020/21 to £108m in 2021/22, a cut of 55%; aid to Kenya fell from £67m to £41m, a cut of 39%; and aid to Somalia fell from £121m to £71m, a cut of 41%.
One of the largest global humanitarian crises is in Yemen, devastated by eight years of civil war. About 24 million people need help, including nearly 13 million children. UK aid to Yemen fell from £221m 2020/21 to £82m in 2021/22, a cut of 63%.
Sam Nadel, Oxfam’s head of government relations, said: “The government is cutting aid at a time we have war in Ukraine, the Covid pandemic and millions of people in Africa on the brink of starvation. It’s the most horrific timing. It’s also shortsighted because aid helps tackle global challenges, which helps the UK in the long term.”
Ministers have announced £220m in humanitarian and development aid for Ukraine, putting more pressure on the reduced UK aid budget.
Kate Munro, head of advocacy at charity Action Against Hunger, said aid funding needed to return to 0.7% of GNI and ministers should urgently announce a new aid package for the millions of people facing starvation in east Africa. “It saves money to act early in a crisis,” she said.
The charity will attend an event in parliament this week to campaign for more aid for east Africa. It is calling for a funding commitment from the government of £750m, similar to the amount provided in 2017 when east Africa was also hit by drought and widespread famine was averted.
Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, last week announced a new international development strategy, with aid targeted to help deliver the UK’s foreign policy objectives. More money will be spent on direct aid from the UK, rather than internationally.
Champion last week described the new strategy as a “rehash of existing slogans’, but welcomed its focus on women and girls. She said a policy of “aid for trade” was dangerous and could distort the core purpose of international assistance to support the poor and most vulnerable.
The FCDO said: “Stepping up our life-saving humanitarian work to prevent the worst forms of human suffering around the world is one of the top priorities the foreign secretary laid out in the UK’s international development strategy this week.
“We will prioritise humanitarian funding levels at £3bn over the next three years, to remain a global leader in crisis response, including in Africa.”"

Ukrainian forces have built a new line of defences along the country’s previously unfortified northern border with Belarus amid signs of another attack.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv.
On 10 May, Belarus’s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a “southern threat” from Ukraine and Nato. Belarus has been conducting military drills on its border with Ukraine since early May.
The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has been Russia’s closest ally in its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Lukashenko urged the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, which met in Moscow, to remain united on Ukraine and accused the west of prolonging the conflict.
The Guardian was given access to Ukraine’s border positions on the condition that it did not disclose the exact locations or the surnames of the Ukrainians serving.
In the forests along the Belarusian border, a Ukrainian territorial defence unit made up of fighters between the ages of 19 and the mid-60s, is manning a network of trenches and positions constructed since the February invasion.
Before February, much of Ukraine’s border with Belarus consisted of small kiosk-like checkpoints which Russian tanks broke through with ease. Two days after the invasion, Ukraine closed all its border crossings with Belarus and Russia.
In their analysis of the threat from Belarus, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said last week that the presence of Belarusian forces on the border would probably prevent Ukraine from deploying support operations on its Donbas front.
Armed with AK47s and a few dozen men per position, the fighters hope the Belarusian border will not be used by invading forces again.
“We’ll be in the frying pan,” joked Vova, a man who volunteered to fight in the Donbas in 2014 and was in the Soviet army. Vova signed up to fight alongside his brother, Ihor, and his brother’s son, Maksym, on the second day of the war.
“They took the first 500 men in the queue that day, but there were over 800 of us,” said Ihor, sat between his brother and son at the makeshift barracks near the border.
“I’ve got hypertension, he’s got hypertension, he’s on insulin,” said Ihor, pointing around the room at the middle-aged and pension-aged men. “And then the other part of the unit is younger guys like Maksym.”
Ihor and Maksym were working on a construction site in Kyiv on the morning of the invasion. They rushed back to the Zhytomyr region, where their family live, to sign up. Territorial defence units in Ukraine are made up of people who fight in the same region as where they live.
The men and a few women in the unit said some of them knew each other from before the war. In almost every other case, there is only a few degrees of separation.
“In some cases, it was like, ‘Oh, your grandmother knows my grandfather, maybe we’re brothers’,” said Ihor, who added that fighting among people from his own region gave him a great sense of duty and motivation. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST
The unit said they do not have the back up of heavy artillery units, but that they were fortunate to have local geography on their side. The miles-long narrow roads that lead down from the border are surrounded by thick forests which cover the deep, swampy ground.
“No one has ever managed to hold this territory for that reason,” said Ihor, the unit’s military press secretary, speaking about battles around the northern border during the second world war."

It is one of Britain’s most controversial property sales. A former multimillionaire banker warns that proceeds from the disposal of his £6.5m Kent country estate risk being sent to help fund Vladimir Putin’s war machine.
Ilya Yurov, 50, who is originally from Moscow, is being pursued with two former colleagues for $900m (£720m) from the National Bank Trust in Russia after losing a high court case.
National Bank Trust is tasked with recovering billions of pounds from around the world to send back to Russia, but to date has escaped the UK sanctions list. As revealed by the Observer last week, it is majority owned by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and was once promoted by the actor Bruce Willis.
Yurov bought Oxney Court in Kent, a 17th-century gothic-style mansion with crenellated walls and towers, in 2012. The property was destroyed by a blaze during the first world war when it was commandeered as an operation headquarters and place of recuperation for soldiers returning from the front. It was meticulously rebuilt in 1998. The 14-hectare (35-acre) estate, with tennis court and pool, has been put on the market for £6.5m to help pay his debt.
Speaking at the Grade II-listed building last week, he accepted that the property needed to be sold and money recovered, but said National Bank Trust should urgently be put on the sanctions list.
He said: “I can’t accept that this money can go back to the Russian state. I feel sick that it could be used to support horrible atrocities. The west can’t turn a blind eye to this. It’s illogical that the bank is not sanctioned.”
Yurov, a father of six, said the funds returned to the Russian state could be used to support the war. He said state-controlled banks were providing loans and finance for defence contractors in the face of global sanctions.
Ministers announced sanctions targeting the central bank in February, but face questions over concerns that National Bank Trust may be a conduit for funds going to Putin. The Foreign Office declined to comment last week.
The Observer understands lawyers in the case have said that National Bank Trust is not a sanctioned entity, so funds can be transferred.
Executives at National Bank Trust have said they are tasked with recovering £6bn of global assets by 2023. This includes debts such as those owed by Yurov and colleagues, Nikolay Fetisov, a former president of the bank, and Sergey Belyaev.
National Trust Bank alleges the three former shareholders fraudulently used offshore companies to conceal bad debts and extract millions of dollars. The bank had a state bailout after it collapsed in 2014.
Yurov and Fetisov said they properly used offshore companies to manage bad debts. Belyaev said he had no knowledge of the scheme.
The high court ruled in January 2020 that the three men owed the bank compensation. The judge ruled that the three former owners had evaded banking standards. He found Yurov to be a “dishonest and untruthful witness”. Yurov said he considered the judgment unfair, but has exhausted all avenues of appeal. He was bankrupted by the case.
Yurov’s family estate is in the name of his wife, Nataliya, but the court ruled that he owned half of the property. The trustees acting for Yurov’s creditors will be entitled to half of the estate when it is sold.
The main creditor is National Bank Trust, but trustees have said no transactions will occur with sanctioned entities, or their subsidiaries, without permission of the courts.
Russia tried to extradite Yurov in 2018, but the request was refused on the grounds that he would not get a fair trial. He was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison for organising theft of funds from a credit institution. He denies the charge."

Childcare issues and inflexible working hours are preventing Ukrainian women from getting jobs as they attempt to rebuild their lives in Britain. Ukrainian refugees told the Observer they were shocked to discover the cost and inaccessibility of childcare and after-school provision and that they were struggling to navigate the system.
For many, the problem is exacerbated by language issues – meaning they cannot access better-paid jobs, even if they are highly qualified.
With childcare unaffordable for many, Anya Abdulakh, a trustee of the charity Families4Peace, which is helping newly arrived Ukrainians in north London, said mothers are struggling to find work that fits around school hours. Abdulakh is trying to get childcare providers to offer free or reduced-cost places for Ukrainian children. In the long term, she said, government help is needed for the “thousands” of women she thinks will be affected.
Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refugees are theoretically guaranteed free accommodation for six months, but many are worried about not having a job and enough money saved up for when they have to rent for themselves.
“So, being able to be employed is security that you can offer to your child going forward when you have to pay for the rent,” said Abdulakh. If they can’t, she added, some may be forced to go back to Ukraine, even if the war is continuing.
When she tried to help a beautician get free childcare for her two-year-old son so that she could work, she was told there was nothing until September. Another Ukrainian mother, Victoria Shcherbyna, 42, has been living in temporary accommodation for seven weeks in a village in Ukraine near the Hungarian border with her seven-year-old daughter, Sofia. They are waiting for their UK visas to be approved while her husband remains in Kyiv. Although she has a Homes for Ukraine host, and a job in sales, set up in London, she is becoming increasingly concerned about childcare.
She had hoped that Sofia would be able to attend a summer camp during the holidays at relatively low cost, like in Ukraine before the war. But after speaking to UK-based Ukrainian mothers, she realised that it would be unaffordable and finish too early in the day. “I have received many messages back like ‘This is the reality, you get used to it’,” she said. She is also concerned about after-school care. While she feels fearful and powerless, she is trying to make the process as stress-free as possible for Sofia, who she said “has seen enough”, by presenting their move as an adventure.
“There is not much I can do. I just need to adapt somehow and I have only one thought in my mind: that there is nothing that is impossible for me, that I have to cope with everything and find solutions because otherwise it won’t work.”
Through tears, she said at first she didn’t want to leave her husband and Ukraine, but that she must, for her children’s future. Her son Danylo, 19, is at Manchester University, so this way at least they will keep part of their family together.
Kateryna Chernyaeva, 43, arrived in London from Kyiv only last week with her son Dima, 12, and is now trying to find a school for him that also runs after-school clubs, to fit around her work. In Ukraine she worked as an HR director and is hoping to find work in the UK but, she said, “at the same time I need to know that my child, [for] the whole day, will be safe.”
“I left all of my life and family in Kyiv. It’s very hard to realise everything has changed,” she said. But she is determined to work out their new life in London. “I’m trying to adapt to a new life and I understand I have to start from scratch. I’m ready because I’m a strong person and, if I believe in myself, I’ll be OK. But at the same time I really want to see my parents, husband, brother.”
Meanwhile, community organisations said the hurdles faced by Ukrainian refugees – mainly women and children fleeing the Russian invasion alone as the family’s sole breadwinner, while most men are required to stay in the country – highlight the existing systemic issues in childcare provision for all families across the UK. They also accused the government of leaning too heavily on the voluntary sector to help newly arrived Ukrainians, and called for more funding to help the charities and organisations that were attempting to fill in the gaps.
Iryna Terlecky, head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Great Britain, said that the difficulties faced by Ukrainians, “to a huge extent have highlighted some of the systemic issues there are for childcare and children’s activities – not only for smaller children but also for older children and teenagers”.
The Local Government Association said access to good quality childcare was vital and called on the government to significantly increase funding.
A government spokesperson said: “All children and young people living in the UK have a right to access education and childcare, including those from Ukraine, and ministers have been clear that supporting families is a priority.
“We have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver free childcare offers, and are working across government to look for more ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare places. We have also legislated for the right to flexible working, and shared parental leave and pay, to better support eligible working parents.”"

The lights dimmed, a hush came over the auditorium and the orchestra struck up the first notes of the overture. This ritual has taken place thousands of times at Kyiv’s grand opera house over the past century, but the performance on Saturday afternoon was something out of the ordinary.
In a city that over the past three months became used to wailing air-raid sirens and the thuds of artillery from the suburbs, the audience was instead treated to the frothy melodies of Rossini’s The Barber of Seville.
It marked the first performance since the missiles and shells of Vladimir Putin’s invasion rudely interrupted the opera season – and everything else in Ukraine – in the early hours of 24 February.
Now, less than three months later and with fierce battles still raging in the eastern part of the country, the opera is back, although with some changes. Performances will only take place on weekend afternoons, a maximum of 300 tickets are sold, and the audience has to be ready to move quickly to the basement cloakrooms if air-raid sirens sound during a performance.
Saturday’s audience was a mix of couples enjoying their first opportunity for weeks to wear their most elegant outfits, and soldiers in military fatigues taking a break from their army service for some high culture.
Only the stalls were full, with the four tiers of gilded balconies off-limits to ensure an evacuation could take place more quickly if needed.
“I can’t say opera is my usual entertainment, but it is an incredible feeling to hear this music and to be in a different world for a little while, before coming back to our reality,” said Volodymyr, a soldier who only wanted to give his first name.
Many of the opera troupe are still abroad, and some in the orchestra are fighting on the frontline or serving in the territorial defence forces.
Oleksii Potiomkin, the principal dancer of the ballet, has joined up and is serving in the army, posting daily updates on Instagram.
But enough artists and technical staff are back at work for the company to put on full-scale opera stagings.
Soprano Olha Fomichova, who sang the lead role of Rosina on Saturday, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke of her emotions before going on stage.
“I had the feeling this morning that I was coming to sing a premiere, even though I have been singing this role for years. I feel like I’m coming out on to this stage, which I know so well, for the first time,” she said.
Fomichova mostly stayed in Kyiv during the invasion but sent her son to safety in Germany. She saw him recently when she travelled there to take part in a charity gala to help Ukraine, and both the family reunion and the concert were emotional, she said.
“When you take a Ukrainian flag on to the stage for the curtain call and you are met with a 10-minute standing ovation, I don’t have words to describe the feeling,” she said.
Over the past three months, the soloists have kept in touch in a chat group on Viber, swapping stories about how the war was going for them, said Natalia Nykolaishyn, a soprano who has been at the theatre for 20 years.
“We were all very close before, but now we feel like family,” she said. On Sunday, Nykolaishyn will sing the lead role in the opera  Natalka Poltavka by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko.
“We wanted to open with symbolic performances: first a European classic and then a Ukrainian classic,” said culture minister Oleksandr Tkachenko, who attended Saturday’s performance.
Kyiv’s opera house has seen a lot over the years, on and off the stage. Opened in 1901 after a fire destroyed the previous building, a decade later it was the scene of a dramatic assassination.
Prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, attending a Rimsky-Korsakov opera with Tsar Nicholas II, was shot dead during the interval while standing in the front row of the stalls.
The pause in performances during the Russian invasion is only the third lengthy gap in activity over the past century, said the theatre’s archivist Larisa Tarasenko.
The first was between the end of the Nazi occupation and the return of the evacuated Soviet troupe. The second was due to Covid. Otherwise, performances continued even as regimes, empires and ideological slants changed.
Now, with the Russian invasion, the theatre plans to remove all of its Russian repertoire, at least for the time being.
Tkachenko said the culture ministry is actively lobbying opera houses abroad to remove Russian works from their repertoires, an issue which has stirred a debate in many countries over whether Russia’s cultural heritage should be separate from the actions of Putin’s government.
“We’re trying to argue that in a time of war, it is a symbolic move, and we should find ways to celebrate French, Italian and certainly Ukrainian composers,” said Tkachenko.
Nykolaishyn said she grew up on the Russian classics, and singing Tatyana in Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin was one of her first and favourite soloist roles.
“But right now, this is not the time for anything Russian. Maybe one day it will be possible again, I don’t know,” she said."

Ukraine has suggested that it is willing to resume talks with Russia as Moscow claimed to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol – its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February.
Speaking to a television channel on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place”.
“Under what format I don’t know – with intermediaries, without them, in a broader group, at the presidential level,” he added. “But the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.
“There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table. We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that.”
The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, responded by blaming Ukraine for stopping the talks. The last discussions between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies.
During the interview, held with a Ukrainian broadcaster, Zelenskiy spoke of creating a document enshrining security guarantees for his country. Although bilateral discussions would be held with Russia, the document would be signed by “friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow”, he added.
However, he warned that the precondition for resuming negotiations was that Moscow did not kill Ukrainian troops who had been defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. “The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,” he said.
Last week, Russia announced it had taken full control of Mariupol, the first major city to fall. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, bringing to an end a months-long siege of the defenders’ last stronghold.
“Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered.
Hours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by commanders that they should leave. In a live video posted on the messaging service Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained.
“The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,” he said. “I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.”
Ukraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.
The fall of Mariupol – the largest trading port on the Sea of Azov, from which Ukraine exports grain, iron, steel and heavy machinery – is a breakthrough for Russia. Taking control of the city means gaining a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea.
Fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas, where Zelenskiy said Russian troops had “completely ruined” the cities of Rubizhne and Volnovakha, “just as they did Mariupol”, adding that the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
Meanwhile, on Saturday the Russian energy company Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership last week.
Moscow had warned Finland that any such application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia, but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of the country’s annual energy consumption.
The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, said he and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had had “open and direct” talks to discuss the bid for Nato membership, after Erdoğan openly questioned whether Finland and Sweden, which has also applied, should be permitted to join."

When Russia invaded Ukraine, I couldn’t eat. And I definitely couldn’t cook for the first month and a half. It was the feeling of guilt. I just felt, “How can I even cook anything when there’s such horror happening everywhere else in Ukraine?” Then, at the first event I did for #CookForUkraine, this woman I’d never met before came up to me and said, “I’ve brought you some broth.” I heated it up at home and had it out of a cup and it was just so life-giving. Then she started sending me a broth every week, and she’s been doing it for two months now. And that’s what I’ve been sustaining myself on.
When I was writing Mamushka, people would say, “Oh, you’re writing a Ukrainian cookbook? Is that about dumplings and potatoes?” I understand it: stereotypes are stereotypes, but hopefully I’ve been able to break some of them. Even when I spoke of Ukraine back then, it was like, “Is that Russia?” No, it’s not fucking Russia! Our culture has for years and years and years been suppressed. Language, food, everything.
I only really realised the scope of my mum and my dad’s skills after I trained to be a chef. Watching Mum make filo pastry, stretching it out with her hands, then spinning it around in the air like a pizzaiolo – it’s like she’s spinning webs. I know loads of professional chefs who would not be able to do that.
Mamushka came out of a big jumble of things that were happening to me in 2014. I lost my job, I was a single mum, my son Sasha was nearly two years old. I was alone in the UK with no job and no prospects. Parallel to that, the Maidan [uprising] happens and the war starts in the Crimea. So it began, actually, as me writing down names of recipes in my notebook as a way of just doing something, and not sitting around and plunging myself into depression.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, I couldn’t eat. And I definitely couldn’t cook for the first month and a half. It was the feeling of guilt. I just felt, “How can I even cook anything when there’s such horror happening everywhere else in Ukraine?” Then, at the first event I did for #CookForUkraine, this woman I’d never met before came up to me and said, “I’ve brought you some broth.” I heated it up at home and had it out of a cup and it was just so life-giving. Then she started sending me a broth every week, and she’s been doing it for two months now. And that’s what I’ve been sustaining myself on.
When I was writing Mamushka, people would say, “Oh, you’re writing a Ukrainian cookbook? Is that about dumplings and potatoes?” I understand it: stereotypes are stereotypes, but hopefully I’ve been able to break some of them. Even when I spoke of Ukraine back then, it was like, “Is that Russia?” No, it’s not fucking Russia! Our culture has for years and years and years been suppressed. Language, food, everything.
I only really realised the scope of my mum and my dad’s skills after I trained to be a chef. Watching Mum make filo pastry, stretching it out with her hands, then spinning it around in the air like a pizzaiolo – it’s like she’s spinning webs. I know loads of professional chefs who would not be able to do that.
Mamushka came out of a big jumble of things that were happening to me in 2014. I lost my job, I was a single mum, my son Sasha was nearly two years old. I was alone in the UK with no job and no prospects. Parallel to that, the Maidan [uprising] happens and the war starts in the Crimea. So it began, actually, as me writing down names of recipes in my notebook as a way of just doing something, and not sitting around and plunging myself into depression. Then I ended up getting this book deal, miraculously, everything came together. I never looked for an agent or to publish, it was just for me.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/21/canada-announces-sanctions-on-alexander-lebedev-russia-ukraine-report;2022-05-21;UK under pressure over Alexander Lebedev sanctions after Canada move;"Labour says the case for the British government to follow Ottawa’s lead is ‘extremely strong’
The British government is under pressure to impose sanctions on Alexander Lebedev after Canada targeted the former KGB agent in a fresh wave of restrictions against Vladimir Putin’s regime.
The billionaire Russian businessman, who little more than a decade ago bought the UK’s Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, was named in Ottawa’s latest sanctions announced on Friday.
James Emmanuel Wanki, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, confirmed to the Guardian on Saturday that Alexander Yevgenievich Lebedev, born in 1959, is on Canada’s sanctions list against Russia.
The restrictions also included a ban on the import of Russian vodka, diamonds and caviar, according to the Globe and Mail.
A UK government spokesperson said: “This government has been resolute in standing up to Russian aggression. We keep all sanctions under review and they are determined after careful consideration.”
But Labour accused the government of dragging its feet in imposing sanctions on those with links to the Russian president.
The party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “Labour has been clear that anyone with links to the KGB must face sanctions. The Conservatives have been so slow and too soft in issuing sanctions to those with links to Putin.
“There is now an extremely strong case for Alexander Lebedev to face sanctions from the UK and the government must now urgently look at the evidence.”
She accused Boris Johnson of having “form when it comes to protecting the Lebedevs”.
“He failed to release critical information relating to the appointment of Alexander Lebedev’s son to the House of Lords, despite concerns from the security services. This is another case of the prime minister bending the rules to protect his friends,” she said.
Lebedev’s links to Johnson are well documented.
He is also a minority shareholder in the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta. His son Evgeny, who owns the Evening Standard and is a minority shareholder in The Independent, was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 despite concerns raised by MI5.
The government was accused of a cover-up last week after it declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make him a peer, claiming it would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into political point-scoring.
He published a statement in the Standard in February in which he pleaded with Putin to end the war.
The Canadian government said the ban on trade in luxury goods and the addition of 14 oligarchs and Putin associates was aligned with similar measures imposed by allies such as the US and the EU, and would “help to mitigate the potential for Russian oligarchs to circumvent restrictions in other luxury goods markets”.
The sanctions package, announced by Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, covers goods that were worth $75.7m (£47m) in 2021. It also bans the export of jewellery, art and kitchenware to Russia and restricts the export of “goods that could be used in the production and manufacture of weapons”.
“The Putin regime must, and will, answer for their unjustifiable acts,” Joly said. “Canada, together with our allies, will be relentless in our efforts to maintain pressure on the Russian regime until it is no longer able to wage war. We are unwavering in our support for Ukraine and its people.”
According to the Globe and Mail, other figures Canada has newly subjected to sanctions include Gleb Frank, a leading Russian fishery company owner; his father, Sergei Frank, the former minister of transport and former chief executive of Russian shipping firm Sovcomflot; and Sergei Frank’s wife, Ksenia Frank, the daughter of Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch and an associate of Putin.
David Davidovich, a close associate of Roman Abramovich, who has been forced to sell Chelsea football club after being placed under sanctions in the UK, was also sanctioned.
The fresh wave of sanctions came as talks between G7 countries and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, concluded in Germany.
Canada has to date sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/apocalypse-now-the-alarming-effects-of-the-global-food-crisis;2022-05-21;Apocalypse now? The alarming effects of the global food crisis;"The Bank of England governor warned last week of ‘apocalyptic’ food price rises. Yet war in Ukraine, climate change and inflation are already taking their toll all over the world
Apocalypse is an alarming idea, commonly taken to denote catastrophic destruction foreshadowing the end of the world. But in the original Greek, apokálypsis means a revelation or an uncovering. One vernacular definition is “to take the lid off something”.
That latter feat is exactly what Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, achieved last week, possibly inadvertently, when he suggested Britain was facing “apocalyptic” levels of food price inflation. Tory ministers fumed over what they saw as implied criticism of the government’s masterly economic management.
In fact, Bailey was talking as much about the drastic impact of Ukraine-war-related rises in food costs and food shortages on people in poorer countries. “There’s a major worry for the developing world as well ... Sorry for being apocalyptic for a moment, but that is a major concern,” he said.
With most political and media attention narrowly focused on the emerging UK “cost of living crisis”, Bailey’s high-profile comments were timely – and revelatory. Months of warnings about a global tidal wave of hunger, rendered more urgent by Ukraine, have been largely ignored, not least by Boris Johnson’s aid-cutting government.
The cost of living is a problem in Britain. For UN agencies and humanitarian relief workers around the world, the bigger worry is the cost of dying.
Sounding the alarm again last week, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said Ukraine-related shortages could help “tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity”. The result could be “malnutrition, mass hunger and famine in a crisis that could last for years” – and increase the chances of a global recession.
The World Food Programme estimates about 49 million people face emergency levels of hunger. About 811 million go to bed hungry each night. The number of people on the brink of starvation across Africa’s Sahel region, for example, is at least 10 times higher than in pre-Covid 2019.
The adverse impact of Russia’s invasion on the availability and price of staples such as wheat, maize, barley and sunflower oil – Ukraine and Russia normally produce about 30% of global wheat exports – has been huge.
Ukraine’s wheat production this year is likely to be 35% down, and exporting much of it may be impossible due to Russia’s Black Sea blockade. In March, global commodity prices, recorded by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, hit an all-time high. They remain at record-breaking levels.
Russia’s war has compounded or accelerated pre-existing food deficits and inflationary trends arising from a host of linked factors: the negative economic impact of the pandemic; resulting supply-chain, employment and transport problems; extreme weather and climate-crisis-related falls in output; spiralling energy costs; and numerous other ongoing conflicts worldwide.
Middle-income countries, such as Egypt and Brazil, are exceptionally poorly placed to cope with increased food insecurity, international risk consultants Verisk Maplecroft said in a report last week. Many governments had exhausted their financial and material reserves fighting Covid and incurred large debts.
Now the cupboard is bare. “Unlike low-income countries, they were rich enough to offer social protection during the pandemic, but now struggle to maintain high social spending that is vital to the living standards of large sections of their populations,” the report said.
Argentina, Tunisia, Pakistan and the Philippines, highly dependent on food and energy imports, were among many other middle- or lower-middle-income countries facing an elevated risk of civil unrest by the end of 2022, it suggested.
As the food “apocalypse” approaches, the poorest peoples will suffer, as they always do, while the wealthiest may be insulated, up to a point. But it is feared that the pain will rapidly move up the global food chain. With it is likely to come a surge in political turbulence, humanitarian crises, instability and geo-strategic rivalries across a hungry world.
Scarce food, combined with price increases, electricity blackouts and shortages of petrol, cooking gas and medicines, provoked a political crisis in Sri Lanka this spring that serves as a discomfiting template for countries facing similar problems.
Months of protests culminated in the resignation of the prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, but even his scalp did not prevent unrest turning violent. Desperate, Sri Lanka has been seeking a bridging loan from the World Bank to help pay for essential imports. On Thursday, it defaulted on its debt for the first time ever.
Double-digit inflation that left many Pakistanis unable to afford basic foodstuffs was also a major contributory factor in the fall from power earlier this year of the prime minister, Imran Khan. His attempt to cling to office created a crisis of democracy with which Pakistan is still grappling.
Longer-term factors – repressive governance, corruption, incompetence, polarisation – fuelled unrest in both countries. But dire food shortages and inflation were the catalyst that rendered the objectionable intolerable. That’s a prospect now facing insecure and unpopular regimes from Peru, the Philippines and Cuba to Lebanon and Tunisia.
Analysts compare what is happening today in the Middle East with the Arab spring revolts. Egypt, whose government was overthrown in 2011, is the world’s largest wheat importer. About 70 million people rely on state-subsidised bread. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 80% of Egypt’s grain imports last year.
Today’s high prices and supply shortfalls, especially if they worsen, could do for Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s regime what similar grievances did for his deposed presidential predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.
Another country to watch closely is Iran. Violent protests erupted last week in Khuzestan after the government raised the price of bread, cooking oil and dairy products. Iranians’ situation is made worse by tough US sanctions and a tyrannical, corrupt clerical regime. If living standards continue to fall, there could be an explosion similar to the thwarted nationwide uprising of 2017-18.
In many parts of the world, especially Africa, food insecurity is anything but a new phenomenon. Hunger is the norm and the risk of famine is ever-present, often exacerbated by conflict and climate change. That said, the situation, broadly speaking, is deteriorating.
The total number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent food assistance has nearly doubled since 2016, according to the Global Network Against Food Crises, a joint UN and EU project. And the scale of the challenge is expanding, up by 40 million people, or 20%, last year. The network’s latest report pinpointed countries of particular concern: Ethiopia, South Sudan, southern Madagascar and Yemen, where it said 570,000 people – up 571% on six years ago – were in the most severe or “catastrophe” phase of food insecurity, threatened by the collapse of livelihoods, starvation and death.
Guterres, the UN chief, warned that Vladimir Putin’s war was seriously affecting efforts to fight hunger in Africa. It was imperative, he said, to “bring back the agriculture production of Ukraine and the food and fertiliser production of Russia and Belarus into world markets”. As Russian state media often note, western sanctions have added to global price volatility.
The UN is calling for Ukraine’s blockaded Black Sea and Azov Sea ports to be reopened so that grain exports can resume, not least to African countries. Especially badly affected is the drought-hit Sahel region. “An absolute crisis is unfolding before our eyes,” the World Food Programme’s director, David Beasley, said following visits to Benin, Niger and Chad. “We’re running out of money, and these people are running out of hope.”
That’s partly because aid now costs more. The UN and international agencies are obliged to pay inflated prices, up about 30% from pre-Covid norms, to secure vital food aid. And it is partly because food is more expensive relative to income. An average UK household spends 10% of its income on food. In Kenya or Pakistan, it is over 40%.
Conflict is the biggest driver of hunger, whether it is the depredations of Islamist jihadists in Mali, Nigeria and the southern Philippines, the crass rivalries of regional powers in Yemen and Libya, or an unpardonable full-scale war, as in Ukraine.
The UN estimates that 60% of the world’s hungry live in conflict zones. Ukraine has shown again how war, by causing shortages of essentials and rendering normal life insupportable, leads to internal displacement, aid dependency, refugee emergencies and mass migration.
Syria’s civil war provides a cautionary example – although there are many others. A relatively prosperous country has been reduced by over a decade of conflict to something approaching a basket case. About 12.4 million people – 60% of the population – suffer food insecurity, a figure that has more than doubled since 2019.
Ethiopia’s disastrous war of choice in Tigray, which was invaded by government troops in 2019, is another case of famine following folly. The UN estimated in January that 2 million people were suffering from an extreme lack of food, and were dependent on aid in a province that was previously mostly self-sufficient.
In contrast, South Sudan has never been fully able to feed itself since independence in 2011. Ethnically rooted rivalries have often combined with competition for land and food resources with catastrophic effects. Cattle rustling is a key source of violence, while drought is another big factor.
Even when a struggling country is in the international spotlight – rarely the case with South Sudan – and the war is supposedly over, its fortunes do not necessarily improve. The plight of many Afghans appears to have gone from bad to worse after the 20-year occupation by US and Nato forces ended last year and the Taliban took charge.
The billions of dollars of aid ploughed into the country since 2001 now count for naught. Save the Children said this month that 9.6 million Afghan children are going hungry due to deepening economic woes, Ukraine, and ongoing drought. It is the country’s worst hunger crisis on record, the charity said.
It is no longer controversial to assert that destroyed crops, lost livelihoods and impoverished communities – key micro-ingredients of mass hunger emergencies – are intimately connected to, and affected by, climate change and extreme weather events. But it is still hard to find concerted, effective international action or public pressure to shift the dynamic.
Horn of Africa countries such as Somalia, for example, are experiencing the worst drought in 40 years amid unprecedentedly high temperatures. As Foreign Policy magazine reported recently, when the rains did come, they were extreme and short-lived, causing flooding and breeding swarms of locusts.
It is claimed that about 3 million livestock have perished in southern Ethiopia and semi-arid parts of Kenya since last year. Pointing to climate change, the UN says 20 million people across the region could go hungry this year. Their plight, too, has been exacerbated by Ukraine.
But when the charity Christian Aid commissioned polling on the Horn of Africa region to find out what the British public thought should be done, only 23% of those questioned were aware there was a problem. In contrast, 91% were aware of Putin’s war.
India recently demonstrated the lack of joined-up international thinking on climate, hunger and war. A record-breaking heatwave in north-west India has damaged this year’s crops. That led the government to suspend wheat exports this month. Global markets had been relying on India, the world’s second-largest producer, to make up the Ukraine shortfall. Instead of helping, Narendra Modi’s government did the opposite.
Critical links between the twin crises of climate and hunger are broadly recognised by governments and analysts, but acting to effect real change is proving harder, as the less-than-stellar outcomes of last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow suggest.
In the meantime, the World Bank is throwing money at the problem – at the latest count, $30bn to help low-income countries embroiled in climate and food crises.
When the history of the Ukraine war is written, Russia’s reckless action in weaponising food and deliberately disrupting global supplies, thereby risking the lives of countless millions, may be counted a bigger crime than even its unprovoked attack on its neighbour.
Russia’s role as a key grain and energy exporter is likely to outlive the current regime in Moscow. But its global standing and influence is diminished, probably permanently.
That is largely due to Putin’s personal failure to recognise, or accept, that the era of Soviet exceptionalism is over – and that Russia, like other countries, inhabits a newly interconnected, interdependent, mutually responsible world of rules, rights and laws.
The UN general assembly vote in March, overwhelmingly condemning as illegal Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, brought together many once Moscow-friendly developing countries shocked by Putin’s disregard for national sovereignty and borders – and his apparent indifference to the wellbeing of poorer nations dependent on food and fuel imports. It was a watershed moment.
China’s refusal to condemn the invasion, and its failure to show international leadership in addressing the resulting global hunger and supply crises, may also significantly damage its reputation and, with that, its hopes of hegemony. The contrast presented by the US is striking.
Addressing the UN last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the world faced “the greatest global food security crisis of our time”. Blinken announced an additional $215m in global emergency food assistance on top of $2.3bn already donated by the US since the Ukraine invasion began on 24 February.
If the looming global “apocalypse” revealed to parliament by Andrew Bailey does indeed materialise this winter, it will be to the US, the UK, their allies and the much-battered UN system – not China, the 21st century’s self-designated superpower – that the world must look for earthly salvation. The challenge ahead is truly biblical.

Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/only-diplomacy-can-end-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskiy;2022-05-21;Only diplomacy can end Ukraine war, says Volodymyr Zelenskiy;"Country’s president emphasises need for talks to resume with Russia after previous negotiations stalled
Ukraine’s president has said the war can only be resolved through diplomacy, despite the current suspension of negotiations.
“Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with a Ukrainian television channel.
“Under what format I don’t know – with intermediaries, without them, in a broader group, at the presidential level. But the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and will only definitively end through diplomacy.”
He added: “There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table. We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that,” he said.
The last talks between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of not wanting to continue talks to end the fighting.
During the interview, Zelenskiy spoke of a document about security guarantees for his country. Although a bilateral discussion would be held with Russia at the same time, the document would be signed by “friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow”, he added.
However, Zelenskiy warned that the precondition for resuming the negotiations with Moscow was that Russia does not kill Ukrainian troops who defended the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
“The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,” he said.
On Friday, Russia claimed to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol – in what has been described as Moscow’s biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February – after the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered. The move marked an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in the city.
“Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered.
Hours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by Ukraine’s military that they could get out and save their lives and would most probably all leave in the coming days.
In a live video posted on Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of the Azov regiment that has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained.
“The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,” he said. “I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.”
Ukraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.
Meanwhile on Saturday, Russia’s Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership.
Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied to join Nato, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption.
On the ground in Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern region of Donbas, where, Zelenskiy said, Russian troops “completely ruined the cities of Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as they did Mariupol”, adding that the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
And while the US Congress this week approved a $40bn (£32bn) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine’s armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system, Moscow claimed on Saturday it had destroyed a large shipment of US and European weapons, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles that allegedly hit Malin railway station, north-west of Kyiv, in the Zhytomyr region.
There was no Ukrainian or independent confirmation as to the success of the strike."
Guardian;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/21/psychologist-ukrainians-trauma-war-survivors;2022-05-21;As a psychologist helping Ukrainians, I am a witness to the terrible traumas of war;"We can support those trapped in shelters or struggling with survivor’s guilt. But some emotional damage is irreparable
All four of my grandparents survived the second world war, and all four were scarcely willing to talk about it, having either survived the siege of Leningrad or come back from the frontline wounded. On the rare occasions they did, their memories would leave them devastated.
The lifelong PTSD they experienced was quite possibly one of the reasons I became a psychologist. I wanted to do something to end the vicious circle of trauma, abuse, self-neglect and fear. But during my training, I could never have predicted the way I would be applying my skills a decade later.
On 25 February, the day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I volunteered to join several crisis hotlines where psychologists were working to support those affected by the war. I couldn’t stop the war, but at least I might try to lessen the damage. My colleagues come from many different countries – some of the Ukrainian psychologists kept working between bombings, while others had evacuated to a safer place. Quite a few of us, myself included, are living abroad in safety — a privilege too often taken for granted.
During the first weeks of the war, most of the Ukrainian people who texted or called us had either just been evacuated or were still in areas of heavy shelling. Those who managed to escape were suffering from survivor’s guilt, along with shock from the war in general. Those who stayed were experiencing shock in a different way, trying to navigate through their daily spikes of anxiety.
My first client was a person besieged in Ukraine. Their whole family had been hiding in a bomb shelter for days and they were experiencing panic attacks, partly from the sudden responsibility of having to care for elderly relatives and beloved pets. They had to make the kind of decisions no one should have to face.
As the war developed, everyone’s stress tolerance was wearing thinner and thinner. Those who fled Ukraine reported apathy and a loss of the will to live. Old traumas have resurfaced, tightening their grip and making it harder to breathe. Those who were still besieged were getting weaker mentally and physically, and they were finding it harder to cope with the sleep deprivation and constant levels of tension and alertness. In such situations, the main way we can offer support is by validating the person’s feelings; helping them find things they can control; and finding self-regulatory techniques that work, such as body relaxation or breathing techniques.
It became the eerie norm to receive text messages from people who had managed to come online in pauses between hiding in the shelter from bombs. However, none of us could get used to having to guess whether a delay in response meant the person had no network connection, or that they were no longer alive. Messages such as “I feel drained”, “I need an urgent vent call” and “I need to talk to someone, I feel it’s taken a toll on me” started to appear in our internal specialists’ support chats more often.
As a response to this, psychologists who specialise in supervision support started to organise webinars and video conferences in order to help each other work through the tension generated by the sessions. A group of dance movement therapists has recently launched a series of virtual meetups where they show how dance and movement can be used to cope with stress. I find such initiatives very important: if we burn out now, we won’t be able to help.
Messages such as this keep us going: “Thank you for helping me find the strength to let my husband go to war”; “Thank you for this talk, I needed to be heard. I found the courage to try and evacuate, and I’m in a safe place now.”
My grandma – the only grandparent still living – struggles to relive her wartime memories without tears. But she emphasises the importance of truth, especially during the times we’re living in, and of preserving these memories. Lately, my family and I have been spending hours on video calls with her as she shares them with us.
To honour my colleagues’ work I recently started a documentary project, taking their portraits via video calls. It feels important to make a record of this almost invisible part of war. When I publish the project later this year, I hope the war will be over. But a huge volume of trauma repair work is still to be done.

Russia has halted providing natural gas to neighbouring Finland, which has angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership, after the Nordic country refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles.
Gazprom Export has demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but Finland refuses to do so.
“Gas imports through Imatra entry point have been stopped,” Gasgrid Finland said in a statement. Imatra is the entry point for Russian gas into Finland.
Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum on Friday said Gazprom had warned that flows would be halted from 0400 GMT on Saturday morning. Gasum also confirmed on Saturday that the flows had stopped.
“Natural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum’s supply contract have been cut off,” it said in a statement.
“Starting from today, during the upcoming summer season, Gasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline.”Balticconnector links Finland to neighbouring Estonia’s gas grid.
Gazprom Export on Friday said flows would be cut because Gasum had not complied with the new Russian rules requiring settlement in roubles.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but gas only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption.
Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied for Nato membership, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow has warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
Most European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow already cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms.
Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without.
“The Finnish gas system is in balance both physically and commercially,” Gasgrid said on Saturday.
Finland on Friday said it had agreed to charter a storage and regasification vessel from US based Excelerate Energy to help replace Russian supplies, starting in the fourth quarter this year.
The vessel turns supercooled, liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrives on ships, back into regular gas.

A class of children in Novyi Bykiv sat listening to their teacher, his voice competing with the sound of plastic sheets flapping in the window frames. Asked if they were happy to be back in school, the class of fifth-grade students chorused “Yes!” with genuine enthusiasm.
They may not have windows, electricity or textbooks yet, but lessons in this village east of Kyiv have been back under way for two weeks now, after a major cleanup operation following the departure of the Russian army.
Novyi Bykiv was one of a series of settlements occupied by the Russian army for a month as part of Vladimir Putin’s failed drive towards the capital from three directions. For a month the residents lived in terror, with summary executions and widespread looting part of life.
The school was the main Russian base in the village, and when the Guardian visited just after the Russian departure there were clothes, food and broken glass strewn across the floors, graffiti sprayed on the walls and messages left by the Russians on the blackboards.
The Russians launched BUK missiles from just outside the school, drawing Ukrainian artillery fire that blew out the school’s windows, destroyed much of the Russian hardware and eventually led to their retreat in the last days of March.
“It was an unbearable time; you walked along the street and saw people you knew to be well dressed and elegant and they were wearing rags, with red eyes and looking dazed,” said the headteacher, Natalia Vovk. “Back then I thought that was it, that we’d never been able to work here again, we’d never be able to bring life back to this place,” she said.
For the children, too, the occupation was a traumatic time, as they saw the adults helpless to protect their homes and loved ones from the Russian onslaught.
The cleanup process was long, tiring and unpleasant. One of the downstairs rooms at the school had been used as a hybrid toilet and barbers, and was littered with clumps of hair and piles of faeces. Everywhere there was shattered glass and other debris. Someone found a hand grenade in the basement.
By the beginning of May, enough had been repaired for lessons to resume. In some parts of Ukraine, schools are using distance learning, but the Russian army looted most of the houses in Novyi Bykiv, meaning neither teachers nor students have computers or tablets.
About 100 of the school’s 188 pupils now attend regularly for short school days. Many of the others are still abroad or in western Ukraine, having fled with their families.
A number of small charitable organisations and individuals contacted the school after reading the Guardian article in April detailing the destruction there, Vovk said. Someone sent six computers, which arrived recently by post and are being stored elsewhere until the school building has windows again to ensure they remain safe. Another donor has offered to pay for replacement textbooks, after the entire stock was destroyed in a fire during the occupation.
Locals have also pitched in. Someone donated a lawnmower to mow the grass in front of the building, as the Russians had looted the school’s mower. The school bus driver and the building manager were working on Thursday afternoon to rig up plastic coverings on more of the windows, until the money comes in for permanent replacements.
The war has disrupted schooling across Ukraine, even in the relatively safe western part of the country. More than 200 schools have been fully destroyed and hundreds more damaged, according to Ukraine’s education ombudsman Sergii Gorbachov. Even in the west, in schools with no bomb shelter the lessons have had to go online.
A recent survey of Ukrainian parents found that 75% said their children had shown signs of increased stress since the war started, with some of the most common symptoms being mood swings, nightmares, anxiety and panic attacks.
“Of course children have really suffered during these last months, and it’s really important to give them proper support,” said Yulia Serdyuk, a 35-year-old teacher and psychologist from Novyi Bykiv.
Serdyuk said she advised children to spend as much time as possible talking with their parents and with other children. She said it was important for children to be able to discuss what had happened in the past three months rather than bury the experiences, though in some cases extreme care was required.
“If something terrible happened to their parents then you have to approach these cases really delicately,” she said.
Serdyuk spent three weeks living under occupation in Novyi Bykiv, before deciding to leave with her daughter on 19 March, a terrifying ordeal that involved talking their way through Russian checkpoints and at one point hiding from an incoming artillery strike.
She spent a month in Poland, but as soon as she heard it was safe she returned to Novyi Bykiv. “They took good care of us there but I was so desperate to come back,” she said.
Ukrainian officials hope that eventually the vast majority of children who fled with their families will return. Authorities are in negotiations to allow those abroad to continue some Ukrainian education through distance learning, as well as attending school in the countries where they are temporarily based.
Another issue is the situation in the areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia, where teachers are undergoing “retraining” programmes and are expected to teach in Russian, using the Russian curriculum.
“We have an enormous amount of testimony from the occupied areas about teachers being forced to change curriculums, and in some cases headteachers being kidnapped, or at the very least replaced with other, less qualified people who are willing to collaborate,” Gorbachov said.
In Novyi Bykiv the teachers have done everything to remove signs of the Russian occupation, except in one classroom where they have left the messages scrawled on the blackboard untouched, as a reminder of those days.
“Do not bring shame on the memories of your fathers and grandfathers, they fought AGAINST Nazis,” says one message in chalk, echoing the distorted Russian propaganda narrative that the Russian mission in Ukraine is about “denazification”.
Vovk, whose mother is Russian and moved to Ukraine 40 years ago, said it was hard for her to understand the mentality of those Russians who had come to the village. She has long stopped speaking to her own family members in Russia.
“It’s just unthinkable what happened, how they could do this,” she said. “We all just hope our victory will come as soon as possible, and that they never come back here again.”"

Russia has taken control of the Azovstal steel plant, the country’s defence ministry said on Friday evening. Ukrainian soldiers had finally ended their defence of the site in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, he said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Ukrainian combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one called for their execution.
Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, Luhansk, as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. “They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as Mariupol,” he said in a video address late on Friday, adding the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
Twelve people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling in Severodonetsk, the regional governor said. Troops fired on a school in the eastern city,  killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, said the head of the Luhansk regional state administration, Serhiy Haidai.
At least seven people, including a child, have been injured in a Russian missile attack on the town of Lozova in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The missile had targeted “the newly renovated House of Culture” in Lozova, Zelenskiy said in a statement on social media.
Zelenskiy proposed a formal deal with the country’s allies to secure Russian compensation for damage its forces have caused during the war. Zelenskiy, who says Russia is trying to destroy as much of Ukraine’s infrastructure as it can, said such a deal would show nations planning aggressive acts that they would have to pay for their actions. “We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred,” he said in a video address on Friday.
G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.
Moody’s on Friday cut Ukraine’s debt rating for the second time in three months and lowered the outlook to negative due to the growing risk the Russian invasion will affect the nation’s debt sustainability. The US Congress on Thursday approved a $40bn aid package for Ukraine to help fight Russia and keep the government operating, adding to aid packages and loans from the IMF and World Bank. Zelenskiy said his government needs $7bn a month to keep its economy afloat, while Moody’s estimates Ukraine faces financing needs of around $50bn this year.
A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken of inside the plant, writing: “Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.”
Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, starting from Saturday. The Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Gasum said the taps would be turned off when its contract with Gazprom ended at 7am (0400 GMT). The move, which Russia has blamed on Finland’s refusal to pay in rubles, comes days after Finland and Sweden submitted a joint application for Nato membership.
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he would speak to Finland tomorrow regarding its bid to join Nato and maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and that he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow.
A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The US has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions on the Kremlin.
Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army."

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has disclosed that the UK has begun discussions with its international allies about sending modern weaponry to Moldova to protect it from Russia.
She said that she wants to see the country, which is to the south-west of Ukraine, “equipped to Nato standard.”
Moldova is not currently a Nato member and there are concerns that it could be a future target for Vladimir Putin after the Ukraine conflict.
In an interview with the Telegraph, Truss said: “I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard. This is a discussion we’re having with our allies.
“Putin has been absolutely clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia – and just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren’t successful it doesn’t mean he’s abandoned those ambitions.”
The UK, US, France and Germany have held talks about whether to sign a form of security guarantee for Ukraine to continue providing weaponry and support in the long term.
Truss added: “What we’re working on at the moment is a joint commission with Ukraine and Poland on upgrading Ukrainian defences to Nato standard. So we will scope out what that looks like, what the Ukrainians need. The question then is how do you maintain that over time?
“How do we ensure … that Ukraine is permanently able to defend itself and how do we guarantee that happens? That’s what we are working on at the moment.
“And that also applies to other vulnerable states such as Moldova. Because again, the threat is broader from Russia, we also need to make sure that they are equipped to Nato standards.”
Last month Moldova’s deputy prime minister warned that the country was facing “a very dangerous new moment” and said forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the break-away region of Transnistria.
Nicu Popescu said his government had seen “a dangerous deterioration of the situation” after grenade attacks on the “ministry of security” in the region. The attacks represented “a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region”, he said, adding that Moldova’s institutions had been put on high alert in response.
Fears are growing that Moldova and Transnistria could be drawn into the Ukraine conflict. The predominantly Russian-speaking region in eastern Moldova has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992 after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels.
Speaking before the attacks, a senior Russian commander said gaining control over southern Ukraine would help Russia link up with Transnistria, which shares a 453km (280-mile) border with Ukraine.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-07/ukraine-zelensky-calls-out-san-jose-san-diego-russia;2022-06-07;San Jose mayor snubs request to cut ties with Russian city - Los Angeles Times;"After getting blasted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week for maintaining ties with a Russian city that manufactures war rockets, a San Jose City Council member wants the city to reconsider its stance.
But San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said he has no second thoughts.
“I don’t work for Mr. Zelensky,‘’ Liccardo said when asked whether the city should revisit its previous position. He then pointed to a statement in which he said the council’s “anger must be directed against the Russian government, and not against the Russian people.”
During an address Friday at the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors, Zelensky called out San Jose, San Diego, Chicago, Portland, Ore., and Jacksonville, Fla., for not ending their sister-city relationships, arguing that “we should not let tyrants exploit their connections with the free world — any connections.”
He was particularly critical of San Jose’s relationship with Ekaterinburg, the fourth largest city in Russia and one where he said “some of the deadliest Russian rockets are made and manufactured.”
“What do those ties give to you?” Zelensky asked the mayors. “Probably nothing. But they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated even after the start of its war.”
World & Nation
The British launchers can strike targets 50 miles away, which Ukraine needs in its effort to ward off a complete Russian takeover of the Donbas.

Ukrainian cities and civilians have been subject to constant bombardment by the Russians since the war started in late February.

Sylvia Arenas, a member of the San Jose City Council, said she intends to re-introduce a proposal she made in March to end San Jose’s relationship with Ekaterinburg. Arenas ended up voting against her own proposal back then when she realized that the council wanted to maintain ties.
The council voted unanimously against severing the relationship and instead opted to send a letter to Ekaterinburg urging peace and showing support for those who chose to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
San Jose was just one of several Bay Area governments that debated whether to cut ties with Russia this year. Santa Clara County cut ties with its sister city, Moscow, in late March, while Livermore took the same route as San Jose and sent a letter to its sister city of Snezhinsk.
World & Nation
U.S. intelligence agencies have begun a review of how they judge the will and ability of foreign governments to fight.

In an interview, Arenas acknowledged that she voted against her proposal last time because the majority of the council was against it.
“I agreed to the letter because there was no other option,” she said of her decision.
But Zelensky’s remarks Friday seemingly changed her perspective.
“I think we need to heed the direction of those leaders as they know their country the best,” Arenas said, citing Zelensky’s concern that “what we’re doing is contributing to Russia not feeling the isolation.”
World & Nation
Numbers help tell the tale of the death, destruction and economic havoc caused by Europe’s worst armed conflict in decades.


The course of the war has also changed from when San Jose first voted on the issue, she added.
Although Liccardo doesn’t agree with Arenas’ effort to re-examine the sister-city relationship, the mayor’s statement said he’s reached out to senior White House staff and plans to work with them in identifying a city in Ukraine that San Jose can form a sister-city relationship with.
“In the final calculus, peace will likely only come to the region with regime change in Russia, which requires doing all that we can — including citizen diplomacy — to encourage Russian citizens to stand up for peace,” Liccardo said. “That requires that we keep lines of communication open.”
Sister city relationships are set up to promote the exchange of cultural ideas across the world. San Jose has a number of sister cities, including Dublin and San José, the capital of Costa Rica."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/sports/newsletter/2022-06-07/ukraine-wales-world-cup-soccer;2022-06-07;Soccer newsletter: Ukraine stands tall in defeat - Los Angeles Times;"Hello, and welcome to the weekly L.A. Times soccer newsletter. I’m Kevin Baxter, The Times’ soccer writer, and today we take a deep dive on MLS salaries, look at the World Cup preparations of the United States and Mexico, and offer a solution for Angel City’s scoring woes. But we start with Ukraine, which saw its longshot hopes of securing a World Cup berth get washed out in a rainy Cardiff City Stadium in a 1-0 loss to Wales on Sunday.
Fairy tales don’t always end the way we want them to, but for Ukraine the result was heartbreaking for several reasons. The loss was Ukraine’s first in World Cup qualifying and came in what might have been the team’s best game. Ukraine had the ball for more than an hour of the 90 minutes, outshot Wales 22-9, put nine of those shots on goal and completed 300 more passes.
But the only score came on Gareth Bale’s free kick in the 34th minute that appeared headed into the waiting gloves of Ukrainian goalkeeper Georgiy Bushchan when captain Andriy Yarmolenko tried to head the ball out of danger and instead redirected it past Bushchan and into the net.
Wales, gifted an own goal, spent much of the rest of the rainy evening bunkering in, keeping as many as nine men behind the ball and absorbing the relentless Ukrainian attack but never conceding.

“I don’t think we deserved to lose,” Ukraine’s Oleksandr Zinchenko told Sky Sports. “But that’s football. It happens.”

The game was much bigger than a soccer match because the Ukrainians were playing for people back home who continue to suffer more than 100 days after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Days earlier, Ukraine had beaten Scotland to advance to the playoff final against Wales. The winner would head to Qatar this fall to open the World Cup against the United States.
For the Ukrainians, playing on the road for the second time in four days against a well-rested team, a victory would have provided a monumental morale boost — one that just eluded them.
“There is a dead silence in the locker room,” Ukrainian coach Oleksandr Petrakov said afterward.
Petrakov is a perfect example of the pluck, spirit and determination of the Ukrainians, who have risen to the occasion in both war and soccer.
In the early hours of the invasion, Petrakov asked to join the territorial defense force, but, at age 64 and with no combat experience, he was turned away. So he fought for his country’s sovereignty on the soccer field instead.

His own playing career was undistinguished and consisted mostly of stints with lower-division clubs — and even a few games with a Soviet military team. After taking over the Ukrainian national team last August, he showed few signs of the kind of graceful leadership he soon would be forced to exhibit.
He got his players to focus as much as possible on the game and not the war while winning friendlies against clubs from Germany and Italy and playing to a draw with a Croatian team before the win over Scotland left them a win away from the country’s second World Cup berth and first in 16 years.
That only ratcheted up the pressure.
“Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine ... and we need to show the performances of our lives,” Zinchenko said before the match against Wales. “We dream as a team to be in the World Cup.”
None of that was lost on the Welsh, who repeatedly stressed their solidarity with Ukraine — with the exception of a 90-minute period Sunday.
Wales manager Robert Page admitted to the BBC that “most of the world want Ukraine to get through,” but Wales, the third-oldest national team in the world, had its own dream too. It hasn’t been to a World Cup since 1958.
“Opportunities like this don’t come around every day,” Page said. “If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we’d do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we’ll want to win that game.
“Business is business.”
Page — the caretaker manager for Ryan Giggs, who has been away from the team as he deals with allegations of assault — rolled the dice on one decision Sunday, and the gamble paid off handsomely when the aging Wayne Hennessey, who started just seven games in goal for his club teams the last three years, played superbly, making nine saves.
“That’s the best game I’ve had in a Welsh shirt,” he confessed.
Added Bale, the team captain: “The result is the greatest in Welsh football history. We’re going to a World Cup. It means everything. [It’s] what dreams are made of.”
For Ukraine, which must prepare for Wednesday’s Nations League match against Ireland, its third game in eight days, it’s the kind of loss that builds character. And Petrakov again displayed that by stepping up to take the blame for the loss.
“I have no complaints about my players,” he said. “Pour everything on the head coach. The team wins, the head coach loses.”
“We did everything that we could,” he continued. “I really want the people of Ukraine to remember our efforts.”
In its release of league-wide salary figures last month, the MLS Players Association touted the continued double-digit growth in the average base salary for non-designated players on the senior roster. Pay for players in that category jumped to $438,728 in 2022, an increase of nearly $41,000. And salaries for players in roster spots four through 18 grew on average more than 10% per year over the last five years.
Which is all great for the players and the league’s continued well-being. Those, however, are not the numbers many fans examine . Here are some other numbers that, when you break them down, provide a pretty good hint at who’s spending wisely … and who’s just spending.
Let’s start with overall payroll, one of the only statistics in which the Galaxy lead the Western Conference:
Atlanta, $20.999 million
Galaxy, $20.528 million
Miami, $18.882 million
New England, $18.141 million
Chicago, $17.645 million
Seattle, $16.983 million
New York City, $15.543
Toronto, $15.213 million
Dallas, $15.031 million
Columbus. $14.978 million
LAFC, $14.563 million
Cincinnati, $13.789 million
Austin, $13.754 million
Kansas City, $13.631 million
Minnesota, $13.240 million
Montreal, $12.920 million
DC United, $12.483 million
Vancouver, $11.946 million
Philadelphia, $11.808 million
New York Red Bulls, $11.726 million
Nashville, $11.710 million
Houston, $11.548 million
San Jose, $11.541 million
Orlando, $11.509 million
Colorado, $11.390 million
Portland, $11.311 million
Charlotte, $10.708 million
Salt Lake, $10.477 million
With Javier “Chicharito” Hernández guaranteed $6 million in the final season of his three-year contract, the Galaxy also have the best-paid player in the conference.
Highest-paid players
(guaranteed compensation)
Xherdan Shaqiri, Chicago, M, $8.153 million
Chicharito, F, Galaxy, $6 million
Gonzalo Higuaín, Miami, F, $5.793 million
Alejandro Pozuelo, Toronto, M, $4.693 million
Jozy Altidore, New England, F, $4.264 million
Josef Martínez, Atlanta, F, $4.141 million
Carlos Vela, LAFC, F, $4.050 million
Luis Araujo, Atlanta, F, $3.941 million
Lucas Zelarayan, Columbus, M, $3.7 million
Gil Carles, New England, M, $3.545 million
So what does it all mean? Soccer America did its own analysis and drew some interesting conclusions — one of which was that LAFC general manager John Thorrington had an excellent winter.
Thorrington managed to acquire seven MLS veterans through trades or free agency and squeeze them under the league salary cap. All have contributed to a quick start that has LAFC (9-3-2) atop the Supporters’ Shield standings a season after failing to make the playoffs.
Here are the seven new players:
1. Kellyn Acosta, $1,215,000
2. Ilie Sanchez, $1,150,000
3. Ismael Tajouri-Shradi, $647,860
4. Franco Escobar, $550,000
5. Doniel Henry, $403,000
6. Ryan Hollingshead, $393,750
7. Maxime Crepeau, $302,500
Paul Kennedy, Soccer America’s Hall of Fame editor, crunched the numbers even further to show what a club’s spending says about its philosophy and success.
Take the Chicago Fire, for example. The team has the highest-paid player in MLS history in Swiss forward Xherdan Shaqiri, 30, who is guaranteed more than $8.1 million this season. The team spent another $8 million on the transfer fee but has gotten just three goals and six assists in 12 games for its largess.
Chicago has the fifth-highest payroll in the league, but nearly 46% of that money is going to Shaqiri. As a result, just seven other Fire players make more than $300,000 a year, the fewest on any roster in the league. Not surprisingly, Chicago (2-7-5) has the worst record in the league.
Compare that with New York City, the reigning MLS champion and current Eastern Conference leader, which has spread its spending around. The team has a league-high 12 players making guaranteed compensation at or above the 2022 maximum salary budget charge.
The top dozen salaries on NYCFC’s books:
1. Thiago Martins, $1.962 million
2. Maxi Moralez, $1.3 million
3. Talles Magno, $1.198 million
4. *Alexandru Mitrita, $1.15 million
5. Taty Castellanos (2019 transfer), $1.076 million
6. Heber, $914,000
7. Alexander Callens, $814,000
8. Anton Tinnerholm, $800,000
9. Maxime Chanot, $700,000
10. Alfredo Morales, $662,250
11. Gabriel Pereira, $624,500
12. Santiago Rodriguez, $612,500

With Wales’ victory over Ukraine, the United States learned Sunday who it will play in its World Cup opener in Qatar. Then hours later, it fought Uruguay, the No. 13 team in the FIFA rankings, to a scoreless draw. It was the team’s second friendly of the June window against a World Cup qualifier. In the first game, it beat No. 24 Morocco 3-0.
“We talked about wanting to keep progressing, keep moving forward as a group,” said manager Gregg Berhalter, who was missing his first-choice goalkeeper in Zack Steffen and one of his top center backs in Miles Robinson.
“We played two games against World Cup opponents and didn’t give up a goal. There are positives to it.”
The U.S. will play Grenada on Friday and El Salvador on June 14 in group play of the CONCACAF Nations League before resuming its World Cup preparations in September in Europe.
“The idea is to play quality teams,” said Berhalter, whose team extended its unbeaten streak at home to 25 matches, one short of the record, with Sunday’s draw in Kansas City, Kan. “You want into go in the World Cup with confidence that you can beat anyone on any given day.”
Uruguay outshot the U.S. 12-9, but goalkeeper Sean Johnson came up with three saves, including a goal-line stop of Darwin Nuñez’s left-footed shot in the 63rd minute. That was the best scoring opportunity for either team on the day.
In the Morocco game, the U.S. got first-half goals from Brenden Aaronson and Tim Weah and a second-half, penalty-kick goal from Haji Wright in his international debut. Morocco peppered the U.S. net with 22 shots and forced Matt Turner to make eight saves to earn his 12th shutout in his 17th appearance.
The game, played in Cincinnati, also marked the return of Weston McKennie, who missed the final three World Cup qualifiers after breaking a bone in his left foot in February.
“Now it’s full steam ahead, concentrating on Wales,” Berhalter said.
The road ahead could be a little bumpier for Mexico, which failed to score in either of its two June friendlies. El Tri lost to Uruguay 3-0 in Glendale, Ariz., before playing Ecuador to a scoreless draw in Chicago. Mexico has been blanked in five of nine games and three of its last four, the exception a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in which one of Mexico’s scores came on an own goal.
El Tri has scored just one goal of its own in the last 407 minutes dating to the first half of its final World Cup qualifier in March. And that goal came on a penalty kick.
All of which has turned up the heat on manager Tata Martino, who said his team is not ready for Qatar.
“This is part of the preparation, and in the preparation, as has happened in the last four years, there are good and difficult moments,” Martino said. “Obviously, if I were convinced that this can’t be corrected, we wouldn’t be talking.”
Mexico, which lacked for creativity, managed just 19 shots and put just four on target in the two games combined. Uruguay, by way of comparison, had four shots on target, and three of them went in.
The Ecuador game at Soldier Field also was marred by the return of an anti-gay chant in the final minutes that caused Panamanian referee Oliver Vergara to halt the match. Players from both teams gathered in the center circle until Vergara allowed play to resume after a brief pause.
Mexico will face Suriname and Jamaica in Nations League group play this month before resuming its World Cup preparations in September.

Speaking of teams that are having trouble scoring, Angel City was shut out for the third time in six matches and saw its scoreless streak grow to 200 consecutive minutes in Friday night’s 3-0 road loss to the Portland Thorns.
But there might be a simple answer to the team’s scoring woes: Tobin Heath.
The two-time World Cup and Olympic champion is in Southern California and out of contract after her season with Arsenal ended early because of a hamstring injury. Her 2021 season with Manchester City also ended early because of knee and ankle injuries.
But if Heath, 34, can get healthy, Angel City would do well to sign her because she could provide the offensive spark the team has been missing six games into a season in which it has scored just four times. Heath, who has been visible around Banc of California Stadium since returning from England, also could provide the key to unlocking Christen Press, her teammate with the Pali Blues, the U.S. women’s national team and Manchester United. Press has scored just once despite taking a team-high 16 shots, including seven on goal.
To get Heath, Angel City (3-3-0) first would have to outbid the OL Reign to obtain her NWSL rights from Racing Louisville, which traded away its claim to Press last August in exchange for Angel City’s first-round pick in the 2022 draft, $75,000 in allocation money and full roster protection in the expansion draft.
When Angel City first expressed an interest in Press, it was believed it would be a package deal, but team executives at the time said they were interested only in Press and gave her a three-year deal worth just less than $700,000, at the time the richest contract in NWSL history. Heath signed with Arsenal 11 days later.
Racing Louisville President James O’Connor said he has had “dialogue” with Heath’s agent about the player’s future. The Reign also have expressed interest.
“I think they’re trying to figure out what the next step is for them. I think they maybe have their own idea what they want to do,” said O’Connor, who added that when his team originally acquired the rights to Press and Heath, it partly was in the hopes they might be worth something in trade one day.
One rival NWSL club executive said a Heath-Press reunion in Los Angeles makes too much sense for it not to happen.
“Likely only going to one place,” the executive said of Heath.
Midfielder Catarina Macario, the brightest of a new generation of USWNT stars, will miss next month’s World Cup and Olympic qualifying tournament after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury that will require surgery. Macario, who led Lyon with 23 goals this season, was injured early in the team’s final game against FC Issy on Wednesday and could be out six months. She matched Mallory Pugh with a team-high five goals in as many games for the national team this year. … With his two goals in the Galaxy’s 4-1 victory over Austin last month, Dejan Joveljic is averaging a score every 75 minutes of playing time. That trails only Atlanta’s Dom Dwyer (every 68 minutes) among MLS players with at least three scores. But Joveljic also has two assists, meaning he has contributed to a score every 45 minutes.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-06-08/ukrainian-forces-could-pull-back-embattled-eastern-city;2022-06-09;"More bodies found in Mariupol, Ukraine; grain crisis grows - Los Angeles Times";"Workers pulled scores of bodies from smashed buildings in an “endless caravan of death” in the devastated city of Mariupol, authorities said Wednesday, while fears of a global food crisis escalated over Ukraine’s inability to export millions of tons of grain through its blockaded ports.
At the same time, Ukrainian and Russian forces battled fiercely for control of Severodonetsk, a city that has emerged as central to Moscow’s grinding campaign to capture Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.
As the fighting dragged on, the human cost of the war continued to mount. In many of Mariupol’s buildings, workers are finding 50 to 100 bodies each, according to a mayoral aide in the Russian-held port city in the south.
Petro Andryushchenko said on the Telegram app that the bodies are being taken in an “endless caravan of death” to a morgue, landfills and other places. At least 21,000 Mariupol civilians were killed during the weeks-long Russian siege, Ukrainian authorities have estimated.
The consequences of the war are being felt far beyond Eastern Europe because shipments of Ukrainian grain are bottled up inside the country, driving up the price of food.





Ukraine, long known as the “bread basket of Europe,” is one of the world’s biggest exporters of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, but much of that flow has been halted by the war and a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. An estimated 22 million tons of grain remains in Ukraine. The failure to ship it out is endangering the food supply in many developing countries, especially in Africa.

World & Nation
The British launchers can strike targets 50 miles away, which Ukraine needs in its effort to ward off a complete Russian takeover of the Donbas.




Russia has expressed support Wednesday for a U.N. plan to create a safe corridor at sea that would allow Ukraine to resume grain shipments.  The plan, among other things, calls for Ukraine to remove mines from the waters near the Black Sea port of Odesa.

But Russia is insisting that it be allowed to check incoming vessels for weapons. And Ukraine has expressed fear that clearing the mines could enable Russia to attack the coast. Ukrainian officials said the Kremlin’s assurances that it wouldn’t do that cannot be trusted.
European Council President Charles Michel on Wednesday accused the Kremlin of “weaponizing food supplies and surrounding their actions with a web of lies, Soviet-style.”
World & Nation
The Kremlin has largely kept mum about its plans for the Ukrainian cities, towns and villages it has captured, but long-term occupation looks likely.


While Russia, which is also a major supplier of grain to the rest of the world, has blamed the looming food crisis on Western sanctions against Moscow, the European Union heatedly denied that and said the blame rests with Russia itself for waging war against Ukraine.
“These are Russian ships and Russian missiles that are blocking the export of crops and grain,” Michel said. “Russian tanks, bombs and mines are preventing Ukraine from planting and harvesting.”
The West has exempted grain and other food from its sanctions against Russia, but the U.S. and the EU have imposed sweeping punitive measures against Russian ships. Moscow argues that those restrictions make it impossible to use its ships to export grain, and also make other shipping companies reluctant to carry its product.
Turkey has sought to play a role in negotiating an end to the war and in brokering the resumption of grain shipments. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Ukraine was not invited to the talks.
Meanwhile, Moscow’s troops continued their painstaking, inch-by-inch campaign for the Donbas region with heavy fighting in and around Severodonetsk, which had a prewar population of 100,000. It is one of the last cities yet to be taken by the Russians in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Severodonetsk the “epicenter” of the battle for the Donbas.
“This is a very fierce battle, very hard, perhaps one of the most difficult of the entire war,” he said in his nightly video address, which was recorded in the street outside his office in Kyiv.
He said the Ukrainian army is defending its positions and inflicting real losses on the Russian forces.
“In many ways, it is there that the fate of our Donbas is being decided,” Zelensky said.




Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai acknowledged the difficulties of battling Russian forces, saying, “Maybe we will have to retreat, but right now battles are ongoing in the city.”
“Everything the Russian army has — artillery, mortars, tanks, aviation — all of that, they’re using in Severodonetsk in order to wipe the city off the face of the Earth and capture it completely,” he said.
The city of Lysychansk, like Severodonetsk, is also wedged between Russian forces in Luhansk province.
Valentyna Tsonkan, an elderly resident of Lysychansk, described the moment  her house came under attack.
“I was lying on my bed. The shrapnel hit the wall and went through my shoulder,” she said as she received treatment for her wounds.


World & Nation
A Ukrainian couple have turned their farm into a sanctuary for all sorts of animals left behind during the war — and for some of their owners as well.


Russia’s continuing encroachment could open up the possibility of a negotiated settlement between the two nations more than three months into the war, analysts said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin “has the option of declaring his objectives met at more or less any time in order to consolidate Russia’s territorial gains,” said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the London think tank Chatham House. At that point, Giles said, Western leaders may “pressure Ukraine to accept their losses in order to bring an end to the fighting.”
Zelensky said Russia is unwilling to negotiate because it still feels strong.
Speaking by video link to U.S. corporate leaders, he called for even tougher sanctions to weaken Russia economically, including getting it “off the global financial system completely.”
Zelensky said Ukraine is willing to negotiate “to find a way out.” But a settlement cannot come “at the expense of our independence.”
Meanwhile, to the north, Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region killed five people and wounded 12 over a 24-hour period, Ukrainian authorities said.
The Russian military said it used high-precision missiles to hit an armor repair plant near Kharkiv. There was no confirmation from Ukraine of such a plant being hit."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-06-05/trumps-ukraine-impeachment-shadows-war-risks-gop-response;2022-06-05;Trump's Ukraine impeachment shadows war, risks GOP response - Los Angeles Times;"When former President  Trump was impeached in late 2019 after pressuring Ukraine’s leader for “a favor,” all while withholding $400 million in military aid to help confront Russia-backed separatists, even the staunchest defense hawks in the Republican Party stood virtually united by Trump’s side.
But as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military marched toward Kyiv in February, threatening not only Ukraine but the rest of Europe, Republicans and Democrats in Congress cast aside impeachment politics, rallied to Ukraine’s side and swiftly shipped billions to President Volodymyr Zelensky‘s defense.
The question ahead, as Ukrainians battle Russia’s grinding invasion now past its 100th day, is whether the rare bipartisanship on Capitol Hill is resilient enough to withstand Trump’s isolationist influences on his party or whether Republicans who yielded to Trump’s “America First” approach will do so again, putting military and humanitarian support for Ukraine at risk.
“Maybe there is a recognition on both Republican side and Democratic side that this security assistance is very important,” said Bill Taylor, a former ambassador to Ukraine, in a recent interview with the Associated Press.
“And maybe neither side is eager to crack that coalition.”
World & Nation
Putin warns that any Western deliveries of long-range rocket systems to Ukraine will prompt Moscow to hit ‘objects that we haven’t yet struck.’

The fraught party politics comes at a pivotal moment as the Russian invasion drags on and the United States gets deeper into the conflict before the November elections, when lawmakers face voters with control of Congress at stake.
A recent AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows public support in the U.S. for punishing Russia over the war is wavering if it comes at the expense of the economy.
While Congress mustered rare and robust bipartisan support to approve a $40-billion Ukraine package, bringing total U.S. support to a staggering $53 billion since the start of the war, opposition on the latest round of aid came solely from the Republican side, including from Trump.
That is a warning sign over the sturdiness of the bipartisan coalition that the top Republican in Congress, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, tried to shore up when he led a delegation of GOP senators to stand by Zelensky‘s side in a surprise trip to Kyiv last month.

“There is some isolationist sentiment in my party that I think is wrongheaded, and I wanted to push back against it,” McConnell told a Kentucky audience this past week, explaining his Ukraine visit.
The divisions within the GOP over Ukraine are routinely stoked by Trump, who initially praised Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “genius” negotiating strategy. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against the U.S. aid to Ukraine, including recently at a rally in Wyoming. Before the Senate vote on the $40 billion in assistance, Trump decried the idea of spending abroad while America’s “parents are struggling.”
As Trump considers whether to run for the White House in 2024, the persistence of his “America First” foreign policy approach leaves open questions about the durability of his party’s commitment to U.S. support for a democratic Ukraine. Senators are poised this summer to vote to expand NATO to include Sweden and Finland, but Trump has repeatedly criticized U.S. spending on the Western military alliance.
Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, among 11 Republican senators who voted against the Ukraine package, called the tally an “astronomical number” at a time when foreign policy should be focused elsewhere, including on China.
“That is nation-building kind of number,” Hawley said in an interview. “And I think it’s a mistake.”
It was nearly three years ago that Ukraine was at the center of U.S politics with the 2019 Trump impeachment proceedings that rocked Washington.
Zelensky, a comedian turned politician, had just been elected when he asked Trump during a July 25, 2019, phone call for a meeting to strengthen U.S.-Ukraine relations and ensure military aid, according to a transcript released by Trump’s White House.
“We are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes,” Zelensky told Trump, referring to anti-tank weaponry Ukraine relies on from the West.
Trump replied: “I would like you to do us a favor, though.”
Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a chief Democratic rival to Trump at the time and now the American president, and Biden’s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
The impeachment investigation, sparked by a government whistleblower’s complaint over Trump’s call, swiftly became a milestone, the first in a generation since Democrat Bill Clinton faced charges over an affair with a White House intern.
During weeks of impeachment proceedings over Ukraine, witnesses from across the national security and foreign service sphere testified under oath about the alarms that were going off in Washington and Kyiv about Trump’s conversation with Zelensky.
Complicated stories emerged about the scramble by Trump allies to secure the investigations of the Bidens — and of the civil servants pushing back against what they saw as a breach of protocol.
Yet American opinions over the gravity of the charges against Trump were mixed, polling at the time by the AP showed.
Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House and acquitted by the Senate, with just one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, joining Democrats to convict.
“The allegations were all horse hockey,” said Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), recalling his decision not to impeach.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) brushed back questions about whether Trump’s actions then played any role in Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in February.
“It wasn’t like Putin invaded right after. It’s been almost two years,” Rubio said.
Republicans are quick to remind that Trump was, in fact, the first president to allow lethal arms shipments to Ukraine — something President Obama’s administration, with Biden as vice president, declined to do over worries of provoking Putin.
Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the co-chair of the Senate’s Ukrainian Caucus who persuaded Trump in a phone call to ultimately release the $400 million in aid, stood by his decision not to convict Trump over the delay of that assistance.
“As long as it was done,” Portman said about the outcome.
But Romney said people need to remain “clear-eyed” about the threat Putin poses to the world order. “I did the right thing at the time, and I haven’t looked back,” he said.
Democrats are blistering in their criticism of Republicans over the impeachment verdict.
“It’s a shame,” said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
“Every single Republican who voted in support of Donald Trump’s geopolitical shakedown and blackmail of Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people should be ashamed of themselves,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) “because the consequences of Donald Trump’s actions were understood to us then, and now the world understands.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-07/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-winery-lawsuit-miraval-oligarch;2022-06-07;Brad Pitt invokes Ukraine in lawsuit against Angelina Jolie - Los Angeles Times;"Brad Pitt has put the weight of the war in Ukraine behind his Chateau Miraval winery lawsuit against ex-wife Angelina Jolie, filing an updated complaint Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Pitt first sued Jolie in February, alleging she illegally sold her shares in the winery and estate to Russian-expat vodka billionaire Yuri Shefler. Jolie used legal means to skirt an obligation to get Pitt’s approval of the deal, the complaint said. The Stoli-related Shefler and Alexey Oliynik were added as defendants to the complaint filed Friday.
In the new filing, Pitt’s attorneys state that despite Stoli’s attempts to distance itself from Russia, many supporters of Ukraine have associated the vodka brand with Russia and with Vladimir Putin’s military aggression against the smaller Eastern European nation. This association makes the Stoli brand dangerous to the Miraval Rosé brand, the lawsuit alleges.
“After years of celebrating — and profiting from — its Russian roots, Stoli has disclaimed all ties between itself and Russia. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Stoli has said it uses Latvia as its home base and has attempted to ‘rebrand’ by renaming ‘Stolichnaya’ vodka ‘Stoli,’” the lawsuit says. “But Stoli vodka is synonymous with Russia, as the countless images of consumers pouring Stoli vodka down the drain make clear.”
Entertainment & Arts
Brad Pitt wants Angelina Jolie’s sale of Chateau Miraval stake undone, a new lawsuit says, claiming a Russian oligarch is angling for winery control.

The complaint says later, “Despite Shefler’s desperate attempt to disassociate himself from the Putin regime, the Stoli brand is now a massive international liability. Continued association with Shefler thus poses serious commercial risk to Miraval — a risk that Pitt’s and Mondo Bongo’s contractual rights were designed to avoid. By subverting those rights, Jolie and Shefler have devalued the family business that Pitt has cultivated for over a decade.”
An attorney for Jolie did not respond immediately Tuesday to a request for comment.
The revised lawsuit cites a “Jolie-led conspiracy” to hurt both Pitt and the Miraval brand, echoing allegations made in the Feb. 17 complaint.
“Jolie pursued and then consummated the purported sale in secret, purposely keeping Pitt in the dark, and knowingly violating Pitt’s contractual rights,” the document says. “By doing so, Jolie sought to seize profits she had not earned and returns on an investment she did not make. Also through the purported sale, Jolie sought to inflict harm on Pitt. Jolie knew and intended that Shefler and his affiliates would try to control the business Pitt had built and to undermine Pitt’s investment in Miraval.”

Entertainment & Arts
California’s Supreme Court refuses to consider Brad Pitt’s appeal of a ruling that disqualified the judge in his custody battle with Angelina Jolie.

Since the sale, Miraval leadership has had to take “urgent measures to manage the hostile and commercial threat posed by Stoli’s claimed ownership interest,” the lawsuit says.
After Pitt’s team filed the revised lawsuit Friday, Stoli Group put out a press release Monday quoting Stoli Group Chief Executive Damian McKinney as saying that “the only role that Yuri Shefler plays is that of an investor” and denying any desire by the oligarch or the company to turn a 50% stake in the winery into a larger holding.
""[W]e own 50% of Miraval and what we want above all is to create a real added value from this partnership, as a couple of us will go further,” McKinney said in the release. “Our agreement with Brad Pitt is to make the castle a place where art and wine are one, with the most incredible of music studios.”
Pitt alleged in his original complaint — filed a week before the Russian invasion —  that since the deal went down, Pitt’s company and Shefler’s have been unable to agree on the management and strategic direction of the company that runs Chateau Miraval. Pitt also complained that he can no longer enjoy his private residence, as it is co-owned by strangers.
Movies
In an age where too many celebrities are famous for little more than being famous, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt occupy a spot in the Hollywood firmament matched only by the stars of yesteryear — Bogart and Bacall, Tracy and Hepburn, even Burton and Taylor.

The revised lawsuit, which also names companies SPI Holding Group Ltd. and Tenute del Mondo as defendants, alleges breach of implied-in-fact contract and tortious interference with contractual relations, among other things. Pitt is asking that the sale be undone and that he be awarded punitive and compensatory damages to be determined at a jury trial, as well as the repayment of his legal fees.
Pitt and Jolie were married at Chateau Miraval in 2014 after connecting in 2004 on the set of the movie “Mr. & Mrs. Smith.” Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-06-06/ukraine-russia-war-economy-refugee-aid;2022-06-06;Op-Ed: To pay for the war, Ukraine needs the EU’s help to restart its economy - Los Angeles Times;"Emmanuel Macron, president of France, last week expressed concern about not humiliating Vladimir Putin through a quick and comprehensive defeat in Ukraine. But he seems to have lost track of conditions on the ground.
The war will eventually come to an end and Russia will not achieve its goals, but it will be a long struggle. To maintain this effort — which requires paying for the costs of war — it’s imperative to restart the Ukrainian economy and generate more tax revenue, even as the fighting carries on.
The good news is that the European Union, the United States and other allies have already committed substantial resources to support Ukrainians, including when they leave the country as refugees. What is needed now is to adjust how those resources are deployed, to encourage these refugees to return home when it is safe to do so. This will help the Ukrainian economy and strengthen government finances.
In the weeks after Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, a large proportion of the local population either moved westward within Ukraine and or left the country entirely. This was completely understandable given the anticipated violence. Subsequent missile attacks on civilians, the deliberate targeting of places sheltering children, and the horrors that happened in Bucha, Irpin and other places confirmed everyone’s worst fears.
More than 6.5 million Ukrainians escaped the country and found amazing support in neighboring countries, including EU countries, as well as non-EU countries such as Moldova and Norway. Taking care of refugees is expensive — they need food, shelter, schooling, healthcare and other services. Many countries have also provided daily cash allowances. Part of this cost has been borne with great generosity by individuals, but the budgetary cost to EU governments associated with taking care of more than 6 million refugees is at least 60 billion euros per year (about 10,000 euros per person).
Some of these refugees can work while outside Ukraine. The information technology and telecoms infrastructure of the country remains strong, despite Russia’s efforts to destroy these systems. As a result, people who can work remotely are able to earn income and, even more important, keep the Ukrainian insurance, finance, customer service and other economic activities on their feet.
But many jobs in an economy such as Ukraine’s cannot be done remotely, and there is also a pressing need to rebuild roads, bridges, apartments and commercial buildings. The weather is currently good for construction, but this will not last long — within six months rain and cold will make it much harder to rebuild. Overall, on its current course, the economy is likely to decline by at least 40% this year compared with 2021 and, until the refugees return home, a sustained recovery is hard to achieve.
There is already a steady flow of at least 30,000 people returning to Ukraine per day. They and many more Ukrainians can be productively employed to rebuild and repair the economy, but the government is hard-pressed to support them and their wages. The government budget is already running a monthly deficit of around 5 billion euros to cover war-related spending.

That’s why it would make sense to have some of the EU financial support for refugees made available to them when they return to Ukraine.
There are three potential ways to make this transfer. One approach is to let refugees bring their cash benefits back with them to Ukraine for a limited period, such as six months. Another is to provide additional resources to the Ukrainian government to hire more people for rebuilding work. Both these policies will pull more refugees home, but the process may be slow.
Easier and more effective would be for the Ukrainian government to use this funding, received from the EU, to create a temporary basic income program for all Ukrainians in the country. A modest cash grant program would help millions now struggling to feed their families stay in their communities and increase economic activity.
If half of the more than 6 million Ukrainian refugees were to return home, European governments could significantly reduce their refugee spending and redirect tens of billions of euros into uses that would have long-term benefits for Ukraine. Any such program could be wound down as Russian forces are expelled from Ukrainian territory and the economy stabilizes.
We don’t know how long this war will last. The devastation wrought by Russia’s invasion remains incalculable. Eventually, Ukraine, a country of around 40 million, will need international assistance and support to rebuild. Shoring up its economy and beginning that process should start now.

“If the international community continues its support, I believe Ukraine can win” its war against Russia, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in a statement.
The statement came after comments Sunday by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned the West against sending longer-range rocket systems to Ukraine.
The British government described the M270 weapon system as a “cutting edge” military asset that can strike targets up to 50 miles away “with pinpoint accuracy.” Britain pledged last week to send the weapons but gave no details about delivery dates.
The U.S. last week announced plans to deliver $700 million in security assistance for Ukraine, including four precision-guided, medium-range rocket systems, as well as helicopters, Javelin antitank systems, radars, tactical vehicles and more.
Washington and London hope that the deliveries will help Ukraine turn the tide of the war in its eastern Donbas region, which Russia appears intent on capturing entirely.
World & Nation
U.S. intelligence agencies have begun a review of how they judge the will and ability of foreign governments to fight.

They are unlikely to have an immediate effect, however. The Pentagon said last week that it would take at least three weeks to get the U.S. weapons onto the battlefield. Russia-backed separatists have fought the Ukrainian government since 2014 in the Donbas.

The U.S. has stopped short of offering Ukraine longer-range weapons that could fire deep into Russia and inflame Washington’s tensions with Moscow.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the West that, if it provided Ukraine with long-range rockets, Moscow would respond by taking over larger areas of Ukraine.
Speaking during an online news conference Monday, Lavrov said that “the longer the range of weapons you supply, the farther away the line from where neo-Nazis could threaten the Russian Federation will be pushed.” Moscow says it’s fighting against neo-Nazis in Ukraine — a false claim derided by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust.

Ukraine’s struggle was at the forefront of comments by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley and was in the minds of World War II veterans of D-Day who gathered in Normandy in northern France on Monday.
“The fight in Ukraine is about honoring these veterans of World War II,” Milley said at the American Cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, overlooking Omaha Beach.
“It’s about maintaining the so-called global rules-based international order that was established by the dead who are buried here at this cemetery,” he said.
American D-Day veteran Charles Shay, 97, was at Omaha Beach in Normandy to mark the 78th anniversary of the June 6, 1944, landings that ultimately resulted in the liberation of Europe from Nazi domination.

“In 1944, I landed on these beaches and we thought we’d bring peace to the world. But it’s not possible,” he added with regret.
Lavrov attacked the refusal to let his plane fly into Serbia on Sunday as “cynical” and “unthinkable.” Reports said that Serbia’s neighbors, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro, had refused to allow Lavrov’s plane to fly through their airspace to reach Serbia.
“A sovereign state has been deprived of its right to conduct foreign policies,” he said.
He blamed NATO allies — with whom Moscow is at loggerheads — for engineering the flight ban, saying it revealed that the main purpose of the alliance’s expansion is to try to isolate Russia.

Numbers help tell the tale of the death, destruction and economic havoc caused by Europe’s worst armed conflict in decades.

Russia’s own use of missiles in Ukraine, meanwhile, continued to pummel targets, with the Russian military claiming Monday that it had struck a Ukrainian factory involved in repairing armored vehicles.
Russian warplanes fired long-range missiles to destroy the plant on the edge of the town of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said.
Russian aircraft hit 73 areas of concentration of Ukrainian troops and equipment, while the Russian artillery struck 431 military targets, Konashenkov said. His claims couldn’t be independently verified.
Putin vowed to strike deeper into the heart of Ukraine if the West sends Kyiv longer-range missile systems. In a show of force, Russian missiles struck Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, on Sunday.

Ukraine’s General Staff said Russian forces fired five X-22 cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea toward Kyiv, and one was destroyed by air defenses. Four other missiles hit “infrastructure facilities,” but Ukraine said there were no casualties.
Before Sunday’s early-morning attack, Kyiv hadn’t faced any such Russian airstrikes since the April 28 visit of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Zelensky on Sunday visited command posts and the front line positions of Ukrainian troops in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which make up the Donbas.
A Ukrainian regional governor said Monday that the situation in a key eastern town has worsened for defending troops.
Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Monday that fierce fighting was continuing in the city of Severodonetsk, which is at the epicenter of the Russian offensive.
He described the combat situation as “quite dynamic,” adding that Ukrainian forces had lost some of the gains they made over the weekend but were holding their positions in the city’s industrial zone.
“Our defenders managed to conduct a counteroffensive and free nearly half of the city, but the situation has worsened again now,” Haidai told the Associated Press.
“The shelling of Severodonetsk has intensified — [the Russians] are destroying everything in line with their scorched-earth tactics,” he said.

A Ukrainian couple have turned their farm into a sanctuary for all sorts of animals left behind during the war — and for some of their owners as well.

The Russians “have an enormous amount of equipment and personnel. They have pulled up a lot of reserves,” he added.
Russian forces have been focusing on the capture of the two cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk along the banks of the strategic Seversky Donets River.
West of those cities, in the towns of Slovyansk and Bakhmut, cars and military vehicles have been speeding into town from the direction of the front line. Dozens of military doctors and paramedic ambulances worked Sunday to evacuate civilians and Ukrainian servicemen, many of whom had been hurt by artillery shelling.
Western military intelligence reports say Ukrainian counterattacks in Severodonetsk are probably halting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained by concentrating their combat units and firepower in the area."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-06-03/100-days-russia-ukraine-war-by-the-numbers;2022-06-03;At 100 days, Russia-Ukraine war by the numbers - Los Angeles Times;"One hundred days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war has brought the world gut-wrenching scenes nearly every day: civilian corpses in the streets of Bucha, a blown-up theater in Mariupol, the chaos at a Kramatorsk train station in the wake of a Russian missile strike.
Those images tell just a part of the overall picture of Europe’s worst armed conflict in decades. Here’s a look at some numbers and statistics that — while in flux and at times uncertain — shed further light on the death, destruction, displacement and economic havoc wrought by the war as it reaches this milestone with no end in sight.

Nobody knows exactly how many combatants or civilians have died, and claims of casualties by government officials — who may be exaggerating or lowballing their figures for public relations reasons — are all but impossible to verify.
Government officials, United Nations agencies and others who carry out the grim task of counting the dead don’t always get access to places where people were killed.
And Moscow has released scant information about casualties among its forces and allies, and given no accounting of civilian deaths in areas under its control. In some places — such as the long-besieged city of Mariupol, potentially the war’s biggest killing field — Russian forces are accused of trying to cover up deaths and dumping bodies into mass graves, clouding the overall toll.
With all those caveats, “at least tens of thousands” of Ukrainian civilians have died so far, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday in comments to Luxembourg’s parliament.
World & Nation
The near-total capture of Severodonetsk, on the Seversky Donets River, is another steppingstone in Russia’s bid to occupy eastern Ukraine.

In Mariupol alone, officials have reported more than 21,000 civilian deaths. Severodonetsk, a city in the eastern region of Luhansk that has become the focus of Russia’s offensive, has seen about 1,500 deaths, according to the mayor.

Such estimates comprise both those killed by Russian strikes or troops and those who succumbed to secondary effects such as hunger and sickness as food supplies and health services collapsed.
Zelensky said this week that 60 to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying in combat every day, with about 500 more wounded.
Russia’s last publicly released figures for its own forces came March 25, more than two months ago, when a general told state media that 1,351 soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded.
Ukraine and Western observers say the real numbers, then and now, are much higher: Zelensky said Thursday that more than 30,000 Russian servicemen have died — “more than the Soviet Union lost in 10 years of the war in Afghanistan.” In late April, the British government estimated Russian losses at 15,000.

Roberto Marquez saw footage of Ukrainians fleeing Kyiv. He decided to travel across the world to paint the scene.

Speaking on condition of anonymity Wednesday to discuss intelligence matters, a Western official said Russia is “still taking casualties, but ... in smaller numbers.” The official estimated that some 40,000 Russian troops have been wounded.
In Moscow-backed separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine, authorities have reported more than 1,300 fighters lost and nearly 7,500 wounded in the Donetsk region, along with 477 dead civilians and nearly 2,400 wounded, plus 29 civilians killed and 60 wounded in Luhansk.

Relentless shelling, bombing and airstrikes have reduced large swaths of many cities and towns to rubble.
Ukraine’s parliamentary commission on human rights says Russia’s military has destroyed almost 38,000 residential buildings, rendering about 220,000 people homeless.
Nearly 1,900 educational facilities from kindergartens to grade schools to universities have been damaged, including 180 destroyed.
Other infrastructure losses include 300 car and 50 rail bridges, 500 factories and about 500 damaged hospitals, according to Ukrainian officials.
The World Health Organization has tallied 296 attacks on hospitals, ambulances and medical workers in Ukraine this year.

A Ukrainian couple have turned their farm into a sanctuary for all sorts of animals left behind during the war — and for some of their owners as well.


The U.N. refugee agency estimates that about 6.8 million people have been driven out of Ukraine at some point during the conflict.
But since fighting subsided in the area near Kyiv and elsewhere, and Russian forces redeployed to the east and south, about 2.2 million have returned to the country, it says.
The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration estimates that as of May 23 there were more than 7.1 million internally displaced people — that is, those who fled their homes but remain in the country. That’s down from more than 8 million in an earlier count.

Ukrainian officials say that before the Feb. 24 invasion, Russia controlled some 7% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014, and areas held by the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. On Thursday, Zelensky said Russian forces now held 20% of the country.
While the front lines are constantly shifting, that amounts to an additional 22,000 square miles under Russian control, a total area slightly larger than Croatia or a little smaller than the state of West Virginia.

The West has levied a host of retaliatory sanctions against Moscow, including on the crucial oil and gas sectors, and Europe is beginning to wean itself from its dependence on Russian energy.
Evgeny Gontmakher, academic director of European Dialogue, wrote in a paper this week that Russia faces more than 5,000 targeted sanctions, the most of any country. Some $300 billion of Russian gold and foreign exchange reserves in the West have been frozen, he added, and air traffic in the country dropped from 8.1 million to 5.2 million passengers between January and March.

The MOEX Russia stock index has plunged by about a quarter since just before the invasion and is down nearly 40% from the start of the year. And the Russian Central Bank said last week that annualized inflation came in at 17.8% in April.
Ukraine has reported a staggering economic blow: 35% of GDP wiped out by the war.
“Our direct losses today exceed $600 billion,” Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky’s office, said recently.
Ukraine, a major agricultural producer, says it has been unable to export some 22 million tons of grain. It blames a backlog of shipments on Russian blockades or capture of key ports. Zelensky accused Russia this week of stealing at least a half-million tons of grain during the war.

The fallout has rippled around the globe, further driving up costs for basic goods on top of inflation that was in full swing in many places before the invasion.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has pushed up already high fertilizer prices and made scarce supplies even harder to find, especially in the developing world.

Crude oil prices in London and New York have risen by 20% to 25%, resulting in higher prices at the pump and for an array of petroleum-based products.
Developing countries are being squeezed particularly hard by higher costs of food, fuel and financing, according to economist Richard Kozul-Wright of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
Wheat supplies have been disrupted in African nations, which imported 44% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine before the war.

Ukraine will qualify for its first World Cup in 16 years with a win over Wales on Sunday, an emotional lift for the country invaded by Russia.

The specter of the war was evident in the Welsh capital with a message of peace in English and Ukrainian on the screens in the Cardiff City Stadium. Rivalries were put aside when the Ukrainian national anthem was played and it was applauded by the home fans.
Of the 1,800-seat allocation for Ukraine, 100 free tickets were given to refugees who have been forced to flee Ukraine since the invasion began in February, which led to Russia being disqualified from World Cup qualifying.

Ukrainian ambulances carry the wounded and dead from the battlefield, sharing the road with rumbling tanks.
Detonations sound in the distance as lost souls adrift in this ghost city line up for giveaways of food and medicine.
“Soon, the shelling will come here,” predicts Serhii Barkov, 38, his left arm still bandaged from wounds sustained during Russian bombardment of his eastern Ukraine village, Studenok. “Once the shelling starts, you just run wherever your eyes can see,” he says, nervously dragging on a cigarette outside the hospital. “Things will get worse here in a few days. I need to leave.”
For Ukraine, the war has taken a dark, edgy turn in the Donbas, the vast swath of farm towns, coal pits and smokestack cities that forms much of the country’s eastern border with Russia. Divided since 2014 between Ukraine and pro-Russia separatists, the Donbas — home to more than 4 million before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 — appears in danger of falling completely to Moscow.

Here’s everything you need to know about the California primary election. How and where to vote. Who are the candidates and what are the issues?

The process could take weeks or months: No decisive breakthrough seemed imminent as the war entered its 100th day  this week. Ukrainian commanders still express hope of turning the tide, while engaging in counteroffensives in the south, near the Russian-controlled city of Kherson, and in the northeast outside the city of Kharkiv. But the momentum in the east has clearly shifted under a relentless hail of Russian artillery.
Ukrainian forces that repelled Moscow’s attacks on the country’s two most populous cities — Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv — are now decidedly on the defensive here.
President Biden’s announcement this week  that Washington was providing advanced rocket systems to Ukraine has bolstered some hopes for a battlefield turnaround. The Pentagon had previously sent more than 100 long-range howitzers.
The Kremlin said the arms transfers amount to “pouring fuel on the fire,” constituting a proxy war meant to weaken Russia.
But it is unclear to what extent, if any, that the slew of new weapons will disrupt the Russian onslaught.
“I wouldn’t say that’s a game-changer,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, an analyst at CNA,  a research group based in Arlington, Va.
“I think the Russians will feel it. But it’s not going to suddenly reverse Russian gains,” added Edmonds, a former director for Russia on the White House National Security Council.
Despite reports of dispirited Russian troops, obsolete equipment and a sclerotic command structure, Moscow appears to have seized the advantage in the eastern region — at least for now.
“What we are seeing is the beginning of a tide that is turning in Russia’s direction in terms of a war of attrition,” said Jonathan Eyal, associate director of the Royal United Services Institute, a British security think tank. “[Moscow] has taken on a narrowed task of not trying to overwhelm Ukraine.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin initially sought to topple Ukraine’s government in a few days and install a puppet leader in Kyiv. Now, those aspirations appear to have been scaled back to a land grab that can be touted as triumph to the Russian masses and the country’s compliant media.
At this point, Russia controls some 20% of Ukrainian territory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Luxembourg lawmakers in a video appearance Thursday.  That is up from about 7% of Ukraine territory under Russian domination before the Feb. 24 invasion, including Crimea and parts of the Donbas ruled by pro-Russia separatists. Ukraine will never accept the Russian occupation, Zelensky insists. On the other hand, the prospects seem slim that Russia will ever return the land back to Ukraine.
Whether that fundamental impasse about the disputed territories will be resolved — through military force, negotiation or some other means — remains perhaps the major question mark of this grueling conflict.
The war in the east is a protracted, World War I-style slog based largely on artillery fire, dubbed the “God of War” by none other than Josef Stalin. Gone are the lumbering columns of tanks plodding through enemy territory that stretched supply lines and proved vulnerable to ambush in Russia’s disastrous attack on Kyiv at the beginning of the invasion.
Russia’s subsequent focus on the Donbas, largely waged from pro-Moscow separatist enclaves — and showcasing battle-hardened Ukrainian allies fighting on home terrain — represents a kind of return to Soviet-era military doctrine. It’s not new-age warfare: Deliberate ground advances follow scorched-earth artillery barrages that soften opposition targets, decimating not only the Ukrainian military but civilian homes, shops, infrastructure and anything else in the Russian troops’ path.

“This is the traditional Soviet and Russian approach: You concentrate a lot of firepower in a small place and you keep going until you destroy your opponent,” said Eyal. “There’s a large amount of blood expended on these rather miserable victories that Russia can claim for its own.”
With neither side in the conflict providing regular casualty updates, the toll in deaths and injuries remains opaque.
“Tens of thousands” of civilians have been killed, Zelensky told the Luxembourg parliament Thursday.  A day earlier, he told Newsmax, the far-right American cable news channel, that between 60 and 100 Ukrainian soldiers are lost on the battlefield each week. An additional 500 are wounded, he said.
Last month, Russia won its biggest victory of the war by overcoming the last defenders of the port city of Mariupol — long a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Its capitulation, accompanied by images of bedraggled Ukrainian fighters surrendering after months holed up in a metalworks, was a strategic and propaganda coup for the Kremlin.
Mariupol is part of Donetsk province, which, along with adjoining Luhansk, make up the Donbas. The southern city’s capture completes a land corridor from Russian-held areas in the Donbas to the Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russian in 2014.
Some 165 miles northeast of Mariupol, Russian forces have now almost completely overrun their next major target: the industrial city of Severodonetsk, which since 2014 has served as Ukraine’s administrative hub for Luhansk province. Intense shelling has already driven off most residents and left much of the city in ruins, just like Mariupol. Opposing forces have been engaged in street fighting amid the wreckage. The imminent fall of Severodonetsk also threatens Lysychansk, which sits across the Seversky Donets River.
Losing the twin cities would mean that Russia in effect controls the entirety of Luhansk.
Meanwhile, Russia has already accelerated attacks in the direction of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, the two main cities in Donetsk province still under Ukrainian government control.
For more than a month, Russian troops have engaged in shaping operations, attacking villages with indiscriminate artillery barrages outside Severodonetsk with the aim of choking off supply routes for the military and civilian populations.
The Russians’ sheer numerical superiority, both in troops and materiel, means that a takeover is usually not a matter of if, but when. “They never stop firing,” said one Ukrainian soldier stationed near the town of Lyman before it fell into Russian hands last month.

The unyielding campaign has transformed once-thriving communities into vast debris fields.
Rubizhne was a quaint city of more than 50,000 outside Severodonetsk until Putin’s forces invaded.
The onslaught began in April. Artillery duels ensued over Rubizhne. That gave way to street battles. Ukrainian defenders bunkered in a pharmaceutical plant before finally retreating over a bridge to Severodonetsk. They then blew up the span to slow their pursuers.
A video from a Ukrainian National Guard drone shows the aftermath: Russian soldiers walk through streets with barely a single building standing; none is undamaged, the rubble denuding Rubizhne of almost all colors but gray.
Six weeks later, Rubizhne is firmly under Russian control, one of three staging zones for the all-out assault on Severodonetsk. Residents from nearby cities ask themselves — as they have for months now — if it’s time to go.

It may have helped. But it also slowed the exodus of civilians.
For days, crowds fearing Russian artillery sheltered under the ruins of the bridge as snow swirled around them and Ukrainian soldiers helped people — some with children or elderly or disabled citizens on their backs — traverse the icy Irpin River on a series of planks.
Like millions of people across the globe, Roberto Marquez watched television coverage of the ordeal.
“It really touched me,” recalled Marquez, who was in his native Mexico at the time. “I figured this is the place for me to work.“
And so Marquez — an artist who views his work as social advocacy — made his way to Poland and then to Kyiv. Once the Russians retreated from their positions around the city in late March, he set up a makeshift, open-air studio in the shadow of the shattered bridge.
With the blessing of Ukrainian officials, he went to work there on a pair of large canvases.
Outfitted in his 10-gallon leather hat and a bandolier holding his brushes, Marquez painted for more than a month as Ukrainian military foot patrols passed by daily on their rounds.

He created two works — one 6 feet by 14 feet, the other 6 feet by 9 feet — both inspired by Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica.”
They depict a pair of signature early events of the  war in Ukraine: the dramatic river crossing in Irpin and the discovery of what Ukrainian officials are calling mass murder and war crimes in nearby Bucha and other towns that the Russians had occupied.
With the help of Ukrainian friends, Marquez also crafted wooden crosses, which he planted in the ground next to the rubble of the bridge to mark the escape path and honor the war dead. The idea came from the crosses placed by activists along the U.S.-Mexico border to commemorate migrants who died or disappeared there.
“I’m a person of the border,” said Marquez, 60.
He said he was 15 when he crossed the border illegally from Tijuana and went to work as an agricultural hand in California. As one of millions who acquired legal status through the 1986 U.S. amnesty law, he became a U.S. citizen. He later embarked on a lucrative real estate career in Dallas and had four children.
Marquez turned to art as a sideline in the 1990s. Among his first works was a portrait of his mother as a young girl, painted at a time when she was gravely ill with cancer.
“That was like opening the door to another world,” he said.
His creative run turned to activism during the Trump era when caravans of Central American migrants began heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border. In Tijuana, he unveiled a huge variation of the U.S. flag — one that lacked stars and was meant to dramatize the contribution of immigrants.
He called the work “United States of Immigrants.”
He later created on-site artworks at Black Lives Matter rallies and other national protests. “I want to be exactly where the action is,” he said. “That’s where I get my inspiration.”
Once Marquez arrived in Poland in March, he started painting at the Warsaw train station — a key transit point for refugees — and in the town of Medyka, on the border with Ukraine. He stayed in Poland a few weeks, producing Cubist takes on the refugee influx.
He left a handful of completed works behind, and though he is not sure what happened to all of them, he heard that some are now in the possession of Polish museum officials.
In Ukraine, he set up shop next to the destroyed bridge with the support of the mayors of Irpin and neighboring Bucha, two Kyiv suburbs that are struggling to return to normal after the Russian invasion left widespread death and devastation.

Marquez said he chose the Cubist Picasso motif because “Guernica” — which memorializes the Nazi bombing of the Basque town in Spain and is regarded as one of the great antiwar statements of all time — inevitably draws attention. The look is certainly derivative, but never obscure. For Marquez, the message may trump the aesthetic.
“Every time that I do a project, always the first thing that comes to mind is: What do I need to do to connect to people?” he explained. “I can do something in my own style, but sometimes you lose the audience. ... I can paint a ‘Guernica’ with my eyes closed.”

With the Ukrainian flag fluttering overhead, the site has been transformed into a kind of outdoor art installation featuring Marquez’s paintings, the rows of wooden crosses and several handmade signs bearing messages of peace. Also on display is a collection of Russian military gear found abandoned at a nearby town.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced plans for the construction of a national monument at the bridge, commemorating all those who braved the journey.
Marquez said he would be pleased if his paintings were incorporated into the final design. “I hope they leave them there as part of the memorial, but I don’t know exactly,” he said. “Whatever they do is fine by me.”
War is still raging across broad swaths of Ukraine, and many civilians are now fleeing conflict in the east and south. But, for the moment, a sense of calm has returned to the capital and its suburbs.
All that remains of the bridge are two giant concrete blocks with protruding strands of rebar. A temporary span allows traffic to cross. An upturned white minivan still sits at the edge of the river. There are few pedestrians these days."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2022-06-03/ukraine-world-cup-qualifier-moment-of-hope;2022-06-03;World Cup qualifier is 'like a moment of hope' for Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Oleksandr Petrakov showed up at a military enlistment office in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and asked for a weapon.
“I am 64 but I felt it was normal to do this,” Petrakov told a reporter from the Guardian a month later. “I think I could take two or three enemies out.”
The territorial defense force thanked him but declined the offer since Petrakov had no military experience. Besides, as manager of Ukraine’s national soccer team, he was needed elsewhere.
Which brings us to Sunday, when, on a well-manicured patch of grass in Cardiff, Wales, Petrakov can deliver a blow as important to Ukrainian sovereignty as anything he could have accomplished on a battlefield back home.
If Petrakov’s team beats Wales, Ukraine will qualify for its first World Cup in 16 years and just its  second since it became an independent country in 1991. And, while that won’t keep the bombs from falling or stop the battles from raging, it will provide a burst of pride and an invaluable boost in morale for a nation beginning to wilt after more than 100 days of war.

“We are all fighting, each on his own front,” President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. “For our blue and yellow flag, for our coat of arms on our hearts.”
No sport worships national identity like international soccer, whose teams play for their country not their club and wear a flag not a crest over their hearts. It’s why Zinedine Zidane, the child of Algerian immigrants, cried as “La Marseillaise” played following France’s World Cup victory in Paris in 1998. It’s why much of Brazil shuts down whenever la Seleção plays a big game. It’s why the chance to cheer the national team in the 2006 World Cup persuaded the two sides in Ivory Coast’s 3-year-old civil war to put down their weapons and return to the negotiating table.
Soccer
Brenden Aaronson, Tim Weah and Haji Wright scored in the USMNT’s 3-0 win over Morocco in the first of four World Cup warmup matches in June.

It’s also why, for Ukraine, Sunday’s World Cup qualifying match is far more than a game. The army, which had fought the invading Russians to a stalemate for three months, has suffered a series of recent setbacks. Things are particularly dire in the east, where the civilian death toll is mounting as the Russians consolidate their gains.
Beating Wales won’t change that, but it will be welcome good news amid the bad.
“Everyone knows the situation back in Ukraine,” midfielder Oleksandr Zinchenko told ESPN. “We need to show the best performance of our lives.”
As midfielder Taras Stepanenko told reporters last month: “Every day, we receive messages from our soldiers. A lot of soldiers, a lot of people in Ukraine love football, and they [have] only one demand: ‘Please do everything you can to go to the World Cup.’
“For them, it’s like a moment of hope. That’s why we have to play … with our soul, with our heart. This is very, very important. It will be very emotional for my country, for our players and for all Ukraine.”
Ukraine is unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, but because six of its eight games in group play ended in a draw, it finished second to reigning world champion France and did not earn an automatic berth in this fall’s tournament in Qatar. Instead it was put in a 12-team playoff, where three additional World Cup berths were at stake.

In one playoff group, Poland was scheduled to play Russia but, in solidarity with Ukraine, it refused. Sweden and the Czech Republic, the other teams in the group, also refused, choosing to forfeit their chances at a World Cup berth rather than share a field with the Russians.

Four days later FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, suspended Russia and Poland went on to qualify.
For Ukraine, the war postponed its first playoff game 10 weeks to June 1. It then played an inspired 90 minutes to beat Scotland 3-1. However, that will mean nothing if it doesn’t beat Wales on Sunday.
“A lot of soldiers, a lot of people in Ukraine love football, and they [have] only one demand: ‘Please do everything you can to go to the World Cup.’ For them, it’s like a moment of hope.”
— Ukraine midfielder Taras Stepanenko
The odds are long. The game with Scotland was the first competitive match for Ukraine in 6½ months, and now it must come back, four days later, on tired legs against the 18th-ranked team in the world, one which will be well-rested.

Soccer is not a national obsession in Ukraine the way it is in Argentina and Brazil, but then Argentina and Brazil aren’t at war. That reality has changed the way the team is viewed in Ukraine.
Because of the fighting, large gatherings are banned in much of the country, especially at night, so people were forced to watch the Scotland game alone or in small groups. They will do the same Sunday for the Wales match.
“Of course we are all proud of the team,” said Oleg Prystavsky, 21, a fan in the western city of Lviv. “And we will be watching.”

Yet if Ukraine is taking inspiration from its soccer team, the players are taking their strength from the people fighting back home.
“There are times when you don’t need a lot of words,” Zelensky wrote. “Just pride.”
The team is getting that from Petrakov, who, like Zelensky, has risen to a challenge many thought would overwhelm him.
Petrakov grew up playing in the Soviet soccer system and had a long if undistinguished playing career that included a short stint with an army team before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. As a coach, he cycled through a number of amateur and lower-division pro teams before joining the Ukrainian national team program on the age-group level 11 years ago.
His greatest success came in the 2019 U-20 World Cup, when Ukraine beat South Korea in the final. It was the country’s first international trophy at any level, so when Andriy Shevchenko stepped down as the senior national team coach last August, a month after getting routed by England in the European Championship, Petrakov was chosen to replace him.
Ukraine hasn’t lost since.
When the war started, Petrakov showed leadership of another kind. With the Russians approaching the capital, Petrakov’s family urged him to leave Kyiv, but he refused. The Germans had occupied his mother’s house in World War II, he said, so he would stay and fight if that’s what it took.
A Russian speaker from childhood, he now uses only Ukrainian in public. As for his feelings about the Moscow government that once employed him, he is uncommonly succinct.
“It’s just hate,” he told reporters.

Galaxy star Javier “Chicharito” Hernández says he recently talked to Mexico manager Tata Martino. Could a return to the national team be coming?

“For me, there is no longer a country called Russia,” he added. “I no longer have any friends there.”
Although Sunday’s game will be played in a sold-out Cardiff City Stadium, the Ukrainians won’t be lacking for support. The Football Assn. of Wales and the Welsh government have given free tickets to Ukrainian refugees and invited the Ukrainian ambassador to attend the game. Even Welsh fans, who haven’t seen their team play in a World Cup since 1958, admit they’re torn.
“You’ve obviously got mixed emotions, because it’s the compassion you feel for Ukraine,” former Welsh national team striker Rob Earnshaw told the BBC. “It is very tough when you’re faced with something like this because it’s about humanity in this moment and I think everyone has felt so much for Ukraine. They feel the pain, they feel the pain of a country at war.”
There’s no such dilemma outside of Wales.
“I think we’re all pulling for Ukraine,” said U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter, whose team will play Sunday’s winner in its World Cup opener in November. “We’re all behind them, all supporting them.”

In other words, would Zelensky lead a historic resistance or flee while his government collapsed?
World & Nation
It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.

Ultimately, U.S. intelligence agencies underestimated Zelensky and Ukraine while overestimating Russia and its president, even as they accurately predicted Vladimir Putin would order an invasion.
But Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, did not fall in a few days, as the United States had expected. And while American spy agencies have been credited with supporting Ukraine’s resistance, they now face bipartisan pressure to review what they got wrong beforehand — especially after their mistakes in judging Afghanistan last year.
Intelligence officials have begun a review of how their agencies judge the will and ability of foreign governments to fight. The review is taking place while U.S. intelligence continues to have a critical role in Ukraine and as the White House ramps up weapons deliveries and support to Ukraine, trying to predict what Putin might see as escalatory and seeking to avoid a direct war with Russia.
World & Nation
Russia once sought to topple Ukraine’s government. Ukraine fought off the assault on Kyiv, but Russian forces are having more success since shifting their offensive to the east.

President Biden’s administration announced it would give Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a weapon that Ukraine has long wanted. Since the war began on Feb. 24, the White House has approved shipping drone aircraft, anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and millions of rounds of ammunition. The U.S. has lifted early restrictions on intelligence sharing to provide information that Ukraine has used to strike critical targets, including the flagship vessel of the Russian navy.

Lawmakers from both parties question whether the U.S. could have done more before Putin invaded and whether the White House held back some support due to pessimistic assessments of Ukraine‘s ability to resist. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last month that “had we had a better handle on the prediction, we could have done more to assist the Ukrainians earlier.”
Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that he thought the White House and top administration officials had projected “their own bias on the situation in a way that lends itself to inaction.”
The Senate Intelligence Committee sent a classified letter last month to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence asking about how intelligence agencies assessed both Ukraine and Afghanistan. CNN first reported the letter.
The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told lawmakers in May that the National Intelligence Council would review how the agencies assess both “will to fight” and “capacity to fight.” Both issues are “quite challenging to provide effective analysis on and we’re looking at different methodologies for doing so,” Haines said.
While there is no announced timetable for the review, which began before the committee’s letter, officials have identified some errors. Several people familiar with prewar assessments spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
World & Nation
The stepped-up attacks come as Russian President Vladimir Putin orders new initiatives to try to solidify Moscow’s gains and secure new ones.


Despite its vast advantages, Russia failed to establish air superiority over Ukraine and failed at basic tasks such as securing its battlefield communications. It has lost thousands of soldiers and at least eight to 10 generals, according to U.S. estimates. Russian and Ukrainian forces are now fighting in fierce, close-quarters combat in eastern Ukraine, far from the swift Russian victory forecast by the U.S. and the West.
While Russia has entered recent proxy wars, it had not directly fought a major land war since the 1980s. That meant many of Russia’s projected and claimed capabilities had not been put to the test, posing a challenge for analysts to assess how Russia  would perform in a major invasion, some of the people said. Russia’s active weapons export industry led some people to believe Moscow would have many more missile systems and planes ready to deploy.
Russia has so far not used chemical or biological weapons, as the U.S. publicly warned it might. One official noted that the U.S. had “very strong concerns” about a chemical attack, but that Russia may have decided that would raise too much global opposition. Fears that Russia would use a wave of cyberattacks against Ukraine and allies have not been realized to this point.
Other Russian problems were well known, including low troop morale, a prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse among troops and the lack of a noncommissioned officer corps to oversee forces and deliver instructions from commanders.
“We knew all of those things existed,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. “But it just became a cascading effect of how overwhelming all of that became when they tried to do even the most simple of operations.”
Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy director of national intelligence, said U.S. analysts may have relied too much on counting Russia’s inventory of military and cyber tools.
“We’re going to learn a little bit about how we think about capability and use as not one and the same when you assess outcome,” she said at a recent event sponsored by Cipher Brief, an intelligence publication.
Zelensky has received worldwide acclaim for refusing to flee as Russia sent teams to try to capture or kill him. But before the war, there were tensions between Washington and Kyiv about the likelihood of an invasion and whether Ukraine was prepared. One flashpoint, according to people familiar with the dispute, was that the U.S. wanted Ukraine to move forces from its west to bolster defenses around Kyiv.
Until shortly before the war, Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials publicly discounted warnings of an invasion, in part to tamp down panic and protect the economy. One U.S. official said there were doubts that the inexperienced Zelensky could cope with a crisis of the level his country was facing.
Army Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the current director of the DIA, testified in March that “my view was that, based on a variety of factors, that the Ukrainians were not as ready as I thought they should be. Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing.”
In May, Berrier distanced his own view from that of the entire intelligence community, which he said never had an assessment “that said the Ukrainians lacked the will to fight.”
There was ample evidence of Ukraine’s determination before the war. Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the eight-year conflict in the eastern Donbas region had hardened public attitudes against Moscow. Ukrainian forces had received years of training and weapons shipments from the U.S. across several administrations along with help bolstering its cyber defenses.

Russian and Ukrainian troops engaged in close-quarter combat as Moscow’s soldiers attempted to gain strategic footholds in eastern Ukraine.


U.S. intelligence had reviewed private polling that suggested strong support in Ukraine for any resistance. In Kharkiv, a mostly Russian-speaking city near the border, citizens were learning to fire guns and training for guerrilla warfare.
Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, saw that determination firsthand during a December trip. Wenstrup witnessed a military ceremony where participants would read the names of every Ukrainian soldier who had died the previous day on the front lines in the Donbas,  where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014.
“It showed to me that they had a will to fight,” he said. “This has been brewing for a long time.”"

World leaders advised him to flee.
“But they didn’t know us,” he said in a late-night video address in April when the war hit its 50th day. “And they didn’t know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom.”
He could have been speaking about himself. No one knew how a 44-year-old man who had catapulted himself from the world of entertainment into the presidency would respond to an invasion by Russia’s giant army.
His response has been forceful — and compellingly public. Zelensky has led his country in mounting an unexpectedly fierce resistance. Every night, he rallies Ukrainians to the fight with a video address on social media. There have been 100 so far — one for each day of the war — in nightly reminders that he has not fled, that Ukraine has indeed survived.
His actor-trained voice can be soothing, a deep, confidential almost-whisper as he looks directly into the camera. Or forceful, rising in moral outrage as he condemns the most recent Russian atrocities and insists that those responsible will be punished.
As the days and weeks have ticked by, his unshaven face has grown a dark beard. He has lost his boyish looks. The puffiness from sleepless nights as Russian troops marched on the capital was replaced by new resolve when the invasion stalled.

From the start of the war he has dressed in various shades of army green, appearing most often in a simple T-shirt. The impression he leaves is clear: He’s fresh from the fight and about to get back to it.

A tireless and skilled communicator, Zelensky has spoken by video link to the United Nations, British Parliament, U.S. Congress and about two dozen other parliaments around the world, as well as to the Cannes Film Festival and the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas. Rarely if ever has a man without a tie addressed so many VIPs. He also has given interviews to journalists. He held a news conference in the safety of the Kyiv subway.
But his nightly video address has been his favored channel for informing and inspiring his fellow citizens.
He often begins with an exuberant greeting to Ukrainians as “the free people of a brave country” or “the invincible people of our great country.” He invariably ends with a defiant “Slava Ukraini” — Glory to Ukraine.
He tells them of the world leaders he has spoken with during the day and his efforts to get those leaders to send more and better weapons, to inflict ever more punishing sanctions on Russia.

He speaks to his fellow Ukrainians’ anger and pain from the devastation of the country, the untold deaths. “My heart breaks from what Russia is doing to our people,” he said on March 16 after Russian bombs killed hundreds sheltering in a theater in Mariupol.
He salutes their courage and says he never gets tired of thanking all those fighting to determine the future of Ukraine. That the country did not fall within days as Russia expected, he said on April 14, was because millions of Ukrainians “made the most important decision of their life — to fight.”
He also has tried to reach a Russian audience, as on April 1 when he switched from Ukrainian into Russian to urge Russians to keep their sons away from the war.
“We do not need new dead people here,” he said. “Take care of your children so they do not become villains, do not send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home.”
In his video address Friday on the war’s 100th day, Zelensky said many words and numbers are now associated with the war, but “there are three words for which we have been fighting for 100 days after eight years: ‘peace,’ ‘victory,’ ‘Ukraine.’ Glory to Ukraine!”

In justifying the Feb. 24 invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was saving Ukraine from the “drug addicts and neo-Nazis” of Zelensky’s government. He has since ignored Zelensky’s calls for a meeting.
Back in June 2019, shortly after Zelensky was elected president, Putin was asked why he hadn’t congratulated the new Ukrainian leader. In a condescending response, Putin seemed to write off the actor-turned-president.
“Well, it’s one thing to play someone and another to be someone,” Putin said. “The important thing is to have the courage and the character to take responsibility. He hasn’t shown his character yet.”
For 100 nights, that character has been shown to Ukrainians and the world. And to Putin."

But as the invasion reached its 100th day on Friday, Russia seems increasingly unlikely to relinquish the territory it has taken in the war.
The ruble is now an official currency in the southern Kherson region, alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia. Residents there and in Russian-controlled parts of the Zaporizhzhia region are being offered Russian passports. The Kremlin-installed administrations in both regions have discussed plans to become part of Russia.
The Moscow-backed leaders of separatist areas in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which is mostly Russian-speaking, have shared similar intentions. Putin recognized the separatists’ self-proclaimed republics as independent states two days before launching the invasion. Fighting has intensified in Ukraine’s east as Russia seeks to “liberate” all of the Donbas.
The Kremlin has largely kept mum about its plans for the cities, towns and villages it has bombarded with missiles, encircled and finally captured.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian troops have succeeded in their main stated task of protecting civilians in the separatist-controlled areas. He added that Russian forces had “liberated” parts of Ukraine and that “this work will continue until all the goals of the special military operation are achieved.”
In a video message marking the war’s first 100 days, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky indicated that his country would not submit easily to Russian aggression after showing it could withstand months of attacks from a larger adversary.

“We have defended Ukraine for 100 days already. Victory will be ours,” he said.

Annexing more land from Ukraine was never the main goal of the invasion, but Russia is unlikely to let go of its military gains, according to political analysts.
“Of course [Russia] intends to stay,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From Russia’s perspective, he added, “it’s a pity to give away what has been occupied, even if it was not part of the original plan.”
Putin has described the goals of the invasion somewhat vaguely, saying it was aimed at the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine. It was widely believed that the Kremlin intended initially to install a pro-Moscow government in the capital, Kyiv, and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO or taking other steps away from Russia’s sphere of influence.

A Ukrainian couple have turned their farm into a sanctuary for all sorts of animals left behind during the war — and for some of their owners as well.

Russia captured much of Kherson and neighboring Zaporizhzhia early in the war, gaining control over most of Ukraine’s Sea of Azov coast and securing a partial land corridor to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
There was hardly a warm welcome from the locals. Residents of the cities of Kherson and Melitopol took to the streets to protest the occupation, facing off with Russian soldiers in plazas. Ukrainian officials warned that Russia might stage a referendum in Kherson to declare the region an independent state.
Moscow installed people with pro-Kremlin views to replace mayors and other local leaders who had disappeared in what Ukrainian officials and media said were kidnappings. Russian flags were raised. Russian state broadcasts that promoted the Kremlin’s version of the invasion supplanted Ukrainian TV channels.

The Russian ruble this month was introduced as the second official currency in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions — at least in parts under Russian control — and pro-Russian administrations started offering a “one-time social payment” of 10,000 rubles (roughly $158) to local residents.
Top Russian officials started touring the regions, touting the territories’ prospects for being integrated into Russia. Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin visited Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in mid-May and indicated that they could become part of “our Russian family.”
A senior official in the Kremlin’s ruling United Russia party, Andrei Turchak, put it even more bluntly in a meeting with residents of Kherson: “Russia is here forever.”

Members of the pro-Kremlin administrations in both regions soon announced that the areas would seek to be incorporated into Russia. While it remains unclear when or if it will happen, Russia is laying the groundwork.
An office of Russia’s migration services opened in Melitopol, taking applications for Russian citizenship in a fast-track procedure that Putin expanded to residents of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The rapid procedure was first implemented in 2019 in the rebel-controlled areas of the Donbas, where more than 700,000 people have received Russian passports.
Oleg Kryuchkov, an official in Russia-annexed Crimea, said this week that the two southern regions had switched to Russian internet providers; state media posted video of people lining up to get Russian SIM cards for their cellphones. Kryuchkov also said that both regions were switching to the Russian country code, +7, from the Ukrainian +380.
Senior Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, a member of the Russian delegation in stalled peace talks with Ukraine, said that referendums on joining Russia could take place in the Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as early as July.

Kremlin spokesman Peskov was evasive when asked Friday whether Russian authorities planned to hold votes in those areas, saying that it would depend on the course of Russia’s offensive. He and other Russian officials have said repeatedly that it would be up to local residents to determine their future status.
Tatiana Stanovaya, founder and chief executive of R.Politik, an independent think tank on Russian politics based in Moscow, thinks Putin doesn’t want to rush the referendums and risk them being denounced as shams.“He wants the referendum to be real, so that the West can see that, indeed, Russia was right, the people want to live with Russia,” Stanovaya said.
Ukrainian experts say it is not going to be easy for the Kremlin to rally genuine support in Ukraine’s south.

Ukraine is one of the world’s largest exporters of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, but the war has prevented most of those products from getting out.


Volodymyr Fesenko, of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank, said residents of the southern regions identify as Ukrainians much more strongly than the people who live in areas closer to Russia or who have been led by the Moscow-backed separatists for eight years.
“We already see that the occupying Russian administration is forced to tighten the screws and intensify repressions in the southern regions, since it cannot effectively control the protest sentiment,” Fesenko said. “And this causes a new wave of discontent among the population, which received nothing but Russian SIM cards and high Russian prices.”
Local residents echoed Fesenko’s sentiment.
Petro Kobernyk, 31, an activist with a nongovernmental organization who fled Kherson with his wife, said Russian repression began in the first days of the occupation.

In a tranquil Ukrainian monastery, dozens driven from homes by war find refuge. The nuns say they will offer shelter as long as it’s needed.

“Hundreds of pro-Ukrainian activists, including my friends, are being held in the basements of security services,” Kobernyk said by phone. “Those who actively express their position are kidnapped and tortured, threatened and forced out of the region.”
His claims could not be independently verified. Russian forces keep people in an “an information vacuum,” with Ukrainian websites no longer available, Kobernyk said.
He described a bleak life in Kherson. With many stores shut down, the city “has turned into an endless market where people exchange goods for medicines and food.”
But some in Ukraine welcome Russia’s actions.
Vadim Romanova, a 17-year-old from the devastated port city of Mariupol, said one of his dreams has come true.

But this winter, after Russia invaded Ukraine, initiating a war that has killed thousands of people  and created more than 6 million refugees, mention of “Russia” and “festival” in the same breath  turned taboo.
City officials instead recast this year’s event as a fundraiser for Ukrainian refugees, pairing free activities for children (face painting, magicians, carnival games) with a silent auction and exhibit booths for humanitarian aid groups to collect donations.
“The point of all of this is for us to help those who are in need right now,” said Eugene Maysky, who came to Southern California from St. Petersburg seven years ago and now chairs West Hollywood’s Russian Advisory Board.
West Hollywood has long laid claim to having the largest concentration of Russian-speaking residents  outside of New York, with the city’s east end a hub of emigres from the former Soviet Union, including Latvia, Georgia, Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine.
“There’s no rhyme or reason or any point to do this, because we all have relatives in both countries,” Maysky said of the ongoing war. “For us, it’s like one hand trying to kill another hand.”
Under the sun at Plummer Park, guests munched on pelmeni dumplings and Lithuanian ice cream at tables adorned in blue and yellow, in homage to Ukraine’s flag. Images of blooming sunflowers — Ukraine’s national flower — decorated the stage. Some attendees wore sunflower crowns, draped Ukrainian flags over their shoulders and struck notes of pain, solidarity, defiance and a touch of humor with their T-shirts. One read: “My wife is Ukrainian. Nothing scares me.”
Working among the booths lining the park was Julia Stadnik, a vice president at the shipping company Meest, the Ukrainian word for bridge. Since the war broke out, Stadnik said she and her family, who run a Glendale outpost of Meest, leveraged their decades of logistics experience and networks in Poland and Germany to help ship more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid — clothes, food and “anything for the army.”

“It’s stressful,” said Stadnik, who was born in L.A. but whose parents hail from Lviv in western Ukraine. Many relatives are still in Ukraine, albeit on the relatively calmer west side. “But a cousin is getting trained for the army and prepared,” Stadnik said. “They are all worried.”
On Sunday, Stadnik was letting passersby know they could purchase care packages of food, even flowers, to deliver to loved ones in Ukraine, and that the public could give money directly to the company to fund ongoing aid shipments.
“Humanitarian aid is still getting brought,” she explained, referring to donations of clothing and other goods. “But the funding to get it overseas is the difficult part.”
At another booth, volunteers were selling dozens of vyshyvanka, a traditional embroidered shirt. A Reseda physician, Dr. Alex Fridman, had purchased the shirts directly from Ukraine, and all the proceeds from Sunday’s sales were paying for refugee children to attend Camp Gesher, a Jewish summer camp in Malibu. The silent auction’s proceeds were also supporting attendance at the camp, said Dina Gontar, the longtime event producer.
The festival was a “huge” change in tenor from past years, Gontar acknowledged, and she was uncertain about what next year would bring: “Hopefully the war will be over, and we’ll live in a peaceful time.”
For Victoria Pindrik, the fundraiser offered a chance to remind the community about the need for help. Pindrik founded the nonprofit Save Ukraine Relief Fund on the second day of the war, and the group has since completed  1,000-plus emergency evacuations while also assisting refugees at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Known as SURF — an homage to  its base in California — the organization has become a hub for refugees in need of food, aid, jobs and help with paperwork. Though Pindrik observed a surge of support in the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, as time passes she sees diminished interest.
“It’s become a part of daily life — ‘Oh, another rocket,’ ” she said. “But for those with friends and family on the front lines, they don’t know if they’ll hear their voice tomorrow.”
Sunday’s festival and fundraiser, she said, was to remind people, “We are here and available.”
Maysky, of the Russian Advisory Board, took the metaphor of family further, hoping  that in the face of an “absurd” war, the fundraiser could foster more  unity among Russian-speaking people.
“We’ve always been siblings — brothers and sisters,” he said. “It’s not like everything’s always perfect, but like siblings, in the end, we stand up for each other because we love each other.”"

Moscow’s forces have taken control of “most” of Severodonetsk, Britain’s Defense Ministry said in a briefing Thursday. Their gains follow street battles and heavy artillery bombardment that has leveled swaths of the city near the banks of the strategic Seversky Donets River.


Capture of Severodonetsk could precipitate the fall of Luhansk, one of two eastern provinces bordering Russia that form the Donbas region, where the Kremlin has concentrated its military might after its failure to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.
Serhiy Haidai, Luhansk’s regional governor, said via the messaging app Telegram on Thursday that Severodonetsk had yet to fall and that Ukrainian soldiers had dislodged Russian troops from some streets. He said Ukrainian forces were in touch with some residents hiding in bomb shelters. Up to 12,000 civilians are believed to remain in the city.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to lawmakers in Luxembourg that Russian forces now control almost 20% of Ukrainian territory and that “tens of thousands” of people have died in the first 99 days of the war.
Seeking to turn up the economic and political heat on Russia, the White House announced yet another round of sanctions Thursday targeting prominent Russian officials, oligarchs and business elites. The Department of Commerce also plans to expand its export controls on groups in Russia and Belarus in order to block access to advanced technologies needed to the sustain the war effort.
Meanwhile, the United States and its allies voiced support Thursday for prosecution of Russian war crimes by the International Criminal Court, which has deployed dozens of investigators, forensic experts and support staff to Ukraine.


“We’ve received reports of women and girls being raped, some publicly, and children taken away into Russia and put up for adoption,” U.S. Undersecretary of State Uzra Zeya said at a United Nations Security Council meeting. “Russian forces continue to deny safe passage to civilians fleeing violence, and to humanitarian organizations trying to reach those in need.”
U.S. officials say that the war of attrition could drag on for months and that the West has little choice but to ship increasingly sophisticated military equipment to bolster Ukraine’s defense.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denounced the aid and its providers, saying Thursday that it would “bring more suffering to Ukraine, which is merely a tool in the hands of those countries that supply it with weapons.”
British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Thursday that Britain would send an unspecified number of rocket launchers able to hit targets with precision up to 50 miles away. The announcement came a day after the U.S. promised to dispatch a similar rocket system, as well as helicopters and Javelin antitank weapons. The systems are superior to what Ukraine — whose troops will be trained in their use — currently owns.
In addition, Germany has newly pledged to provide antiaircraft missiles, and Slovakia said that it would send eight howitzers, though in a commercial deal rather than as military aid. Sweden also indicated its intention to donate anti-ship missiles, antitank weapons, semiautomatic rifles and munitions.

Russia has tried to thwart deliveries of Western arms, most recently Wednesday night when four cruise missiles fired from ships in the Black Sea struck railway infrastructure outside the western city of Lviv, causing significant damage, said Maksym Kozytsky, head of the Lviv region.
He said that five people were wounded and that four of them were hospitalized and in moderate condition. It was the latest example of Russia targeting Ukraine’s extensive rail network, which is a source of considerable pride among Ukrainians.
The strikes have wrought extensive damage and delays on a rail system that has helped transport hundreds of thousands of displaced people to safety since the war began.

A school in Kharkiv’s Kievsky district was hit by Russian shells Wednesday night, Ukrainian emergency officials said, killing one woman and injuring a man.
Sustained, indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets have taken a massive toll on Ukraine’s children, Zelensky said in a video address Wednesday.
He said at least 243 children have died, 139 are missing and 446 have been injured since Russia invaded Feb. 24.
“These are only those we know about,” said Zelensky, who was marking International Children’s Day. “We do not yet have all the information from the territory that is currently occupied.”
In addition to the casualties, Zelensky said an estimated 200,000 children are among the many Ukrainians who have been relocated to Russia against their will. The youngsters include those from orphanages and children separated from their parents and families.
“This is one of Russia’s most heinous war crimes,” he said. “The Russian state disperses these people on its territory, settles our citizens, in particular, in remote regions. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people, but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return.”


In a rare bright spot for the embattled country, Ukraine defeated Scotland, 3-1, in an emotionally charged World Cup qualifying match Wednesday. The game in Glasgow was the first time the Ukrainian national men’s soccer team has appeared since the war began.

Western arms have been crucial to Ukraine’s success in stymieing Russia’s much larger and better-equipped military, thwarting its effort to storm the capital and forcing Moscow to shift its focus to the industrial Donbas region in the east.
But as Russia bombards towns in its inching advance in the east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for more and better weapons and accused the West of moving too slowly.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, hailed the new Western weapons.
“I’m sure that if we receive all the necessary weapons and strengthen the efficient sanctions regime, we will win,” he said.
The new arms could help Ukraine set up and hold new lines of defense in the east by hitting back at Russian artillery pieces that have been battering towns and cities and by limiting Russian airstrikes, said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France’s military mission at the United Nations.

“The NATO countries — the European nations and the Americans — have progressively escalated the means that they are putting at Ukraine’s disposal, and this escalation, in my opinion, has had the aim of testing Russian limits,” he said. “Each time, they measure the Russian reaction, and since there is no reaction, they keep supplying increasingly effective and sophisticated weaponry.”

Civilians who managed to flee eastern Ukraine say intensified shelling over the past week left them unable to even venture out from bomb shelters.

Military analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight.
The rocket systems are part of a new $700-million package of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that also includes helicopters, Javelin antitank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.
The rockets have a range of about 50 miles  and are highly mobile. Ukraine had pushed unsuccessfully for rockets with a range of up to 186 miles.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not trust assurances that Ukraine will not fire on Russian territory. “We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,” he said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine’s push for more weapons is a “direct provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting.” He warned that the multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict.
“Sane Western politicians understand those risks well,” he said.
Germany’s promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war. Earlier deliveries of portable, shoulder-fired air defense missiles have bolstered the Ukrainian military’s ability to take down helicopters and other low-flying aircraft but didn’t give it enough range to challenge Russia’s air superiority.
Germany has come under particular criticism, both at home and from allies abroad, that it isn’t doing enough. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T’s surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has.
“With this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,” he said. The radar systems will also help Ukraine locate enemy artillery.
The weapons announcements came as a regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of  Severodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow’s efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have fought for years and where the separatists held swaths of territory even before the invasion.
Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian troops were advancing in the city amid fierce street battles with Ukrainian forces, though he noted that in some districts the Ukrainian troops managed to push the Russians back.
The only other city in Luhansk that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, he said, but is likely to be next.
“If the Russians manage to take full control over Severodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,” Haidai said.
Zelensky, meanwhile. said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting.
In southern Ukraine, a regional governor sounded a more positive note, saying Russian troops are retreating and blowing up bridges behind them.
“They are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,” Vitaliy Kim, governor of the  Mykolaiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

Germany said Wednesday that it would supply Ukraine with modern antiaircraft missiles and radar systems, and the U.S. is to unveil a new weapons package for Kyiv later in the day that is expected to include high-tech, medium-range rocket systems.
The U.S. is trying to strike a balance by helping Ukraine battle ferocious Russian artillery barrages while not providing weapons that could allow Ukrainian forces to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war.

Families across Africa are paying about 45% more for wheat flour as Russia’s war in Ukraine blocks exports from the Black Sea.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T SLM missiles that it will send are the most modern air-defense system that Germany has. They can operate at longer ranges than the Cold War-era antiaircraft vehicles it has previously provided.
“With this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,” he said. He said Germany would also supply Ukraine with radar systems to help locate enemy artillery.

In addition to the rocket systems it had promised, the U.S. package will include helicopters, Javelin antitank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, two senior administration officials said Tuesday. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the package before it is formally unveiled.
One official noted that the advanced rocket systems would give Ukrainian forces greater precision in targeting Russian assets inside Ukraine. The rockets, which have a range of about 50 miles and are highly mobile, will allow Ukrainian troops to disrupt Russian supply lines, said another Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. has received assurances that Ukraine will not fire rockets into Russian territory, according to the senior administration officials.
Russia views “negatively” the U.S. plans to supply more weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday, saying that Moscow did not trust Kyiv’s assurances that the rocket systems would not be used to attack Russia.
“We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,” Peskov said.

Gov. Serhiy Haidai of the Luhansk region said street fighting was ongoing in the city, where about 13,000 people remain even though 90% of residential buildings have been damaged. Tens of thousands have fled the city, once home to about 100,000 people.
He noted that the only other city in the Luhansk region that Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still “fully” under Ukrainian control.
“If the Russians manage to take full control over Severodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,” Haidai said.

Separately, in a Telegram post Wednesday, Haidai noted that some Ukrainian troops had pulled back from Severodonetsk.

Zelensky said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting and that another 500 are wounded.
He told the U.S. TV channel Newsmax on Tuesday night that “the most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk” — the two provinces that make up the Donbas region.

In southern Ukraine, a regional governor said Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges to obstruct a possible Ukrainian advance. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, said in messages on Telegram on Wednesday that Russia was on the defensive.
“They are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,” Kim wrote. He didn’t specify where the retreat was happening. The parts of the Mykolaiv region which have been held by Russian forces in recent days are close to the large Russia-held city of Kherson.
Zelensky said in his nightly address there had been “some success in the Kherson direction” for Ukraine."

But if the future looks bleak, perhaps that’s because we focus on the conflicts that happen and overlook the gravitational pull of peace.
An example came on March 9, two weeks into the Russian invasion. Shortly after sundown, India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan. Predictably, calm ensued. Both sides strove to avoid escalation — as they have for decades.
Focusing on the times peace fails is a kind of selection bias, one that makes us think that war is more common than it really is. The India incident is a good reminder of a simple fact: War is so ruinous that enemies prefer to loathe each other in peace.
Even Vladimir Putin, author of the world-changing conflict in Ukraine, tried to avoid war in his own insidious way. For two decades, he employed every underhanded means possible to co-opt Ukraine: dark money, propaganda, political stooges, poisonings and separatist support. He did all of that because, as vicious and costly as these things were, not one was as reckless as war.
World & Nation
As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, Russian forces appear to be on the cusp of a breakthrough in the contested Donbas region.

I’m not pointing all this out to downplay the horror of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin’s brutal war deserves our utmost attention. But it would be misleading, not to mention demoralizing, if we did not also consider the pull of peace. More important, the two together will give us insights into when and how the current conflagration might end.
First, why did Russia invade? Every answer to “why we fight”’ is an example of a society or its leaders ignoring the terrible price that will be paid. Putin, isolated and insulated, apparently underestimated the uncertain costs of invading Ukraine. Also, as a dictator, he knew he wouldn’t have to pay most of them (his people would). And he appears willing to endure whatever costs he will bear to achieve his particular ends: personal and national glory, plus self- and power preservation — eliminating a democracy on his front doorstep.
In the end, however, the expense of this war will be a powerful incentive to limit the fighting. The most visible costs are the tens of thousands killed, and the cities turned to rubble. Less obvious, but crucial, are the treasuries being drained on both sides.

Berkeley economist Yuriy Gorodnichenko estimates that Ukraine requires half of its pre-war monthly national income to continue the conventional war it has been fighting. Of course, Ukraine is earning nowhere near this amount. And even if its factories and fields were producing at full tilt, the country cannot bring those goods to market — the Russian occupation of Mariupol and its blockade of other Ukrainian ports means few goods get out.
Russia has the deeper pockets, but its price of fighting is still exorbitant. One Russian central banker believes the consequent recession in his country will be as deep as its post-Cold War economic collapse — only worse, because the recovery will be slower. Should the fighting persist, he predicts “reverse industrialization.” That is bad news for a president who built his popularity on delivering prosperity. It may be why Putin did not use his May 9 Victory Day speech to escalate the conflict.
Opinion
A historic $40 billion package marks a rare bipartisan moment in Washington.

The costs on both sides could mean the Ukraine war will be counted in months not years. Even so, bargaining power in the months ahead will lie with the side most willing and able to pay war’s monstrous price. This means Ukraine’s allies, chief among them the United States, will be facing fraught decisions as the fighting goes on, with complicated strategic dynamics — few of which are being publicly discussed.
Looking forward, Ukraine’s economy cannot support an indefinite conventional war on its own. Insurgency is an option, but sustained regular warfare probably hinges on the West’s willingness to help cover the bill. If so, NATO’s resolve (and money) will help shape the length and brutality of this war.
As long as Putin believes Russia’s military and treasury can outlast Ukraine’s, he has an incentive to wage a war of attrition. NATO could counter this incentive. A firm commitment now to pay and keep paying for the war could undermine Russia’s plan to wear down Ukraine, hastening the end of fighting.
The flip side, however, is that Western hesitancy or ambiguity about its support could coax Russia back toward that war of attrition. The U.S. just committed $40 billion to Ukraine. Britain  added a further £1.3 billion ($1.6 billion). By Gorodnichenko’s numbers, that’s equal to about six or seven months of Ukraine’s war bill. Will that ratchet up the costs enough on Putin? Or will the West need to go further?
If only “back Ukraine at all costs” were a simple and safe choice. Peace may exert a gravitational pull, but that does not mean nothing escapes its orbit. If Russia mistrusts Western resolve, misperceives the threat or is ideologically intent on takeover anyway, the fighting could be long and intense. NATO could find itself supporting another forever war, one with a small but scary risk of escalation between NATO and Russia.
We must support weapons, financial aid and debt forgiveness for Ukraine in this time of need, but let’s be clear-eyed about what it means to send a firm and committed signal. It means that six or seven months from now, if Putin hasn’t backed down, the West’s unity and passion cannot wane. Should we waffle or equivocate, the highest cost of ongoing war will be borne by Ukrainians.

Nearly all the wheat sold in Somalia comes from Ukraine and Russia, which have halted exports through the Black Sea since Moscow waged war on its neighbor on Feb. 24. The timing could not be worse: The United Nations has warned that an estimated 13 million people are facing severe hunger in the Horn of Africa region as a result of a persistent drought.
Abdirahman has been trying to make do by substituting sorghum, another more readily available grain, in her flatbread. Inflation, though, means the price of the cooking oil she still needs to prepare it has skyrocketed, too — a jar that once cost $16 is now selling for $45 in the markets of Mogadishu.
“The cost of living is high nowadays, making it difficult for families even to afford flour and oil,” she says.
Haji Abdi Dhiblawe, a businessman who imports wheat flour into Somalia, fears the situation will only worsen: There is also a looming shortage of shipping containers to bring food supplies in from elsewhere at the moment.
“Somalis have no place to grow wheat, and we are not even familiar with how to grow it,” he says. “Our main concern now is what will the future hold for us when we currently run out of supplies.”

A coalition of Russian troops, Chechen fighters and pro-Moscow separatists is close to overrunning all of Luhansk province in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Another 18 million people are facing severe hunger in the Sahel, the part of Africa just below the Sahara Desert, where farmers are enduring their worst agricultural production in more than a decade. The U.N. World Food Program says food shortages could worsen when the lean season arrives in late summer.

“Acute hunger is soaring to unprecedented levels, and the global situation just keeps on getting worse. Conflict, the climate crisis, COVID-19 and surging food and fuel costs have created a perfect storm — and now we’ve got the war in Ukraine piling catastrophe on top of catastrophe,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley warned earlier this month.
Even the cost of therapeutic food for malnourished children could rise 16% over the next six months because of the war in Ukraine and disruptions related to the pandemic, UNICEF says.
African countries imported 44% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine between 2018 and 2020, according to U.N. figures. The African Development Bank is already reporting a 45% increase in wheat prices on the continent, making everything from couscous in Mauritania to the fried doughnuts sold in Congo more expensive for customers.

The watered-down embargo covers only Russian oil brought in by sea, allowing a temporary exemption for imports delivered by pipeline.

“Africa has no control over production or logistics chains and is totally at the mercy of the situation,” said Senegalese President Macky Sall, the African Union chairman, who has said he will travel to Russia and Ukraine to discuss the price woes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin pressed the West last week to lift sanctions against Moscow over the war in Ukraine, seeking to shift the blame from Russia to the West for a growing world food crisis that has been worsened by Ukraine’s inability to ship millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products while under attack.
Putin told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi that Moscow “is ready to make a significant contribution to overcoming the food crisis through the export of grain and fertilizer on the condition that politically motivated restrictions imposed by the West are lifted,” according to the Kremlin.
Western officials have dismissed the Russian claims. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has noted that food, fertilizer and seeds are exempt from the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many others on Russia.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of looting both grain and farm equipment from territories held by its forces. A Russia-installed official in southern Ukraine has confirmed that grain from last year’s harvest there is being sent to buyers in Russia, according to a report Monday by Russia’s Tass state news agency.
That grain, however, isn’t making its way to Africa. In Cameroon, baker Sylvester Ako says he’s seen his daily clientele drop from 300 customers a day to only 100 since bread prices jumped 40% because of the lack of wheat imports.
He’s already let three of his seven employees go, and worries that he will have to shutter his business in Yaounde, the capital, entirely unless something changes.
“The price of a 50-kilogram [110-pound] bag of wheat now sells at $60 — up from about $30 — and the supply is not regular,” Ako said.

In a tranquil Ukrainian monastery, dozens driven from homes by war find refuge. The nuns say they will offer shelter as long as it’s needed.

Along with the shortfall in wheat imports, the African Development Bank is also warning of a potential 20% decline in food production on the continent because farmers are having to pay 300% more for their imported fertilizer.
The organization says it plans to address the issues through a $1.5-billion plan that will provide farmers in Africa with certified seeds, fertilizer and other help. Reducing dependence on foreign imports is part of the strategy, but those economic transitions are likely to take years, not months.
Senegal’s president says appetites can pivot more quickly. He’s encouraging Africans to consume local grains that were once the staples of their diets.
“We must also change our eating habits,” Sall said. ”We dropped millet and started importing rice from Asia. Now we only know how to eat rice and we don’t produce enough. We only know how to eat bread. We do not produce wheat.”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-30/pimco-fund-added-to-russia-swap-exposure-in-weeks-before-war;2022-05-31;Pimco fund added to Russia swap exposure in weeks before war - Los Angeles Times;"Pacific Investment Management Co.’s largest fund increased its exposure to Russian default swaps in the run-up to the country’s invasion of Ukraine by selling more than $100 million of protection to banks that include Barclays and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
At the start of the year, Pimco’s Income Fund already had almost $1 billion of bets on Russia via credit default swaps, and it added a net $106 million to that in the first quarter of 2022, according to fund documents filed this month with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bulk of the new swaps were sold in January, with some added in February before the war began, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The exposure leaves Pimco as one of the biggest players in this week’s drama over whether Russia’s credit default swaps will pay out — a question that has been top of mind for many debt investors  since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Pimco is part of a panel of dealers and investors that’s set to meet Tuesday to decide whether the swaps should be triggered by Russia’s failure to include $1.9 million in extra interest on a payment made earlier this month.
The credit default swaps act as insurance contracts that Pimco would pay out to counterparties if Russia is deemed to have failed to pay its debts. That may not translate into major additional losses, as Pimco has already significantly written down its Russia positions, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing specific investments. Those markdowns have contributed to the fund’s 6% drop so far this year, though that’s a smaller decline than the fund’s benchmark.
Technology and the Internet
On TikTok and Instagram, pregnant women find themselves targeted with videos that prey on their worst fears as expectant mothers, from birth defects to child loss. For some, quitting social media is the only solution.

Pimco’s Russia holdings were reduced by two-thirds during the first quarter and accounted for less than 1% of the fund’s $128 billion of assets, with credit default swap positions making up a small portion, Michael Reid, a Pimco spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.
“While Russian external and local bonds have been marked down significantly, the fund benefited from some of the positions getting redeemed at par, such as Gazprom,” Reid said.
Russia sovereign debt has plunged in value since the war began, and trading on credit default swaps indicates about a 90% chance that the country will default on its foreign debt within the next year. Credit default swaps covered a net $3.1 billion of Russian debt as of last month, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.
It’s possible that Pimco made money on other trades linked to Russia. The ruble has rallied almost 20% against the dollar this year, while energy prices have soared. It’s also possible that the bonds it would receive to settle credit default swaps could rise in value, though a top global lawyer in sovereign debt litigation said it’s unlikely that holders of Russian government bonds would be left with a viable path to recover their money if the country defaults.

As part of Pimco’s additional exposure to Russian swaps, the money manager sold about $77 million notional to Barclays, $31 million to JPMorgan and more than $7 million to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in the first quarter, the documents show. Pimco also owned more than $1 billion of Russian corporate and sovereign debt at the start of the year.
The Russia exposure amounts to a small part of the $2.2 trillion that Newport Beach-based Pimco managed at the end of 2021. Still, the losses have added to a difficult period in markets that saw clients of the firm, which is owned by German insurer Allianz, pull 13.6 billion euros ($14.6 billion) of assets in the first quarter."

Ukraine’s leader made a rare front-line visit to the city of Kharkiv as he sought to assess the strength of the country’s defenses.
Russian forces stormed Severodonetsk after trying unsuccessfully to encircle the strategic city, Ukrainian officials said, creating a situation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  called “indescribably difficult.” He said a relentless Russian artillery barrage had destroyed the town’s critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of its buildings.
“Capturing Severodonetsk is a principal task for the occupation force,” Zelensky said, adding that the Russians don’t care about casualties.
The mayor said the fighting had knocked out power and cellphone service and forced a humanitarian relief center to shut down because of the dangers.
The deteriorating conditions raised fears that Severodonetsk could become the next Mariupol, a city on the Sea of Azov that spent nearly three months under Russian siege before the last Ukrainian fighters surrendered.
Severodonetsk,   about 90 miles south of the Russian border, has emerged in recent days as the epicenter of Moscow’s quest to capture all of Ukraine’s eastern industrial Donbas region. Russia also stepped up its efforts to capture the nearby city Lysychansk, where civilians rushed to escape persistent shelling.
The two eastern cities span the strategically important Seversky Donets River. They are the last major areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, which makes up the Donbas together with the adjacent Donetsk region.
Zelensky, meanwhile, visited soldiers in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, where Ukrainian fighters pushed Russian forces back from nearby positions several weeks ago.

“I feel boundless pride in our defenders. Every day, risking their lives, they fight for Ukraine’s freedom,” Zelensky wrote on the Telegram messaging app after the visit.
Russia has kept up its bombardment of the northeastern city from afar, and explosions could be heard shortly after Zelensky’s visit. Shelling and airstrikes have destroyed more than 2,000 apartment buildings in the city since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov.
In a video address later Sunday, Zelensky praised Kharkiv regional officials but said he had fired the regional head of  Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, for his poor performance. In the wider Kharkiv region, Russian troops still held about one-third of the territory, Zelensky said.
After failing to seize Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, Russia is focused on occupying parts of the Donbas not already controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told French TF1 television Sunday that Moscow’s “unconditional priority is the liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” adding that Russia sees them as “independent states.”
He also suggested other regions of Ukraine should be able to establish close ties with Russia.
But in Luhansk, constant Russian shelling has created what provincial Gov. Serhiy Haidai called a “severe situation.”
“There are fatalities and wounded people,” he wrote on Telegram. On Saturday, he said, one civilian died and four were injured after a Russian shell hit a high-rise apartment building.
But some Luhansk supply and evacuation routes functioned Sunday, he said. He said the Russians had retreated “with losses” around a village near Severodonetsk but conducted airstrikes on another nearby river village.
Civilians who reached the eastern city of Pokrovsk,  about 80 miles southwest of Lysychansk, said they held out as long as they could before fleeing the Russian advance.








Yanna Skakova choked back tears as she described leaving with her 18-month and 4-year-old sons while her husband stayed behind to take care of their house and animals. The family was among 18 people who lived in a basement for the last 2½ months until police told them Friday that it was time to evacuate.
“None of us wanted to leave our native city,” she said. “But for the sake of these small children, we decided to leave.”
Severodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk said there was fighting at the city’s bus station Saturday. Residents risked exposure to shelling to get water from a half-dozen wells, and there was no electricity or cellphone service, Striuk said.
Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians in the city, which had a prewar population of around 100,000, have died in Russian attacks since the beginning of the war, as well as from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn’t be treated.
The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, questioned the Kremlin’s strategy of assembling a huge military effort to take Severodonetsk, saying it was proving costly for Russia and would bring few returns.
“When the  [battle] ends, regardless of which side holds the city, the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will likely have culminated, giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back,” the institute said in an assessment published late Saturday.
There are concerns that Severodonetsk could become the next Mariupol.

Hungary has declared a legal “state of danger” in response to the war in neighboring Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban says.
An aide to Mariupol’s Ukrainian mayor said Sunday that after Russia’s forces gained complete control of Mariupol, they piled bodies  in a supermarket in the occupied city.
The aide, Petro Andryushchenko, posted a photo on the Telegram messaging app of what he described as a “corpse dump.” It showed bodies stacked alongside closed supermarket counters.
It was not immediately possible to verify his account or the authenticity of the photo, which Andryushchenko described as recent.
“Here the Russians bring the bodies of the dead, which were washed out of their graves during attempts to restore the water supply, and partially exhumed. They just dump them like garbage,” he wrote.

In Lysychansk, Luhansk Gov. Haidai said constant shelling created a “severe” situation. “There are fatalities and wounded people,” he wrote on Telegram, without elaborating.
On Saturday, he said, one civilian died and four were injured after a Russian shell hit a high-rise apartment building.

Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors have benefited as the war in Ukraine and China’s military ambitions foster support for military spending.
The Ukrainian military said Sunday that Russian forces also were trying to strengthen their positions around Lyman, a small city that serves as a key rail hub in the Donetsk region.
Moscow claimed Saturday to have taken Lyman, but Ukrainian authorities said their fighters remained engaged in combat in parts of the city.
“The enemy is reinforcing its units,” the Ukrainian armed forces’  general  staff said in an operational update. “It is trying to gain a foothold in the area.”
The Ukrainian army said that heavy fighting was ongoing around Donetsk, the provincial capital.
More widely, Russia launched renewed airstrikes overnight on Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, and in central Ukraine, Ukrainian state agencies said.
The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said Sunday morning that Russian shelling caused fires around Kharkiv.
The Kharkiv regional prosecutors’ office said a Russian shell broke through the room of a house and wounded a 50-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman early Sunday in the town of Zolochiv, around 20 miles northwest of Kharkiv.
The Ukrainian Border Guard Service said border areas in the Sumy region, east of Kharkiv, were hit with six unguided missiles. The agency did not mention reports of any casualties.
Russia claimed its forces destroyed an important Ukrainian ammunition depot in the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky’s hometown. High-precision missiles struck a depot “within one of the industrial enterprises” in the city, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.
Ukrainian emergency services confirmed that “an industrial plant” in Kryvyi Rih caught fire after being struck by two Russian rockets and sustaining “significant damage.” Officials did not say whether it was being used as a military depot."

Russian forces have launched a campaign to encircle Severodonetsk — the easternmost point of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control — along with its sister city, Lysychansk, just to the south.
By Tuesday morning, after days of withering artillery duels along the eastern front, Russian troops were reported to have seized portions of Lyman, a town roughly 30 miles west of Severodonetsk, and blitzed into the village of Zolote,  south of Lysychansk. Those attacks and a Russian stab from north of Severodonetsk form a three-pronged offensive to take the city.
“The intensity of fire on Severodonetsk has increased by multiple times — they are simply destroying the city,” Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said in a TV interview. He echoed Zelensky’s overnight address to the nation, which accused Russian forces of “trying to destroy all living things” in the east.
“Literally,” Zelensky said. “Nobody destroyed Donbas as the Russian military does now.”
At the same time, authorities in Mariupol, which Russia now controls in its most significant gain of the war, announced the gruesome discovery of 200 bodies in the basement of a collapsed apartment building. Russia’s onslaught has left the southeastern port city nearly obliterated.
Zelensky also cited a Russian missile barrage that struck the village of Desna last week in northern Ukraine, killing 87 people in one of the war’s deadliest single attacks, as he appealed for more arms from the U.S. and other supportive nations.

The 21-year-old soldier had pleaded guilty to fatally shooting a Ukrainian civilian, which he said was an order from a superior officer.

“Every time we tell our partners that we need modern antimissile weapons, modern combat aircraft, we are not just making a formal request,” he said. “We say that our request is the real lives of many people who would not have died if we had received all the weapons we are seeking.”

Meanwhile, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday that Russian airstrikes destroyed a depot in the Donbas used to store U.S.-produced M777 howitzer artillery shells. The United States has fast-tracked deliveries of the artillery to Ukraine in recent weeks as part of a larger lend-lease program.
The ministry also said Russian sappers had de-mined a section of the coast of the Sea of Azov adjacent to the port of Mariupol, the Russian news agency Tass reported.
Even amid the deteriorating military situation in the east, signs of prewar life were returning to other parts of Ukraine. In Kharkiv, the target of a recently repulsed Russian onslaught that forced authorities to turn the northeastern city’s metro system into a bomb shelter, subways were running again, said Mayor Igor Terekhov on the messaging app Telegram.
World & Nation
It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.


A sense of normality has also come to the capital, Kyiv, just two months after Russian tanks were massing on its outskirts. Ukrainian forces managed to keep them out, forcing Moscow to withdraw and redeploy its troops to the east.
Despite the military setbacks in the Donbas, a feeling of triumph seems prevalent in Kyiv as those who fled the city in the early days of the war pour back. In recent days, residents have come out in large numbers to view a public war trophy: the remnants of destroyed Russian tanks and other Russian war paraphernalia put on display in central St. Michael’s Square, in front of the majestic golden-domed church honoring the saint.
In a carnival-like atmosphere, people take selfies with the military ruins and hoist children and pets atop the charred tanks. Signs at the site implore other nations to aid Ukraine in its bid to drive back its behemoth neighbor.
“It’s a bit scary, the smell of death,” said Anna Ursu, 22, who came to see the battered tanks Tuesday with her 2-year-old daughter. “At the same time, there is joy that these were destroyed by our defenders. It is because of them that we are able to be here looking at this.”
Accompanying her was a friend, Nadia Reznikova, 23, originally from the battered Luhansk province. Luhansk and Donetsk provinces make up the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland.
“Yes, the battle in the east is hard, but I believe Ukraine will triumph, especially if NATO closes the skies,” said Reznikova, referring to a common wish among Ukrainians — that the U.S.-led alliance impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine to thwart Russian air power.

President Biden and other Western leaders have rejected such a move, fearing it would lead to direct fighting between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russian forces and the possibility of nuclear war.
“We can only hope,” said Reznikova, gazing at the destroyed Russian war machines along with her daughter, 4, as the chimes from nearby St. Michael’s played the Ukrainian national anthem. “I am hopeful we will be victorious.”
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba pleaded for more military aid, saying Ukrainian troops needed multiple-launch rocket systems, long-range artillery and armored personnel carriers.
“Russian offensive in the Donbas is a ruthless battle, the largest one on European soil since WWII. I urge partners to speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition,” Kuleba tweeted Tuesday.
Also Tuesday, Kuleba spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, about the Russian seaport blockade of Ukrainian food exports, including wheat and other grains, which threatens to starve numerous populations worldwide.
Russia has positioned warships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to prevent Ukraine from exporting grains, cooking oil and fertilizers to the world, sending prices soaring and shortages spreading. Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly a third of the global wheat supply.
At least 25 million tons of wheat are trapped in Ukraine, according to the United Nations, leading Blinken to accuse Russia of weaponizing food and holding supplies “hostage” for its military benefit.

As Russia fines and arrests citizens for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, people are turning to coded messages.


While on a swing through Asia this week, President Biden signed bipartisan legislation granting an additional $40 billion in assistance to Ukraine. At a summit Tuesday in Tokyo with the leaders of Japan, Australia and India, Biden condemned Russia’s “brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine” for triggering a humanitarian catastrophe.
“We’re navigating a dark hour in our shared history,” Biden said. “The world has to deal with it, and we are.”
Surrounding Severodonetsk would enable Russia to trap Ukrainian troops defending the area and open a path to Kramatorsk, the Ukrainian government’s main administrative and military node in the east.
Despite recent Russian advances, three months of warfare have brought only limited progress for the Kremlin in its plan to take over Ukraine’s east. Russian Defense Secretary Sergei Shoigu chalked up the slow pace to Moscow seeking to limit civilian casualties.
“Cease-fires are being declared and humanitarian corridors are being created in order to get people out of the surrounded settlements,” Shoigu said at a meeting of defense ministers from some former Soviet bloc nations, according to a report from Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency.
“Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but this is done deliberately to avoid casualties among the civilian population,” Shoigu said, adding that Russia would “continue the special military operation” — its term  for the war — “until all tasks are completed.”
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights says almost 4,000 civilians have been killed and more than 4,500 injured since Russia launched its invasion Feb. 24. Those figures are  probably undercounts, the agency says.
The war has also left many of Ukraine’s major cities and wide swaths of its countryside in ruins.
Russia’s objectives in Ukraine “will be fulfilled” without worrying about deadlines, Nikolai Patrushev, head of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Security Council, said in an interview Tuesday with a Russian weekly newspaper, adding that “Nazism must either be 100% eradicated, or it will rear its head in a few years, and in an even uglier form.”
Moscow falsely claims that Ukraine is controlled by a cabal of neo-Nazis who have orchestrated a genocide of the country’s ethnic Russian population.

In a video on social media, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the war in Ukraine represented “a constant threat to Hungary” that was “putting our physical security at risk and threatening the energy and financial security of our economy and families.”
In response, he said, a “war state of danger” would take effect beginning Wednesday, allowing the government “to respond immediately and protect Hungary and Hungarian families by any means possible.”
The move came after Orban’s ruling party passed a constitutional amendment Tuesday allowing for legal states of danger to be declared when armed conflicts, wars or humanitarian disasters were taking place in neighboring countries.
The special legal order permits the government to enact laws by decree without parliamentary oversight, and permits the temporary suspension of and deviation from existing laws.
Hungary’s government implemented similar measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to outcry from critics and legal observers, who argued they gave the government authority to rule by decree. That special legal order was set to expire on June 1.
World & Nation
Right-wing Hungarian leader Viktor Orban is facing more pressure than ever to choose between Moscow and Hungary’s Western partners in the EU and NATO.

Orban’s government has been accused of eroding democratic freedoms in Hungary since he took office in 2010, and using state resources to cement power. The governing Fidesz party won a fourth-straight election victory on April 3, giving Orban, the longest-serving leader in the European Union, an additional four-year term.

In a statement Tuesday, Emese Pasztor of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union wrote that Hungary’s government was “once again adapting the rules of the game to its own needs.”
“By always allowing the possibility of introducing a special legal order in the future, it will lose its special character. It will become the new normal, which will threaten the fundamental rights of all of us, and rule by decree will further diminish the importance of parliament,” Pasztor wrote.
World & Nation
Emboldened by a crushing win at the polls, Hungary’s Putin-friendly leader could crack the West’s united front over Ukraine. Is that his aim?


Governmental decrees issued through the special legal order are valid for 15 days unless extended by Hungary’s parliament. Orban’s Fidesz party has held a two-thirds majority in parliament since 2010."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-24/ukraine-war-us-aid-congress;2022-05-24;Jonah Goldberg: Why do Democrats and Republicans agree on Ukraine aid? - Los Angeles Times;"During the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden was outspoken in his desire to “revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country.”
On May 15, Politico reported that, at the urging of many advisors, Biden had mostly given up on working with the GOP, which he purportedly now “views as an existential threat to the nation’s democracy.”
Four days later, Biden enjoyed the biggest bipartisan victory of his presidency. Talk about timing.
The historic $40-billion aid package for Ukraine was, as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell predicted, “a big bipartisan landslide.” Just shy of 80% of Republican senators voted for it.
Opinion
Conservatives’ obsession with the “elite” media’s alleged monopoly over the news has intensified even as that monopoly has unraveled.

Biden did “applaud the Congress for sending a clear bipartisan message to the world” in a written statement as he left for Asia. But he hasn’t boasted about delivering on his promise of bipartisanship.
Meanwhile, other leading Democrats think the real story are the Republicans who voted against the Ukraine package. “It is beyond troubling to see a growing circle of Senate Republicans proudly oppose Ukrainian funding,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Thursday. “It appears more and more MAGA Republicans are on the same soft-on-Putin playbook that we saw used by former President Trump.”
Schumer has a point — the share of Republicans opposing Biden’s requests for support has grown; only three House Republicans objected to Biden’s initial statement of support for Ukraine in March.

But Schumer’s focus on the rump group that lost the vote illustrates why few in either party want to tout their bipartisanship. There’s very little incentive, particularly heading into the midterms, to brag about working with the enemy. The base just doesn’t want to hear it.
This has been a dynamic in Washington for a long time. When members of Congress work on a bipartisan basis, they like to do it as under the radar as possible, to avoid seeming like sellouts to the parties’ respective bases that see any compromise or collegiality as cowardly surrender.
Opinion
K. see hundreds of dead Russian bodies in refrigerated trucks in Ukraine and with no one taking them back to Russia for burial. D. hears that many people in Latvia, where he has moved, support Putin.

Some call this the “secret” or “shadow” Congress. In an era of hyperpartisanship, if you want to get something done, the best thing you can do is not make a big deal about it. It’s a zero-sum calculation — if one party can declare a victory, the other party sees it as a loss. That’s both why Biden rarely boasts of the “bipartisan” in his “Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill” win (officially the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and why the Republicans who voted for it have been treated like traitors by the base.
“All Republicans who voted for Democratic longevity should be ashamed of themselves!” Trump declared in November. That Trump desperately wanted an infrastructure bill when he was president shows how partisanship is a bigger priority than policy.
Still, in such a climate, one might wonder, why did Republicans overwhelmingly support the Ukrainian aid package? The most important, and obvious, reason is that it was necessary on the merits. A second reason is that a huge majority of Americans — including Republicans — support helping Ukraine any way possible short of sending troops. Republican approval of Biden’s handling of Ukraine is low, but that probably reflects Republican disapproval of Biden generally. Indeed, Republicans have often been more likely to say Biden has been too weak on Ukraine.
There’s a third answer that doesn’t fit a popular narrative among Democrats and many in the media.
Despite decades of handwringing to the contrary, the GOP is not an isolationist party, a fact Trump often learned to his consternation in the White House as he was forced to sign Russian sanctions and intervene militarily in the Middle East.
Even among the opponents of helping Ukraine, most argue that the U.S. should focus on confronting China instead, hardly an isolationist argument. Others hide behind newly discovered concerns about fiscal or procedural propriety. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a leading noninterventionist, claimed that he merely wanted an inspector general to oversee the spending of the aid money.
It’s true that there is a loud noninterventionist or “realist” bloc on the right, increasingly — and surprisingly — led by the Heritage Foundation and unsurprisingly by various instruments of the Koch network. But such efforts are hardly new, even if they are often treated that way.
Indeed, one might ask, why are Democrats so supportive of Biden’s effort? The most important answer to that question is the same for Democrats, too: It’s necessary and popular. But the fact that Biden is president is probably a big part of it as well.
After all, when Vladimir Putin seized Crimea, Democrats rallied to President Obama’s fairly tepid response. Partisanship works wonders.

Despite the attacks, some managed to make it to the town of Pokrovsk, 80 miles to the south, and boarded an evacuation train Saturday heading west, away from the fighting.
Fighting has raged around Lysychansk and neighboring Severodonetsk, the last major cities under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region. Luhansk and the Donetsk region to its south make up the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, which is the focus of Russia’s current offensive. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas for eight years and Russian forces are now trying to capture at least the whole Donbas.
Bouncing her 18-month-old son on her lap, Yana Skakova choked back tears as she described living in a basement under relentless bombing, and having to leave her husband behind when she fled with her baby and 4-year-old son.
Initially after the war broke out, there were quiet times when they could come out of the basement to cook in the street and let the children play outdoors. But about a week ago, the bombing intensified. For the past five days, they hadn’t been able to venture out of the basement at all.
“Now the situation is bad, it’s scary to go out,” she said.
It was the police who came to evacuate them Friday from the basement where 18 people, including nine children, had been living for the past 2½ months.
“We were sitting there, then the traffic police came and they said: ‘You should evacuate as fast as possible, since it is dangerous to stay in Lysychansk now,’” Skakova said.
Despite the bombings and the lack of electricity, gas and water, nobody really wanted to go.

“None of us wanted to leave our native city,” she said. “But for the sake of these small children, we decided to leave.”
She broke down in tears as she described how her husband stayed behind to take care of their house and animals.
“Yehor is 1½ years old, and now he’s without a father,” Skakova said.
Oksana, 74, who was too afraid to give her surname, said she was evacuated from Lysychansk on Friday by a team of foreign volunteers along with her 86-year-old husband. There were still other people left behind in the city, she said, including young children.
Sitting on the same evacuation train as Skakova, she broke down and cried. The tears came hard and fast as she described leaving her home for an uncertain future.
“I’m going somewhere, not knowing where,” she said as she wept. “Now I am a beggar without happiness. Now I have to ask for charity. It would be better to kill me.”
She had worked for 36 years as an accountant, a civil servant, she said, and the thought of now having to rely on others was unbearable.
“God forbid anyone else suffers this. It’s a tragedy. It’s a horror,” she cried. “Who knew I would end up in such a hell?”"

The Russian Defense Ministry said Lyman, the second small city to fall to Russia this week, had been “completely liberated” by a joint force of Russian soldiers and Kremlin-backed separatists, who have waged war for eight years in the industrial Donbas region bordering Russia.
Ukraine’s train system has ferried arms and evacuated citizens through Lyman, a key railway hub in the country’s east. Control of it also would give Russia’s military another foothold in the region; it has bridges for troops and equipment to cross the Seversky Donets River, which has so far impeded the Russian advance into the Donbas.
Ukrainian officials have sent mixed signals on Lyman. On Friday, Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said Russian troops controlled most of it and were trying to press their offensive toward Bakhmut, another city in the region. On Saturday, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar disputed Moscow’s claim that Lyman had fallen, saying fighting there was still ongoing.
In his Saturday video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation in the east as “very complicated’’ and said the “Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result’’ by focusing its efforts there.
The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of Western weapons to Ukraine and blamed the conflict’s disruption to global food supplies on Western sanctions.
World & Nation
The stepped-up attacks come as Russian President Vladimir Putin orders new initiatives to try to solidify Moscow’s gains and secure new ones.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron urged an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of Russian troops, according to the chancellor’s spokesperson. Both urged Putin to engage in serious direct negotiations with  Zelensky to end the fighting, the spokesperson said.
A Kremlin readout of the call with Macron, Putin and Scholz said the Russian leader affirmed “the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue.” The three leaders agreed to stay in contact, according to the readout.

But Russia’s recent progress in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces that make up the Donbas, could further embolden Putin. Since failing to occupy Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, Russia has set out to seize the last parts of the region not controlled by the separatists.
“If Russia did succeed in taking over these areas, it would highly likely be seen by the Kremlin as a substantive political achievement and be portrayed to the Russian people as justifying the invasion,” the British Ministry of Defense said in a Saturday assessment.
Russia has intensified efforts to capture the larger cities of Severodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk, which are the last major areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province. Zelensky called the situation in the east “difficult” but expressed confidence his country would prevail with help from Western weapons and sanctions.
“If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian,” he said.
World & Nation
As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, Russian forces appear to be on the cusp of a breakthrough in the contested Donbas region.

The governor of Luhansk reported that Ukrainian fighters repelled an assault on Severodonetsk but Russian troops still pushed to encircle them. Speaking on Ukrainian TV later Saturday, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had seized a hotel on the outskirts of Severodonetsk.
Severodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk said Friday that some 1,500 civilians in the city with a prewar population of around 100,000 have died there during the war, including from a lack of medicine or because of diseases that could not be treated.
The advance of Russian forces raised fears that residents would experience the same horrors as people in the southeastern port city Mariupol in the weeks before it fell. Residents who had not yet fled faced the choice of risking it now or staying behind.
Just south of Severodonetsk, AP reporters saw elderly and ill civilians bundled into soft stretchers and slowly carried down apartment building stairs Friday in Bakhmut.
Svetlana Lvova, the manager of two buildings in Bakhmut, tried to convince reluctant residents to leave but said she and her husband would not evacuate until their son, who was in Severodonetsk, returned home.
“I have to know he is alive. That’s why I’m staying here,” Lvova, 66, said.

Ukrainian officials warn that without more foreign-supplied weapons two cities crucial to Russia’s capture of all of the Donbas will soon fall.


On Saturday, people who managed to flee Lysychansk described intensified shelling, especially over the past week, that left them unable to leave basement bomb shelters at all.
Yanna Skakova said she left the city Friday with her 18-month-old and 4-year-old sons. She cried as she sat on a train bound for western Ukraine. She said her husband stayed behind to take care of their house and animals.
“It’s too dangerous to stay there now,” she said, wiping away tears.
A nearly three-month siege of Mariupol ended last week when Russia claimed complete control of the city. Mariupol became a symbol of mass destruction and human suffering, as well as of Ukrainian determination to defend the country.
Mariupol’s port has reportedly resumed operations after Russian forces finished clearing mines in the Azov Sea off the once-vibrant city. Russian state news agency Tass reported that a vessel bound for the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don entered Mariupol’s seaport early Saturday.
The Kremlin said that Putin had emphasized to Macron and Scholz that Russia was working to “establish a peaceful life in Mariupol and other liberated cities in the Donbas.”
Ukrainian authorities have reported that Kremlin-installed officials in seized cities have started airing Russian news broadcasts, introduced Russian area codes, imported Russian school curriculum and taken other steps to annex the areas.
Russian-held areas of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region have switched to Moscow time and “will no longer switch to daylight-saving time, as is customary in Ukraine,” Russia’s state RIA Novosti agency quoted Krill Stremousov, a Russian-installed local official, as saying Saturday.
The war in Ukraine has caused global food shortages because the country is a major exporter of grain and other commodities. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations over which side was responsible for keeping shipments tied up in ports, with Russia saying Ukrainian sea mines prevented safe passage and Ukraine citing a Russian naval blockade.
The media service of the Ukrainian Naval Forces said two Russian missile carriers “capable of carrying up to 16 missiles” were ready for action in the Black Sea. It said that only shipping routes that had been established through multilateral treaties could be considered safe.
As Ukraine attempts to fend off the Russian invasion, the country’s officials have pressed Western nations for more sophisticated and powerful weapons. The U.S. Defense Department would not confirm a Friday CNN report saying the Biden administration was preparing to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine.
Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Anatoliy Antonov, on Saturday branded such a move as “unacceptable” and called on the Biden administration to “abandon statements about the military victory of Ukraine.”
A Telegram post published on the Russian embassy’s official channel cited Moscow’s top diplomat in Washington as saying “the unprecedented pumping of weapons into Ukraine significantly increases the risks of an escalation of the conflict.”

Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.


Moscow is also trying to spook Sweden and Finland’s determination to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its navy successfully launched a new hypersonic missile from the Barents Sea. The ministry said the recently developed Zircon hypersonic cruise missile had struck its target about 620 miles away.
If confirmed, the launch could spell trouble for NATO voyages in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Zircon, described as the world’s fastest non-ballistic missile, can be armed with either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, and is said to be impossible to stop with current anti-missile defense systems.
Moscow’s claims, which could not be immediately verified, came a week after Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia would form new military units in the west of the country in response to Sweden and Finland’s bids to join NATO."

Austin III told reporters.
And Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that “low-level” discussion is underway on how the U.S. may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces and on whether some U.S. troops should be based in Ukraine.
The U.S. withdrew its few troops in Ukraine before the war and has no plans to send in combat forces. Milley’s comments left open the possibility that troops could return for embassy security or another noncombat role.
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has partially reopened and is staffing up again, and there have been questions about whether the U.S. will send a Marine security force back in to help protect the embassy, or if other options should be considered.
Asked if U.S. special operations forces may go into Ukraine, which officials have insisted they are not doing yet, Milley said that “any reintroduction of U.S. forces into Ukraine would require a presidential decision. So we’re a ways away from anything like that.”
Speaking to Pentagon reporters, Austin declined to say whether the U.S. will send Ukraine high-tech mobile rocket launchers, which it has requested. But Austin said that some 20 nations announced Monday that they will send new packages of security assistance to Ukraine, as its war with Russia reaches the three-month mark.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls for maximum sanctions against Russia in a virtual speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

In particular, he said that Denmark has agreed to send a harpoon launcher and missiles to Ukraine to help Ukraine defend its coast. Russia has ships in the Black Sea and has used them to launch cruise missiles into Ukraine. The Russian ships have also stopped all commercial ship traffic from entering Ukrainian ports.

“We’ve gained a sharper, shared sense of Ukraine’s priority requirements and the situation on the battlefield,” Austin told reporters at the close of the virtual meeting with the defense leaders. “Many countries are donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defense systems and tanks and other armored vehicles. Others came forward with new commitments for training.”
The U.S. and other countries have been training Ukrainian forces in nearby European countries.

It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.


Austin added that the Czech Republic recently donated attack helicopters, tanks and rockets, and that Italy, Greece, Norway and Poland announced new donations Monday of artillery systems and ammunition.
“The nature of the fight, as you’ve heard us describe a number of times is ... really shaped by artillery in this phase,” Austin said. “And we’ve seen serious exchanges of artillery fires over the last several weeks.”
Austin said that during the virtual meeting, Ukrainian officials made clear their security needs. And he said those are consistent with what has been identified in recent weeks — long-range artillery and rocket systems, armored personnel carriers and drones.

Hundreds or possibly thousands of foreign nationals have swooped into Ukraine to join the battle against the Russians.

Milley provided the greatest detail to date on the increased U.S. presence in Europe since Russia invaded in late February. Last fall there were roughly 78,000 U.S. troops in the region, and that has gone up to 102,000 — including 24 surface ships, four submarines, 12 fighter jet squadrons, two combat aviation units, and six Army brigade combat teams, along with their division and corps leaderships."

Zelensky said sanctions needed to go further to stop Russian aggression, including an oil embargo, blocking all of its banks and cutting off trade with Russia completely. He said that it would be a precedent that would work for decades to come.
“This is what sanctions should be: They should be maximum, so that Russia and every other potential aggressor that wants to wage a brutal war against its neighbor would clearly know the immediate consequences of their actions,” Zelensky said through a translator.
He also pushed for the complete withdrawal of foreign companies from Russia to prevent supporting its war and said Ukraine needed funding — at least $5 billion per month.
“The amount of work is enormous: We have more than half a trillion of dollars in losses; tens of thousands of facilities were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities and industries,” Zelensky said, days after the Group of 7 leading economies agreed to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid. The U.S. has also approved $40 billion more in aid to the government in Kyiv.
He said that if Ukraine had “received 100% of our needs at once, back in February,” in terms of weapons, funding, political support and sanctions against Russia, “the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved.”

Zelensky’s speech was a key focus Monday at Davos, the village in the Swiss Alps that has been transformed into a glitzy venue for the four-day confab ostensibly dedicated to making the world a better place. The event is resuming in person after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also delayed this year’s meeting from its usual winter slot.
For the attendees, there’s much to tackle amid soaring food and fuel prices, Russia’s war in Ukraine, climate change, inequality and persistent health crises. But it’s hard to predict if the high-minded discussions will yield substantial announcements that make headway on the world’s most pressing challenges.

“This war is really a turning point of history, and it will reshape our political and our economic landscape in the coming years,” said the event’s founder, Klaus Schwab.
Zelensky, who received a standing ovation after his remarks, reiterated that Russia was blocking critical food supplies, such as wheat and sunflower oil, from leaving its ports, and also stealing some.

The 21-year-old soldier had pleaded guilty to fatally shooting a Ukrainian civilian, which he said was an order from a superior officer.


Ukraine, along with Russia, is a major exporter of wheat, barley and sunflower oil, and the interruption of those supplies is threatening food insecurity in countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia.
The head of the United Nations World Food Program called for Ukraine’s ports to reopen, saying the region’s farmers “grow enough food to feed 400 million people.”
If such supplies remain off the market, the world could face a food availability problem in the next 10 to 12 months, and “that is going to be hell on earth,” World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley told the Associated Press.
He warned that there were “49 million [people] knocking on famine’s door right now in 43 countries,” including Yemen, Lebanon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Congo, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Beasley called on the world’s top mega-billionaires to aid efforts to prevent hunger: “The world is in real serious trouble. This is not rhetoric and B.S. Step up now, because the world needs you.”
There’s a sizable Ukrainian government delegation attending the Davos forum in person, making its case for more Western support in the country’s fight against Russia.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko pointed to the audience during a panel with his brother, Wladimir, and said: “We are defending you personally.”
“We are fighting, first of all, for values” and to be part of the democratic world, the Ukrainian capital’s mayor said. “And right now everyone has to be proactive because we pay for that — the biggest prize, human lives every day.”

Russia scores its first major win with the takeover of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But will it change the course of the war?

Russian officials have not been invited to Davos this year, with what was dubbed the Russia House having been transformed by critics — including Ukrainian tycoon Victor Pinchuk and the country’s Foreign Ministry — into what they call the “Russia War Crimes House.” The venue features photos of crimes and cruelties that Russian forces are accused of inflicting.
Meanwhile, the head of the International Energy Agency urged countries and investors not to use energy shocks from the war as a reason to increase fossil-fuel investments — connecting the invasion to another major theme at Davos: climate and environmental issues.
“We should not try to justify a new wave of long-term fossil-fuel investments on the basis of what [Russian President Vladimir] Putin did,” Fatih Birol said on an energy panel.
Instead, efficiencies, such as reducing leaked methane and even lowering thermostats by a few degrees this winter in Europe would help ensure adequate energy supply.
Russia is a major supplier of oil and natural gas, with the invasion sending European countries scrambling to reduce their reliance on Moscow’s supplies."

Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and other makers of military gear have avoided the worst of the broader stock market’s recent seven-week rout, beating the S&P 500 amid a pullback in consumer spending, tightening monetary policy and concern about a potential recession.
Russia’s longer-than-expected war in Ukraine and growing risks posed by China’s military ambitions have fostered support for greater defense outlays in the U.S. and Europe. And those threats won’t disappear overnight, giving defense contractors a bulwark against turmoil elsewhere in the global economy.
“You’re immune from economic shock, because the market for defense goods bears no relation to commercial demand for anything in the civil economy,” said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.
An S&P index of aerospace and defense stocks posted a 6.2% loss this year through Friday’s close compared with the 15% rout sustained by the S&P 500 index. Lockheed Martin, the largest pure-play defense contractor in the U.S., led the group with a 27% rise.
The sector’s comparison would look even better if not for Boeing Co., whose stock has plummeted about 37% this year and has been a drag on the broader group. The largest U.S. aircraft manufacturer has been burning through cash reserves as it wrestles with cost overruns on fixed-price defense contracts, an ongoing halt of 787 Dreamliner deliveries and the 737 Max jet’s stalled return in China, Boeing’s largest overseas market.
Although the defense and aerospace sector may not be doing as well as energy companies, it is in the top fifth of the S&P’s 158 tracked industries.
Defense executives have largely played down the near-term financial effects of the Ukraine conflict even as Russia’s brutal invasion pushed shares of several companies to record levels, creating a buffer during the market’s recent skid.
Business
A sanctions regime aimed at putting pressure on Russia’s wealthiest citizens has put a spotlight on the global mega-yacht trade.

Still, the hostilities have triggered a groundswell of military support for Ukraine that will buoy the sales outlook for years. Some 20 nations are sending more weapons to support Ukraine’s defense that eventually will need to be replenished, and spending plans telegraphed by the U.S. and its allies could go higher.

“You’ve had a conflict that a lot of people thought initially it’s over in a week or two,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ken Herbert said in an interview. “That’s obviously not happened. I think it’s taken a while for people to fully appreciate and price in how much upside there really is to spending.”
The Biden administration has sent billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to support Ukraine’s defense forces, including helicopters, drones, artillery and tank-busting Javelin missiles, a joint venture of Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies Corp. A $40-billion package of additional Ukraine aid signed by President Biden on May 21 includes funds to replenish U.S. arms stockpiles.
Germany’s decision to spend more than $100 billion to modernize its armed forces could spur other NATO allies to do likewise, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a March client note. They estimated that every NATO member spending the recommended 2% of GDP on defense would translate to about $80 billion in incremental spending, or a 7% increase to the NATO budget.
The longer-term force driving U.S. defense spending, however, is China, which Defense Department Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks recently called “our military’s most-consequential strategic competitor and pacing challenge.”
Biden has requested to boost the Defense Department’s budget by about $30 billion in 2023. That proposal could have “some upside” potential, Lockheed Martin Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said, because it may not fully account for inflation that the maker of F-35 stealth fighters is seeing. Malave noted that was his personal view.
Speaking at a Bank of America conference on May 19, Malave said the company is “generally pleased” with Biden’s request, though he thinks “once Congress has its say, both the authorizers and appropriators, that it probably can go up from here.”"

Ukraine is one of the world’s largest exporters of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, but the war, including a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports, has prevented most of those products from leaving the country, endangering the world food supply.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov sought to shift the blame to Western sanctions Thursday. “We accuse Western countries of taking a series of unlawful actions that has led to the blockade,” he said.
Western officials dismiss Russia’s claims that sanctions are responsible. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken noted this week that food, fertilizer and seeds are exempt from sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many others — and that Washington is working to ensure that countries know the flow of those goods should not be affected.
With the war grinding on in its fourth month, world leaders ramped up calls for solutions this week.
“This food crisis is real, and we must find solutions,” World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. “If we don’t find solutions, of course the countries that will suffer will be the poorer countries of the world.”

The stepped-up attacks come as Russian President Vladimir Putin orders new initiatives to try to solidify Moscow’s gains and secure new ones.

She said about 25 million tons of Ukrainian grain are presently in storage and another 25 million tons could be harvested next month.

The Russian Defense Ministry proposed Wednesday to open a corridor to allow foreign ships to leave Black Sea ports and another to allow vessels to leave Mariupol — which Russia now controls — on the Sea of Azov. But Russia said the Mariupol port in particular had to be cleared of mines first. Ukraine expressed skepticism about that proposal.
Speaking in Davos, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine was ready to agree on safe corridors in principle — but that it was not sure if it could trust Russia to abide by any agreement.
The issue, he said, was “how to guarantee that the moment we will create this safe passage and the entry to the harbor is de-mined, how to make sure that at night or early in the morning, Russia will not violate the agreement on the safe passage and its military vessels will not sneak into the harbor and attack Odesa.”
World & Nation
It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.

European countries have tried to ease the crisis by bringing grain out of the country by rail. But trains can carry just a small fraction of what Ukraine produces, and ships are needed to do the bulk of the exports.
Mikhail Mizintsev, who heads Russia’s National Defense Control Center, said 70 foreign vessels from 16 countries are now in six ports on the Black Sea, including Odesa, Kherson and Mykolaiv. He did not specify how many might be ready to carry food.
On the battlefield, the General Staff of the Ukrainian military said Thursday that the Russian forces continued attempts to press their offensive in several sections of the front line in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. That industrial heartland of coal mines and factories is now the focus of fighting after Russia suffered a series of setbacks and was forced to pursue more limited goals.
Military officials said Russian forces continued their efforts to gain a foothold in the area of Severodonetsk, which is the only part of the Luhansk region of the Donbas under Ukrainian government control.
They also said Russia launched missile and airstrikes at infrastructure facilities across the country."

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-09/ukraine-team-rubicon-story;2022-05-11;Want to help Ukraine? Bring a needed skill or stay home and send money - Los Angeles Times;"Two days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the World Health Organization issued a global request: The war-torn country needed doctors, nurses and EMTs with experience in complex emergencies.
Within days, a 22-person group from Team Rubicon, an international disaster-response nonprofit based near Los Angeles International Airport, flew to Krakow, Poland.
For the record:
6:25 p.m. May 10, 2022An earlier version of this story said volunteer Lars Whelan is a Coast Guardsman. He is a member of the U.S. Merchant Marine.
The team of doctors, nurses and other skilled professionals drove rented cars about 160 miles to the border. They crossed on foot into Ukraine, where a fleet of vehicles was waiting. Splitting up into smaller groups, they fanned out across the western reaches of the country, visiting hospitals and field clinics.
Team Rubicon has since sent three waves of replacements to Ukraine. Each team has been carefully selected, a key step in the relief effort. Thousands of people around the world want to help in Ukraine, but they don’t have the skills, experience or credentials to work with an international aid organization.
As it’s done in communities in need from Mississippi to Mozambique since its founding 12 years ago, Team Rubicon expects to continue to fuel the response effort in Ukraine for as long as its teams are welcome and can be of assistance.
Which could be a long time.

From a windowless underground bunker in western Ukraine in late March, Dr. Erica Nelson and Dan Freiberg, their faces illuminated only by the light of a laptop screen, gave a live update on their activities while air raid sirens blared above.
As Team Rubicon’s deputy medical director and team lead, respectively, they were part of the organization’s first medical response squad dispatched to Ukraine for three weeks beginning in early March.
“When you have five air raids, you’re pretty limited on how much you can get done, but in the last 24 [hours] I think those guys saw 27 patients,” Freiberg said, referring to a small sub-unit of the team. He had put his job as a fire department captain in Goodyear, Ariz., on hold for the better part of a month to help.
“We’re all trying to use every connection or resource we have to really find places where we can be most effective,” he said. “We’re pretty well prepped and primed for tomorrow. Now we’re spending the night in the shelter.”
Moments before, Brian McAchran had given an update from his post near the Ukrainian border in northeastern Hungary, where his team was treating refugees and training local medical personnel in trauma care. Early in the conflict, Team Rubicon had sent small groups to neighboring Eastern European countries, but it no longer has teams in Hungary, Poland or Moldova.
“Today was a huge success,” said McAchran, a coordination lead for Team Rubicon. “Our doctor Vitaliy [Belyshev] has been down in the clinic two days now … And we identified some issues that we could cross train them in, things that our medical staff are experts in, such as stop the bleed. They set up for that training.”
Every weekday, scenes like these stream in real time from bunkers, hotels and medical facilities in Eastern Europe onto an oversized video screen in a sleek conference room in the nonprofit’s headquarters.
Nelson was on leave from her job as an ER doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. As she spoke from the bunker in western Ukraine, her voice rose over the din of others taking cover from shelling by Russian forces.
“I think even though … we haven’t seen hundreds upon hundreds of patients,” said Nelson, who has provided aid in places including the Palestinian territories, Sudan and Jamaica, “we are hearing that it is important that we’ve been here to support them.”
Most of the patients she and her colleagues have assisted did not have the bullet and shrapnel wounds one might expect. The majority were women and children in need of medical attention for existing conditions such as asthma and diabetes after fleeing their homes elsewhere in the country.
Team Rubicon’s operations in Ukraine are guided by a set of principles aimed at “adding value instead of creating cost,” said Art delaCruz, the organization’s chief executive.
The goal is to find and deploy highly trained, experienced professionals to have as much impact as possible while not being a burden or draining local resources.
“Everyone can get off a sofa and say, ‘I can do this.’ But then the reality is, maybe they can’t,” said delaCruz, a retired naval officer. “If we’re responding to a tornado where a bunch of trees are knocked over, don’t send someone who can’t use a chainsaw when you can send someone who can.”
“When you have five air raids, you’re pretty limited on how much you can get done, but in the last 24 [hours] I think those guys saw 27 patients.”

David Malet, a professor at American University who has published two books on foreign fighters and non-combatants who travel to war zones, agreed.
“A lot of organizations prefer to receive money and resources rather than foreigners who are either inexperienced and can become liabilities or, alternatively, try to shoulder local leadership aside,” he said in an email.
Many who lack the necessary skills give up and find different ways to help the relief effort in Ukraine. Others travel to Eastern Europe on their own, hoping to find a way to lend a hand once they’re on the ground.
“Some people really feel a personal responsibility,” said Ken Keen, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and associate dean for leadership at Emory University’s business school. They “want to do good and want to respond.”
On April 3, Lars Whelan boarded a nonstop LOT Polish Airlines flight from Los Angeles International Airport to Warsaw.
Along with his toothbrush and other standard travel items, the burly, 48-year-old packed a ballistic vest, camouflage clothing and Juno — his toy poodle, known in Whelan’s Hollywood Hills apartment complex for her poof of pink-dyed fur.
For weeks after fighting broke out in Ukraine, Whelan had tried to link up with an aid organization that could put his experience with international logistics, humanitarian aid and crisis management to good use.
“The first thing that I saw was the call for people with specific experience. And what I thought was, ‘I could be really useful,’” he said. “My preference would obviously not be to show up and somebody hands me an AK-47.”
Whelan has managed logistics and security in countries including Gabon and Cameroon. In 2016, he traveled to Greece to help with the arrival of Syrian war refugees. The colorful map over his desk is crisscrossed with lines connecting the dozens of countries he’s been to.
A member of the U.S. Merchant Marine since 1995, Whelan is also a certified medical care provider. And he has helped with Team Rubicon’s COVID-19 response in California, pitching in with relief efforts at food pantries.
So he submitted his name when the group put out a call for qualified professionals. He has not yet been tapped by the organization, or any of the others he reached out to.
David Burke, Team Rubicon’s chief programs officer, said that despite Whelan’s background, he has yet to be a good fit for one of the organization’s teams.
“Prior participation is always valued and appreciated. The rest of the vetting and application process is to make sure we don’t put anyone in situations where they would be uncomfortable and unsafe,” Burke said.
After being turned away by relief groups, Whelan decided to travel to Poland on his own. Two days after he landed in Warsaw, he had already found a way to be useful.
Operating out of the Polish capital’s central train station, he was issued a neon-yellow vest and a paper badge with the word “Volunteer” and its Polish and Ukrainian translations.
As refugees from Ukraine arrived by the hundreds, Whelan — and Juno, who he tucked into his jacket — helped direct them to desks offering services including travel coordination, government resources and temporary housing.
“There’s periods where it slows down,” Whelan said in a WhatsApp message, “and then periods where you have hordes of people trying to get information.”
But even the skills of Team Rubicon’s carefully selected squads are not always used in the ways they expected.
“We came here expecting something that was not the reality, so I think we had to take a beat, and we had to check our assumptions and engage in a very humble, thoughtful way,” Nelson said.
From the dark, eerie bunker, she had some advice for anyone considering travel to Ukraine.
“Don’t just show up,” Nelson said. “There are too many mavericks here. There are too many people who are like, ‘I’m a paramedic, I’m a veteran, I’m going to come here and help.’ Find, legitimize and apply to the right organization.”
Or perhaps stay home.
“Maybe just donating your money to organizations that know what they’re doing and are engaging the community is the best thing to do,” she said."

Putin’s decree applying to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions could allow Russia to strengthen its hold on territory that lies between eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed separatists occupy some areas, and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.
The Russian army is engaged in an intense battle for the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. In a sign that the Kremlin is trying to bolster its stretched military machine, Russian lawmakers agreed to scrap the age limit of 40 for those signing their first voluntary military contracts.
A description of the bill on the website of the State Duma, or parliament, indicated older recruits would be allowed to operate precision weapons or serve in engineering or medical positions. The chair of the State Duma’s defense committee, Andrei Kartapolov, said the measure would make it easier to hire people with “in-demand” skills.
Russian officials say only volunteer contract soldiers are sent to fight in Ukraine, although they acknowledge that some conscripts were put into the fighting by mistake in the early stages of the war.
As Russia’s invasion entered its fourth month, Putin visited a military hospital in Moscow on Wednesday and met with soldiers wounded in Ukraine, the Kremlin said in a statement.
It was his first known visit with soldiers fighting in Ukraine since he launched the war on Feb. 24. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited wounded Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, including children — at times when Russian troops were fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv, the capital.

A reporter for the state-run Russia-1 TV channel posted a video clip on the messaging app Telegram showing Putin in a white medical coat talking to a man in hospital attire, presumably a soldier.
World & Nation
It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.

The man, filmed from behind standing up and with no visible wounds, tells Putin that he has a son. The president, accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, responds: “He will be proud of his father,” before shaking the man’s hand.
Zelensky reiterated Wednesday that he would be willing to negotiate with Putin directly but said Moscow needs to retreat to the positions it held before the invasion and must show it’s ready to “shift from the bloody war to diplomacy.”
“I believe it would be a correct step for Russia to make,” Zelensky told leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, by video link.
He also said Ukraine wants to drive Russian troops out of all captured areas. “Ukraine will fight until it reclaims all its territories,” Zelensky said. “It’s about our independence and our sovereignty.”
In his nightly address to the nation, Zelensky strongly rebuffed those in the West who suggest Ukraine cede control of areas occupied by Russian troops for the sake of reaching a peace agreement.
Those “great geopoliticians” who suggest this are disregarding the interests of ordinary Ukrainians — “the millions of those who actually live on the territory that they propose exchanging for an illusion of peace,” he said. “We always have to think of the people and remember that values are not just words.”
World & Nation
Many ordinary Russians are reeling from blows to their livelihoods, emotions and prospects delivered by the international response to the Ukraine war.

Zelensky compared those who argue for giving Russia a piece of Ukraine to those who in 1938 agreed to cede territory to Adolf Hitler in hopes of preventing World War II.
Russia already had a program to expedite the naturalization of people living in Luhansk and Donetsk, the two eastern Ukrainian provinces that make up the Donbas and where the Moscow-backed separatists hold large areas as self-declared independent republics.
During a visit to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions last week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin indicated they could become part of “our Russian family.”
A Russia-installed official in the Kherson region has predicted it would become part of Russia. An official in Zaporizhzhia said Wednesday that the region’s pro-Kremlin administration would seek that status as well.
Melitopol, the Zaporizhzhia region’s second-largest city, plans to start issuing Russian passports in the near future, said the Russia-installed acting mayor, Galina Danilchenko.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who attended the Davos forum in person, called for friendly countries — particularly the United States — to provide his nation with multiple-launch rocket systems so it could try to recapture lost territory.
“Every day of someone sitting in Washington, Berlin, Paris and other capitals, and considering whether they should or should not do something, costs us lives and territories,” Kuleba said.
Zelensky said his army was facing the fiercest attack possible in the east by Russian forces, which in some places have many more weapons and soldiers. He pleaded for even more military assistance from the West, “without exception, without restrictions. Enough to win.”

Russian bombs wrecked a small museum holding works by one of Ukraine’s best-known artists, Maria Prymachenko. But townspeople rescued a national legacy.

The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, accused Russia of targeting sites sheltering civilians in the city of Severodonetsk.
“The situation is serious,” Haidai said in a written response to questions from the Associated Press. “The city is constantly being shelled with every possible weapon in the enemy’s possession.”
Severodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk are the largest remaining towns held by Ukraine in Luhansk. The region is “more than 90%” controlled by Russia, Haidai said, adding that a key supply route for Kyiv’s troops was coming under pressure despite stiff Ukrainian resistance.
Haidai said that the road between Lysychansk and the city of Bakhmut to the southwest was “constantly being shelled” and that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance teams were approaching.

In a tranquil Ukrainian monastery, dozens driven from homes by war find refuge. The nuns say they will offer shelter as long as it’s needed.

The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said four civilians were injured when two rockets hit the town of Pokrovsk early Wednesday.
One strike left a crater at least  10 feet deep, with the remnants of what appeared to be a rocket still smoldering. A row of low-terraced houses near the strike suffered significant damage.
“There’s no place to live in left. Everything is smashed,” said Viktoria Kurbonova, a mother of two who lived in one of the terraced houses.
A strike about a month ago blew out the windows, which were replaced with plastic sheeting. Kurbonova thinks that probably saved their lives since there was no glass flying around.
World & Nation
The 21-year-old soldier had pleaded guilty to fatally shooting a Ukrainian civilian, which he said was an order from a superior officer.


In other developments, Russia said the strategic Ukrainian port of Mariupol was functional again after a nearly three-month siege that ended with the surrender last week of the last Ukrainian fighters holed up in a giant steel plant. Russia now has full control of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin-backed separatists in Donetsk planned to set up a tribunal to put the fighters on trial and that Moscow welcomes the action.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/sports/newsletter/2022-05-17/ukraine-world-cup-soccer;2022-05-17;Ada Hegerberg keeps her focus on improving women's soccer - Los Angeles Times;"Hello, and welcome to the weekly L.A. Times soccer newsletter. I’m Kevin Baxter, The Times’ soccer writer, and today we wonder why LAFC assistant Ante Razov isn’t yet a head coach, go over the Galaxy’s recent struggles, break down a diverse MLS player pool and look at the two Southern California expansion teams that are at the top of the National Women’s Soccer League table after three weeks.
But we start today with the Ukrainian national team, which faces the unprecedented task of trying to qualify for its first World Cup in 16 years at the same time the nation’s very existence hangs in the balance.
Ukraine continued preparations for its June qualifier in Scotland when it met German club Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday in its first international match since November. A lot has changed since then.
Russia’s senseless and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February has decimated the country, razed cities, killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 14 million, nearly half of whom have fled the country. With the Ukrainian government mustering all men of military age for the war effort, the players on the 23-player national team needed special permission to leave the country and train in the Slovenian Alps.

Yet in its own way, the team’s pursuit of a World Cup berth also has rallied Ukrainians.
“Every day, we receive messages from our soldiers,” midfielder Taras Stepanenko told reporters before the game against Monchengladbach. “A lot of soldiers, a lot of people in Ukraine love football, and they [have] only one demand: ‘Please do everything you can to go to the World Cup.’
“For them, it’s like a moment of hope. It will be like a celebration for the country. That’s why we have to play. We have to play with our soul, with our heart. This is very, very important. It will be very emotional for my country, for our players and for all Ukraine.”

The team also will have to overcome long odds to win a spot in Qatar, beating Scotland on June 1 in Glasgow and, if it wins that, beating Wales four days later in Cardiff. But then the Ukrainians already have defied much longer odds by holding off, and in many places defeating, the Russian army for nearly three months.
“I don’t want anything … no house, no car,” coach Oleksandr Petrakov said. “But if I take the team to Qatar, I have lived my life for a reason.”
Petrakov is aware his team is being cheered by much of the world — including the U.S. national team, which would play Ukraine in its World Cup opener if Petrakov’s team prevails in its upcoming qualifiers.
“I think we’re all pulling for Ukraine,” American coach Gregg Berhalter said. “We’re all behind them, all supporting them.”
In the Monchengladbach game, which Ukraine won 2-1, Petrakov used a team composed entirely of players from the Ukrainian Premier League, which suspended its season at the start of the invasion. For the qualifiers, he is expected to call in reinforcements, including Manchester City’s Oleksandr Zinchenko, Benfica’s Roman Yaremchuk and West Ham’s Andriy Yarmolenko, the national team’s leading active scorer with 44 international goals.
Despite Saturday’s 2-0 loss at Colorado, LAFC (7-2-2) leads the MLS in points and goals and is just one point off the pace the team set through 11 games in 2019, when it broke the MLS record for points in a season en route to a Supporters’ Shield. It’s done so despite an offseason makeover in which it changed managers, lost two assistant coaches and added five new starters.
In fact, the only holdover in the technical area is assistant coach Ante Razov, and that leads to a question: Why is he not managing his own MLS club?
“It is a goal of mine,” he said of becoming a head coach. “[But] I’m very happy with where I am. Every day, I’m evolving and learning. It’s not going to change my life if it doesn’t come, but I’ll be ready for it if it does.”
Razov has spent most of his career in the presence of coaching giants. After graduating from Fontana High, he went on to play for Sigi Schmid at UCLA before joining the original Galaxy team in 1996. With the Galaxy, his teammates included Greg Vanney, Robin Fraser, Chris Armas, Cobi Jones and Curt Onalfo, all of whom went on to become MLS managers.
Razov played for Bob Bradley on three teams, including an MLS Cup champion in Chicago in 1998, and for Bruce Arena, the winningest coach in American history, on the national team. He won an MLS Cup in 2016 as an assistant to Brian Schmetzer in Seattle. But he had his greatest success, and learned the most, after being reunited with Bradley with LAFC.
“LAFC would not be as good in as good a place if it wasn’t for the structure that was built by Bob,” he said. “That is clear. I will argue that till the end of my time. I was fortunate to work with him, and the club is fortunate that he was there.”
But Bradley, the second-winningest active coach in MLS, has a losing record and a negative goal differential with Toronto, while LAFC, under first-year coach Steve Cherundolo, leads the league in wins (seven) and points (23), is tied for the lead in goals (23), is second in differential (plus-11) and is challenging the franchise records Bradley left behind.
And because Razov is the only remaining coaching link between Bradley’s LAFC staff and the one Cherundolo has rebuilt, it’s fair to ask just how much of that success is because of the assistant coach. (Consider too that Razov, who had an undisclosed illness, was not on the sideline Saturday in Colorado when LAFC lost for only the second time this season while being shut out for the first time since September.)
Eight teams have changed coaches since the end of last season, and none of them hired Razov.
“I’ve had a couple of discussions with some teams,” he said almost conspiratorially, glancing around the LAFC practice facility to see whether anyone was listening. “I’m not one that openly throws my name into the ring. You have to pick situations that work for you.
“I would not just take anything, because I have ideas.”
Ideas a lot like the ones he has helped Bradley and Cherundolo implement in the last five seasons.
“I’m a big proponent of the way LAFC plays,” Razov said. “I worked hand in hand with Bob on this. And it’s not me just liking what he did. It’s me actually believing in this way of playing.”
LAFC didn’t play that way Saturday, when it gave up two first-half goals on penalty kicks by Gyasi Zardes and Diego Rubio to spoil an otherwise sterling debut by goalkeeper John McCarthy, who made four saves.
The team had not conceded a penalty kick in a league-record 46 matches dating to November 2020.
LAFC took just 17 players to Colorado because of what the team said were injuries, then lost defender Ryan Hollingshead in the 40th minute. Captain Carlos Vela did not put a shot on target for the fifth game in a row and extended his scoreless streak to seven MLS games.
“We all watched a very poor football match today,” Cherundolo said. “It is our ambition to win every game, and to do that we need to play better.”
LAFC doesn’t have much time to fix that because it faces Austin, which is tied for the MLS lead in goals, on Wednesday night at Banc of California Stadium. The match will be the second of five games in a two-week span for the Black and Gold. Included in that schedule is the U.S. Open Cup game against the Galaxy on May 25 in Carson.

The Galaxy also had a forgettable weekend, stumbling through their worst performance of the season in a 3-1 loss to FC Dallas on Saturday night at Dignity Health Sports Park. And many in the sellout crowd of 25,147 voiced their disappointment by booing the team off the field afterward.
Dallas took advantage of defensive breakdowns to build a 3-0 lead in the first 23 minutes of a game the Galaxy never really were a part of. The three goals surrendered matched a season high for the Galaxy, who had conceded just three times in the previous six games combined.
The team’s only goal came from Douglas Costa in the 67th minute. The Galaxy (6-4-1) haven’t scored multiple times in a game in more than a month, and Javier “Chicharito” Hernández, the team’s leading scorer, is without a goal in his last five MLS games.
Only six teams in MLS have fewer goals than the Galaxy’s 12 on the season.
“We weren’t up to the speed of it right from the start,” Vanney, the Galaxy’s coach, said. “I felt like we were slow with the ball. We were passive sometimes. We weren’t transitioning fast enough.
“We gave up three goals in 12 minutes, a lot of which are our own mistakes. Then we’re spending roughly 70 minutes chasing the game.”
Saturday’s loss also was the start of a busy period for the Galaxy, who face Minnesota United on Wednesday in the second of five games in 15 days.
“I’m personally of the mind that every time I lose a game, I’m happy when there’s a game three days later because it’s a chance to make things right,” midfielder Sacha Kljestan said. “So yeah, I’m happy, we’re playing again.
“It’s one game at a time. We can’t look too far ahead. We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”
Speaking of MLS, a record 82 countries were represented on its 28 opening-day rosters, making it the most diverse first-division soccer league in the world. The number also marks a 37% increase from 2010, when MLS teams featured players born in 60 countries.
The U.S. is represented by 350 players, with another 46 coming from Canada, accounting for 50.1% of the roster spots. Argentina had the next most players with 40.
The Galaxy roster includes players from a dozen countries, including the U.S. and Canada, one more than LAFC.
Italy’s Serie A is the most diverse major European league, with players from 62 countries. France’s Ligue 1 is next with 60, followed by the English Premier League (59), Spain’s La Liga (54) and the German Bundesliga (52).
Forty-three of the U.S. states have players in MLS, led by California with 64. That’s more than double the 26 players from second-place New York. MLS also is one of the youngest leagues in the world with the players on its rosters averaging just more than 25 years of age.

Expansion teams are supposed to leave the starting gate slowly and feel their way through their first seasons. But that hasn’t been the case with the San Diego Wave and Angel City FC, who are first and second, respectively, in the NWSL standings three weeks into their first regular seasons.
San Diego remained unbeaten with a 2-1 win over the Chicago Red Stars on Sunday, the same day Angel City picked up the first road victory in franchise history with a 1-0 win over the defending league champion Washington Spirit.
Alex Morgan padded her league lead with her fifth goal of the season for San Diego (3-0-0), which gave up its only score of the season in the final minute of regulation. Three of Morgan’s goals have come on penalty kicks.
For Angel City (2-1-0), Christen Press’ first goal for her hometown team, which came in the 42nd minute, was the difference.
“It’s really important for us as an expansion team to have short-term memories when it comes to performances that we’re not happy with so we can continue to take points,” Press said of Angel City, which was coming off its first loss.
“We were feeling the effects of the loss last week and wanted to put that right and build momentum again,” coach Freya Coombe said. “It’s important for us. We’ve got to try to compete every game and everywhere we go.”
Angel City returns to Banc of California Stadium on Saturday to face the winless Kansas City Current.
Santa Ana native Christian Ramirez, who scored four goals in 17 games in parts of two seasons with LAFC, had 13 goals and four assists in all competitions for Aberdeen of the Scottish Premier League. … Milan IIoski had three of Orange County’s five first-half goals in a 5-1 win over FC Tulsa on Friday. It was the 10th time in USL Championship history that a team scored five times in one half, and it was the fourth hat trick in OCSC history. Orange County (3-3-3), the reigning league champion, is 10th in the 13-team Western Conference standings but has lost just one of its last five games.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-17/ukraine-mariupol-surrender-russia-attacks-east-west;2022-05-18;Ukraine gives up Mariupol as Russia attacks east and west - Los Angeles Times;"With full control of the beleaguered port city of Mariupol in hand, Russian forces kept up their assault Tuesday on eastern Ukraine, now the focus of a grinding conflict that bears the hallmarks of a grim war of attrition.
Images posted online depicted wounded Ukrainian servicemen taken on stretchers from the vast Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol to buses that evacuated them to a hospital in Russian-controlled territories. The sprawling plant was the soldiers’ last redoubt in the strategic city, whose capture gives Russia a badly needed victory and a bastion on the Sea of Azov.
Overnight, 264 Ukrainian defenders, including more than 50 who were seriously wounded, were evacuated from Azovstal under Russian military escort. More than 200 others were transported through a humanitarian corridor to Olenivka, a town controlled by pro-Russia separatists.
Much remains unclear about the evacuation deal, which appears to have been negotiated in secret under the auspices of the International Red Cross and the United Nations and was  announced Monday by the Russian Defense Ministry. On Tuesday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the severely wounded servicemen would be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war “after their condition stabilizes.”
“We are working on the next stages of the humanitarian operation,” she added.
Also unknown is how many fighters remain inside the Azovstal plant, with commanders now under orders from the army’s high command to save the lives of their personnel instead of pressing on with their defense. Ukraine’s military said in a statement early Tuesday that efforts were continuing to save the remaining fighters, lauding them as “heroes of our time” who would be mentioned “forever in history.”
As the buses rumbled out of Azovstal, Russian forces continued attacks on eastern Ukraine, with their main efforts focused “in the direction of Donetsk province,” according to an operational update from the Ukrainian army’s general staff on Tuesday. The update said Ukraine had repelled 11 enemy assaults in the last 24 hours, including around the city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost area still under Ukrainian government control and the site of intense combat in recent weeks.

In a tranquil Ukrainian monastery, dozens driven from homes by war find refuge. The nuns say they will offer shelter as long as it’s needed.

Russian cruise missiles also struck locations near the northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, according to reports from regional authorities.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it “sabatoge activity.”
“These strikes, like the many previous ones, do not fundamentally change anything,” he said in a video address. “This is kind of an attempt to compensate the Russian army for a series of failures in the east and south of our country.”
Ukrainian guerrilla fighters have also reportedly killed multiple high-ranking Russian officers in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, according to the regional administration, but the reports could not be independently confirmed.
In the west, a missile salvo — the second in three days — damaged what Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on his  social media channel was railway infrastructure near the town of Yavoriv, about 30 miles west of Lviv and a short distance from the Polish border. The town is home to a base used for NATO and U.S. military training of Ukrainian troops; more recently it hosted foreigners intending to join Ukraine’s defense before a Russian barrage there two months ago killed about 35 people.
“This was indeed one of the largest attacks on the Lviv region in terms of the number of missiles,” Sadovyi wrote. “It is difficult to predict what will happen next.”
There was no word on injuries or deaths. Ukrainian air defense intercepted three missiles, Lviv Gov. Maksym Kozytsky said on his official channel on the Telegram messaging service.

Ukraine has used postage stamps to boost wartime morale. One image stood out — and sold out. ‘Just felt what we all felt,’ young designer says.

The overnight aerial assault, which lighted up the night sky and shook the city center, had little effect on daily life in Lviv, where people have become accustomed to air-raid sirens and rocket attacks that typically target infrastructure.
“This has become normal for us,” said Vitalii Kos, who was a member of a work team Tuesday installing protective metal scaffolding around a monument in the Old City, part of an effort to shield monuments in the historic district. “This is part of our life now in Lviv.”
By contrast, most of Mariupol lies in ruins, its stately boulevards reduced to rubble by a relentless bombardment that has caused most residents to flee.
For weeks, Russian troops continued to strike the Azovstal plant, hoping to flush out the Ukrainian fighters bunkered in its network of  tunnels. Women, children and elderly people who had also sheltered there were bused out to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia  this month after a harrowing ordeal underground, with no sunlight and with fast-decreasing food and water supplies.
The evacuation of the fighters overnight Monday was described by Russia as a mass surrender; Ukraine said only that its troops there had completed their mission.
“It’s a relief, but it’s not the end,” Oleksandr Danylyuk, a Ukrainian army officer who once served as the country’s national security chief and finance minister, told the BBC on Tuesday.
World & Nation
Fighting rages in Ukraine, and Russia suffers losses along a strategic river. Top U.S. and Russian defense officials speak for the first time in nearly three months.

Russia’s tightened grip on Mariupol consolidates its position along the Sea of Azov and helps establish a land bridge to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014. The victory — Moscow’s first significant win in 83 days of fighting in Ukraine — should allow Russian military leaders to reorient forces stationed in Mariupol for combat operations in other disputed areas of Donetsk province or for a new push toward Zaporizhzhia, about 120 miles northwest of Mariupol.
Although Ukrainian troops were ordered at last to abandon Mariupol, they nevertheless bought time for their compatriots fighting on other fronts, occupying what the Ukrainian military said were up to 20,000 Russian personnel who would have been deployed elsewhere.
“We got the critically needed time to build reserves, regroup forces and receive assistance from partners,” the Ukrainian army’s general staff said in its statement.
Indeed, Moscow’s campaign in the east appears to have lost momentum, with its forces making costly but incremental advances even as Ukrainian units have begun their own counteroffensives meant to frustrate Russia’s advance around the Seversky Donets River. On Monday, Ukraine said its troops near the northeastern city of Kharkiv had pushed back invading forces to the border with Russia.

Russian bombs wrecked a small museum holding works by one of Ukraine’s best-known artists, Maria Prymachenko. But townspeople rescued a national legacy.

The claim could not be independently verified, but if true, it opens up a pathway for Ukrainian troops to harass Russian supply lines to  Izyum, about 70 miles southeast of Kharkiv.
Those and other setbacks appears to have spurred a reevaluation of the Ukraine invasion even from inside Russia. On Monday, in a rare break with Moscow’s official narrative, retired Russian colonel and defense columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a scathing assessment of the state of the war and dismissed claims of an impending collapse of Ukrainian forces’ morale.
“All of that, to put it mildly, is false,” he said on a talk show on Russian state TV, according to the BBC’s translation of the video broadcast.
Khodaryonok added that, with the U.S. and European Union poised to send tens of billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid, the prospect of “a million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality in the very near future.”
“The situation in this regard for us will frankly get worse,” Khodaryonok said, adding that Russia had become deeply isolated diplomatically and that, “however much we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us.”
That isolation increased Tuesday when Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde signed a formal application for her country to join  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a step that neighboring Finland also is taking. Less than three months of a war in Ukraine has persuaded both nations to scrap decades of official nonalignment.
“It feels very big, very serious, and it feels like we have arrived at a conclusion which is the best for Sweden,” Linde told reporters. “We don’t know how long it will take, but we calculate that it could take up to a year.”

Later on Tuesday, the Finnish Parliament overwhelmingly voted 188 to 8 to proceed with Helsinki’s NATO bid. At a  news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said the two countries would hand in their applications to the alliance Wednesday.
“Democracy has won,” Niinistö said. “This whole spring has been a triumph for democracy in Finland.”
Both leaders plan to meet with President Biden in Washington on Thursday to discuss “Finland’s and Sweden’s NATO membership, Russia’s warfare in Ukraine and the relationship of Europe and the United States in the changed security situation,” a statement from the Finnish Foreign Ministry said.

Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.

Despite the Kremlin’s earlier warning of serious repercussions if Sweden and Finland join the Western alliance, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday played down the move, noting that the two Nordic nations have “been participating in NATO military exercises for many years.”
“NATO takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the east,” Lavrov said. “So in this sense there is probably not much difference.”
Still, Russia said it was expelling two employees of the Finnish Embassy in Moscow, which followed Finnish authorities’ decision to expel a pair of diplomats from the Russian Embassy in Helsinki. The Kremlin accused Finland of steering a “confrontational course towards Russia” by supplying “weapons to the Kyiv regime and covering up the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against the civilian population” of the Donbas region — where Moscow recognizes two breakaway republics — and the rest of Ukraine.
Russia contends that Ukraine is controlled by neo-Nazis bent on persecuting ethnic Russians in various parts of the country.

Here in Lviv, the shifting tides of the war have changed the calculus of some Ukrainians. Lviv’s elegant 19th century railway station, which has been a way station for millions fleeing warfare, now hosts another group of travelers: evacuees returning to their homes after Russian forces have been pushed out of, or abandoned, areas such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Chernihiv.
“It’s very emotional to be going home,” said Alina Cheechkan, 35, as she, her mother and her 7-year old-daughter, Victoria, awaited a train back to Kharkiv. “One feels happy, but also nervous.”
Like so many others, the three had fled Kharkiv in February as the Russians attacked. She has heard from her husband, who stayed behind, that the family home is intact.
With the three was Koblan Lesia, 29, a Lviv lawyer who lent her home to the displaced family. Such acts of generosity have been commonplace here, as residents hastened to help the millions uprooted by conflict.
“We did our small part to help,” said Lesia as she bade goodbye to her three unexpected guests.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-23/world-food-program-chief-presses-billionaires;2022-05-23;World Food Program presses Musk, Bezos, other billionaires amid war in Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"The head of the U.N.’s World Food Program is telling billionaires it’s “time to step up” as the global threat of food insecurity rises with Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying he’s seen encouraging signs from some of the world’s richest people, like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
Agency Executive Director David Beasley built upon a social media back-and-forth he had with Musk last year, when the Tesla CEO challenged policy advocates to show how a $6 billion donation sought by the U.N. agency could solve world hunger.
Since then, “Musk put $6 billion into a foundation. But everybody thought it came to us, but we ain’t gotten any of it yet. So I’m hopeful,” Beasley told the Associated Press at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where some of the world’s biggest elites and billionaires have gathered.
“I don’t know what it’s going to take,” he said of Musk. “We’re trying every angle, you know: Elon, we need your help, brother.”
Musk and Bezos didn’t immediately respond to emails or other messages seeking comment.
Beasley’s challenge came as a new study projected that nearly 1.9 billion people could face food insecurity by November. Eurasia Group and DevryBV Sustainable Strategies presented the report at the Global Citizen NOW Summit in New York Monday, saying that as many as 243 million people could fall into food insecurity due to what U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called “hurricane of hunger” heightened by the war in Ukraine.
“The projections are bleak right now,” Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans told the AP. “This doesn’t have to happen. A lot of institutions are failing people.”
World & Nation
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls for maximum sanctions against Russia in a virtual speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.



Evans said he hopes that launching the Global Citizen Impact Fund, which will only require payment on pledges based on results, will convince ultra high-net worth individuals to donate more since they will already have proof of the effectiveness of their gifts. In the short-term, though, Erna Solberg, former prime minister of Norway and a Global Citizen board member, said at the summit that “agenda item  No. 1” is to get the grain already harvested in Ukraine out of the country through its ports.
Musk, the world’s richest man, donated about 5 million shares of Tesla stock worth roughly $5.7 billion at the time to an unidentified charity in November, according to a regulatory filing.
It came after Musk tweeted in late October that he would sell $6 billion in Tesla stock and give the money to the World Food Program if the organization would describe how the money would solve world hunger. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing did not name any recipients for Musk’s donation.
Beasley told the AP on Monday that his message wasn’t just to those two high-profile tech mavens, but other billionaires, too.
“The world is in real serious trouble. This is not rhetoric and B.S. Step up now, because the world needs you,” he said.

Will gas and food prices continue to rise? How might the conflict in Eastern Europe affect Silicon Valley and Hollywood?


Ukraine and Russia together export a third of the world’s wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil, while Russia is a top supplier of fertilizer that has surged in price. The Kremlin’s forces are accused of blocking Ukrainian ports, and the interruption of those affordable food staples is threatening food shortages and political unrest in countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
The threat to the global food supply has been a pressing concern for officials, with Guterres saying last week that he was in “intense contacts” with Russia and other key countries and is “hopeful” of an agreement to allow the export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports and ensure Russian food and fertilizer have unrestricted access to global markets.
If Ukraine’s supplies remain off the market, the world could face a food availability problem in the next 10 to 12 months, and “that is going to be hell on Earth,” Beasley said."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-23/russian-sentenced-life-ukraine-war-crimes-trial;2022-05-23;Russian sentenced to life in Ukraine's 1st war-crimes trial - Los Angeles Times;"A captured Russian soldier who pleaded guilty to killing a civilian was sentenced by a Ukrainian court Monday to life in prison — the maximum — amid signs the Kremlin may, in turn, put on trial some of the fighters who surrendered at Mariupol’s steelworks.
Meanwhile, in a rare public expression of opposition to the war from the ranks of the Russian elite, a veteran Kremlin diplomat resigned and sent a scathing letter to foreign colleagues in which he said of the invasion, “Never have I been so ashamed of my country as on Feb. 24.”
Also, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for “maximum” sanctions against Russia in a video address to world leaders and executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
On the battlefield, heavy fighting raged in the Donbas in the east, where Moscow’s forces have stepped up their bombardment. Cities not under Russian control were constantly shelled, and one Ukrainian official said Russian forces targeted civilians trying to flee.
In the first of what could be a multitude of war crimes trials held by Ukraine, Russian Sgt.  Vadim Shyshimarin, 21, was sentenced for the killing of a 62-year-old man who was shot in the head in a village in the northeastern Sumy region in the opening days of the war.
Shyshimarin, a member of a tank unit, had claimed he was following orders, and he apologized to the man’s widow in court.




World & Nation
A Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since the start of the Ukraine war says he fatally shot a civilian on orders from two officers.

Shyshimarin’s Ukraine-appointed defense attorney, Victor Ovsyanikov, argued that his client had been unprepared for the “violent military confrontation” and mass casualties that Russian troops encountered when they invaded Ukraine. He said he would appeal.



Ukrainian civil liberties advocate Volodymyr Yavorskyy said it was “an extremely harsh sentence for one murder during the war.” But Aarif Abraham, a British-based human rights lawyer, said the trial was conducted “with what appears to be full and fair due process,” including access to an attorney.

Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating thousands of potential war crimes. Russian forces bombed a theater where civilians were sheltering and struck a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol. In the wake of Moscow’s withdrawal from towns around Kyiv weeks ago, mass graves were discovered and streets were strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha.

Before Shyshimarin‘s sentencing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was unable to defend the soldier but will consider trying to do so “through other channels.”
Mary Ellen O’Connell, an expert on international law at the University of Notre Dame, said that putting Shyshimarin  on trial could prove “extremely detrimental to Ukrainian soldiers in the hands of Russia.” She said Russia may decide to hold “show trials” of Ukrainians to boost the morale of its own soldiers and spread disinformation.
World & Nation
It’s been almost two months since Russian forces retreated from the outskirts of Kyiv, ending plans for a quick takeover, but devastation lingers.


“Maybe it would have happened without the Ukrainians beginning trials,” O’Connell said. “But the timing suggests that the Ukrainians should have held back and perhaps still should, so that the Russians can’t say, ‘We’re just doing to their soldiers what they did to ours.’”
Russian authorities have threatened to hold trials of captured Ukrainians — namely, fighters who held out at Mariupol’s shattered steel plant, the last stronghold of resistance in the strategic  port city. They surrendered and were taken prisoner last week, at which point Moscow claimed the capture of Mariupol was complete.
Russia’s main investigative body said it intends to interrogate the Mariupol defenders to “identify the nationalists” and determine whether they were involved in crimes against civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls for maximum sanctions against Russia in a virtual speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Russian authorities have seized upon the far-right origins of one of the regiments there, calling the Azov regiment’s fighters “Nazis” and accusing their commander without evidence of “numerous atrocities.” Russia’s top prosecutor has asked the country’s Supreme Court to designate the Azov regiment a terrorist organization.
Family members of the fighters have pleaded for their eventual return to Ukraine as part of a prisoner swap.



Elsewhere, Boris Bondarev, a veteran Russian diplomat at the U.N. office at Geneva, quit and sent a letter denouncing the “aggressive war unleashed” by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bondarev told the Associated Press: “It is intolerable what my government is doing now.”
In his letter, Bondarev said those who conceived the war “want only one thing — to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity.”
He also said Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is all about “warmongering, lies and hatred.”

At the Davos forum, Zelensky said sanctions against the Kremlin must go further. He urged an embargo on Russian oil, a complete cutoff of trade and a withdrawal of foreign companies from the country.
“This is what sanctions should be: They should be maximum, so that Russia and every other potential aggressor that wants to wage a brutal war against its neighbor would clearly know the immediate consequences of their actions,” said Zelensky, who received a standing ovation.
In other developments, nearly 50 defense leaders from around the world met Monday and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including missiles to protect its coast, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III told reporters in Washington.
On the battlefield, Russian forces increased their bombardment of the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories that Russia is bent on capturing.
Donetsk’s regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said three civilians died in Russian attacks there Monday and heavy fighting continued near the Luhansk region. The Donbas consists of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

He said the Russians were decimating cities in their attempt to take them over. Only about 320,000 people out of the region’s prewar population of 1.6 million remain, and Russian forces are targeting evacuation efforts, he said.
“They are killing us. They are killing the locals during evacuation,” Kyrylenko said.
On the eve of the three-month anniversary of the start of the war, Zelensky said four missiles killed 87 people last week in the town of Desna, 35 miles north of Kyiv.
The Russians have now concentrated their forces on Donbas cities and “are trying to destroy all life,” Zelensky said in his evening address to the nation.
In the Luhansk region, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, local authorities reported that a bridge leading to the administrative center of  Severodonetsk was destroyed, leaving the partially encircled city reachable by just one road.
Some who fled the Donetsk region shared their suffering.
“We haven’t been able to see the sun for three months. We are almost blind because we were in darkness for three months,” said Rayisa Rybalko, who hid with her family in their basement and then in a bomb shelter at a local school before fleeing their village of Novomykhailivka. “The world should have seen that.”
Her son-in-law Dmytro Khaliapin said heavy artillery pounded the village. “Houses are being ruined,” he said. “It’s a horror.”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-17/gop-splinters-ukraine-aid-trump-isolationism;2022-05-17;With echoes of Trump, GOP splinters over aid to Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Signs of Republican resistance are mounting over a $40-billion aid package to Ukraine, in a re-emergence of the Trump-led isolationist wing of the GOP at a crucial moment in Russia’s ongoing assault on its neighbor.
The Senate voted late Monday to advance the Ukraine aid bill 81-11, pushing it toward President Biden’s desk by week’s end to become law. But vocal objections from some Republicans are sending warning signs after what has been rare and united support for Ukraine as it desperately battles Russia. All 11 no votes in the Senate came from GOP members.
The dissent comes after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) led a delegation of GOP senators to Ukraine over the weekend in a show of support, vowing to push past detractors, finish up the aid package and vote this summer on expanding NATO to welcome Sweden and Finland. McConnell finds himself holding down the GOP’s more traditional foreign policy approach, in direct confrontation with the GOP’s “America First” flank, including former President Trump.
“There’s always been isolationist voices in the Republican Party,” McConnell told reporters on a conference call over the weekend from Stockholm. “It won’t create a problem — we’ll get the job done.”
The shift in Congress opens a new political phase in Ukraine’s fight for its survival against the Russian invasion, offering a wake-up call for the Biden administration about its strategy as it resists direct U.S. military troop involvement and depends on votes in the House and Senate to fund the military and humanitarian relief effort.
While a strong bipartisan majority is poised to approve the latest round of Ukraine aid, bringing the U.S. total to $53 billion since the start of Russia’s invasion Feb. 24, it’s clear that Republicans, and some Democrats, are wary of prolonged intervention. While the House overwhelmingly approved the $40-billion package last week, 57 Republicans voted against it.

Moscow is scrambling to adjust to a new security picture in Europe brought about by its invasion of Ukraine, where fighting is ravaging the east.

The most vocal lawmakers are insisting that Congress will not become a blank check for overseas action amid domestic needs as they move away from supporting the U.S.’ longstanding role of championing democracy abroad.

“We have got to take care of things here at home first,” Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the former Trump administration’s ambassador to Japan, said on Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”
Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who voted against the aid package, tweeted: “That’s not isolationism. That’s nationalism.”
It’s stronger pushback than just a few months ago, at the start of the war, when Congress made a rare show of bipartisan unity against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion and rushed to Ukraine’s aid.

Ukraine has used postage stamps to boost wartime morale. One image stood out — and sold out. ‘Just felt what we all felt,’ young designer says.

And it comes as the midterm election season is underway in the U.S., with Trump’s influence looming large, particularly with Republican lawmakers desperate for his endorsement and afraid to go against him.
“We have a moral obligation to pass this aid as soon as we can,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday ahead of the procedural vote.
Trump weighed in, breaking the civic norm in the U.S. that former presidents traditionally step aside to allow one president at a time to lead, particularly on foreign policy.
The former president, whose “America First” strategy sought to pull back from U.S. commitments around the world and criticized the NATO military alliance confronting Russia, complained that Democrats are “sending another $40 billion to Ukraine, yet America’s parents are struggling to even feed their children.”
Opinion
Republicans are unified in attacking the way Biden withdrew from Afghanistan. But that hides a deep split on foreign policy between conservative voters and GOP pundits.


Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 after he withheld military aid to Ukraine and pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky for a favor in digging up dirt on Biden ahead of the U.S. presidential election. He was later acquitted by the Senate.
On the campaign trail in Ohio, the U.S. Senate candidates, Democrat Tim Ryan and Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance, have been brawling over the Ukraine assistance.
Vance, who quipped some months ago that he doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, tweeted last week that Ryan “is pushing billions in foreign aid while the communities he serves in Congress have been decimated.”
Ryan’s team released an ad suggesting that Vance as a venture capitalist had profited off a social media platform that is used to spread Russian propaganda.
The first round of Ukraine aid, $13.9 billion, was swiftly approved by Congress in March as part of a broader bill to fund the government. It came just before Zelensky delivered a video address at a joint meeting of Congress to several standing ovations.
But as the war drags on, U.S. lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have become more assertive in their resistance, posing questions for U.S. strategy ahead.
Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky single-handedly blocked a vote on the latest aid package last week when he demanded an inspector general’s report on how the money is being spent. The libertarian-leaning Paul routinely blocks spending bills with a filibuster, but he is also a non-interventionist when it comes to foreign policy who had great sway during the Trump era, encouraging the then-president’s instincts against engaging in overseas actions.
“While I sympathize with the people of Ukraine, and commend their fight against Putin, we cannot continue to spend money we don’t have,” Paul said in a series of tweets about his holdup of the vote.
Outside groups influential with Republicans, including Heritage Action, have raised questions about the Ukraine spending. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on his show last week that he was calling every senator’s office to see where he or she stood on the issue."

In a video address, Zelensky said the grinding military panorama in the heavily contested eastern Donbas region “is extremely difficult,”  noting that Russian forces continue to mass around  the cities of Severodonetsk and Slovyansk, strategic points that serve as the base for the Ukrainian defense of the Donbas.

He described a war of attrition, with his military’s strategy to try to  wear down and frustrate Russian forces as they continue to pound Ukrainian positions.
The president said the military situation “had not changed significantly,” which he called a positive development, considering Moscow’s vast military capabilities.
“Actually, the fact that we are able to say this on the 87th day of a full-scale war against Russia is good news,” Zelensky said. “Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us.”
World & Nation
The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have been devastating for families, including those who have seen their prospective adoptions put on hold.
Zelensky thanked Biden, who on Saturday signed one of the biggest foreign assistance packages in recent U.S. history. But Zelensky said additional weaponry would be required to open transport routes and ports that have been blocked by the Russians, actions that have fueled grain shortages and inflation globally.

His call for further aid highlights  the unremitting nature of a conflict that began Feb. 24, when Russian troops invaded Ukrainian territory on various fronts. The Russian expectation of a quick victory evaporated as Ukrainian forces put up stiff resistance, forcing Moscow to abandon its plan to seize the capital, Kyiv.
Russian forces eventually retreated from Kyiv in early April and redirected efforts toward southern Ukraine and the Donbas, Ukraine’s coal-producing, traditional industrial heartland. The Donbas is composed of the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Since 2014, pro-Russia separatists have controlled large swaths of the Donbas region. Moscow’s forces are seeking to expand control to the entire Donbas.
On Sunday, Polish President Andrzej Duda appeared before Ukraine’s parliament in Kyiv and criticized recent remarks by some European leaders that Ukraine should consider a peace deal that would require it to cede some parts of the Donbas region to Russia.
Duda, who thanked Ukraine for leading the fight against “Russian imperialism,” said it would be a “huge blow not only for Ukraine, but also for the entire Western world,” if even a sliver of the country was lost in a deal.
Neighboring Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, sending weapons, housing millions of refugees who have fled the fighting and promoting Ukraine’s efforts to join the European Union.
As Duda spoke in the capital, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops “continue to advance in the east” while the forces of Belarus — a close Russian ally just north of  Ukraine — “are conducting intensified reconnaissance on the border with Ukraine.”
Ukrainian forces repelled nine enemy attacks during the previous 24 hours in the Donbas, the military reported.
A day earlier, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said that Russian troops were throwing “all their forces and efforts” into assaulting Severodonetsk. The aim was to cut off the main supply route to the key city, he said.
World & Nation
A Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since the start of the Ukraine war says he fatally shot a civilian on orders from two officers.

“The Russians are destroying Severodonetsk ... The enemy’s plans are to surround the area or turn it into a fire,” Haidai said in a statement on Telegram.
A Russian breakthrough in Luhansk would enable an attack on nearby Donetsk and Kharkiv provinces, he added.
Haidai said the Russians had destroyed a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, its twin city across the Seversky Donets River. The bridge’s destruction will complicate efforts to bring reinforcements to Severodonetsk, he said.
Russia is continuing to press its offensive in the east after claiming its biggest victory in its almost-three-month assault: the full capture of the sprawling Azovstal steelworks plant in the coastal city of Mariupol. The facility’s labyrinthine network of pipes and tunnels became the site of Ukraine’s last stand in Mariupol.
The battle for Mariupol came to dramatize the violence and intensity of the Ukrainian conflict. Much of Mariupol is in ruins and Ukrainian authorities say only about 100,000 of a pre-war population of more than 400,000 remain.
Russia said it captured 2,439 Ukrainian troops when it took the metal-works plants. The fate of the captured fighters is unclear.
Although Kyiv said it would bring back its troops via prisoner exchanges, the Kremlin has yet to comment on their fate. In recent days, Russian lawmakers have called for prison terms and even capital punishment for members of the Azov regiment, a far-right Ukrainian military unit with neo-Nazi roots whose fighters emerged as the Azovstal plant’s most stubborn defenders. The history of the group has been seized on by the Kremlin to claim it is fighting “Nazis” in Ukraine, an assertion dismissed as ridiculous by the Ukrainian government.
World & Nation
As Russia fines and arrests citizens for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, people are turning to coded messages.
Mariupol has been a target of Russia’s invasion virtually from the start of the war. As much of the city fell into Russian hands, an assortment of Ukrainian troops and civilians bunkered in the massive plant even as their adversaries maintained a relentless siege, along with continuous bombardment. Women, children and elderly people were first bused out before Ukrainian authorities ordered the remaining troops to surrender. The full death toll of civilians in the Mariupol siege is still unknown, but Ukraine says it could be many thousands.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that tracks conflicts, said in a new report that Russian forces were working to remove mines from around the plant and predicted that “the information space in Mariupol will likely become increasingly restricted in the coming weeks as Russian forces shift their attention from the capture of Azovstal to consolidating occupational control over the city.”
For Russia, the capture of Mariupol offers the prospect of a land bridge between pro-Russia territory in the Donbas and the Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. Its control of Mariupol is a major victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin. But Russia seems intent on pushing for further territorial gains in the Donbas, signaling a prolonged land battle involving tanks, artillery, aircraft and ground forces in the broad eastern stretches of Ukraine.

Ukraine was once one of the United States’ most frequent partners on international adoptions, but the war changed all that: The embattled country has halted all international adoptions as it copes with the turmoil unleashed on its courts and social services. Many children, including orphans, have also fled or been displaced.
When the war started, there were more than 300 Ukrainian children previously hosted by American families that were seeking to formally adopt them, said Ryan Hanlon, chief executive officer and president of the National Council for Adoption. Representatives for adoption agencies said that means at least 200 families were engaged in the adoption process, which takes two to three years in ideal circumstances.
But the National Council for Adoption made clear in a statement that “this is not the appropriate time or context to be considering adoption by U.S. citizens.”
That is because adoptions can proceed only with children who are clearly orphaned or for whom parental rights have been terminated, the group said, and establishing identities and family statuses is impossible for many Ukrainian children right now.


World & Nation
Russian troops continued their offensive into the Donbas region on Saturday, aiming to encircle the easternmost point of Ukrainian control.

Jessica Pflumm, a stay-at-home mom who runs a smoothie business and has two daughters in the suburbs of Kansas City, is one prospective adoptive parent. She hopes to adopt Maks, a younger teen — Pflumm was reluctant to reveal his exact age because of safety concerns — whom they hosted for four weeks in December and January. Maks is now back in Ukraine, where his orphanage’s director has moved him to relative safety in the country’s west.
“Every day is hard. We pray a lot and we try to think of what he is experiencing versus what we’re experiencing,” Pflumm said. “For us, it’s hard, but nothing compared to what he’s experiencing.”

War, natural disasters and other destabilizing events have a long history of upending intercountry adoptions. And Ukraine is a big piece of the international adoption puzzle, Hanlon said.
International adoptions have declined in number in recent years, but they have stayed relatively common from Ukraine. In fiscal year 2020, it surpassed China to become the country with the most adoptions to the U.S., responsible for more than 10% of all intercountry adoptions to the U.S., Hanlon said. Ukraine has one of the highest rates of children living in orphanages in Europe.
There were more than 200 adoptions from Ukraine in 2020 and nearly 300 in 2019, according to statistics from the U.S. State Department. Russia, meanwhile, banned adoptions of children by American families in 2013 (about 60,000 children from Russia had been adopted by Americans in the two preceding decades).
Many prospective adoptions begin with U.S. families temporarily hosting older Ukrainian children through a network of orphan-hosting programs, Hanlon said.
“It’s a very different experience if you’ve already connected with a particular child,” Hanlon said. “There’s a very visceral connection that these families have with their children, with having them in their homes.”
Pflumm said she and her family do have a language barrier with Maks. He speaks only Russian, which they do not know. She said they communicate with him via phone, typing everything into Google Translate. A friend from Belarus sometimes interprets, she said.
Pflumm said the family truly bonded with Maks through experiences, above language. When he was in Kansas, he experienced his first Christmas opening gifts, she said. They also connected over sports, and Maks was introduced to baseball, Pflumm said.
These days, Maks hears air raids going on every night and is often unable to sleep, Pflumm said.
“He deserves to have a family, and to have opportunity in front of him,” she said. “I feel like these kids are lost in the shuffle.”
In rural Maine, Tracy Blake-Bell and her family hosted two brothers, now 14 and 17, for a month in 2020 through a Wyoming-based program called Host Orphans Worldwide. The family then began the formal adoption process — an already complex process further snarled first by the pandemic and now war.
The brothers, who grew up in orphanages, are now in a Polish facility, the Blake-Bells said. But the Blake-Bells, who have two teenage sons and a dog named Jack, want them home.
“My husband and I love these two children as much as we love anyone in the world,” Tracy Blake-Bell said.
For most families, the wait is not going to end soon.
The State Department “is working with the Ukrainian government on resolving cases involving families who have final adoption orders but need to obtain other required documents for the child’s immigrant visa processing,” spokesperson Vanessa Smith said.
However, the Ukrainian government maintains, per a March statement, that “under current conditions intercountry adoption is impossible.”
The Blake-Bells are among about 15 families waiting on that final step of the process — clearance from a Ukrainian court. And they said they’re going to stick with it, as long as it takes.
“These boys are eligible,” said Nat, Tracy Blake-Bell’s husband. “Let them experience something a little bit more than an orphanage.”"

Meanwhile, Moscow cut off natural gas exports to Finland, and the Russian Defense Ministry said it destroyed a consignment of U.S.- and European-supplied weapons meant for Ukrainian fighters in the Donbas.
Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Saturday that Russian troops were throwing “all their forces and efforts” into assaulting Severodonetsk in Luhansk province, aiming to cut off the main supply route to the city. Six people were killed and three others wounded in Russian attacks on Severodonetsk, Haidai said, along with at least two others killed in shelling on neighboring towns.
“The Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol. The enemy’s plans are to surround the area or turn it into a fire,” Haidai said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday, adding that Ukrainian forces had defended the city against 11 enemy incursions.
A Russian breakthrough in Luhansk would enable an attack on Donetsk and Kharkiv provinces, he added.
“This is the difficult fate of Luhansk region, not to allow the Russians to move forward,” he said. Later Saturday, Haidai said the Russians had destroyed a bridge between Severodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Seversky Donets River, which will make reinforcing the area more difficult.

A Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since the start of the Ukraine war says he fatally shot a civilian on orders from two officers.
The grinding advance in the east comes one day after Russia claimed its biggest victory in its almost-three-month assault: the full capture of the Azovstal steelworks plant, the labyrinthine underground network of tunnels that became Ukraine’s last stand in the coastal Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, along with the surrender of what the Russian Defense Ministry said were 2,439 Ukrainian fighters.

Although Kyiv said it would bring back its troops via prisoner exchanges, the Kremlin has yet to comment on their fate. In recent days, Russian lawmakers in the Duma called for prison terms and even capital punishment for members of the Azov regiment, a far-right Ukrainian military unit with neo-Nazi roots whose fighters emerged as the Azovstal plant’s most stubborn defenders. The history of the group has been seized on by the Kremlin to falsely claim it is fighting “Nazis” in Ukraine.
Mariupol has been a target of Russia’s invasion virtually from the start of the war. As the rest of the city fell into Russian hands, a ragtag assortment of Ukrainian troops and civilians bunkered in the steelworks even as their adversaries maintained a relentless siege — not to mention continuous bombardment — on the plant. Women, children and elderly people were first bused out before Ukrainian authorities ordered the remaining troops to surrender. The full death toll of civilians in the Mariupol siege is still unknown, but Ukraine says it could be many thousands.
Earlier, Denis Pushilin, self-proclaimed leader of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, said the Azovstal plant would be demolished and replaced with a park, a residence or what he called a techno park.
At a cemetery in Bucha — the suburb of Kyiv now infamous for alleged Russian war crimes — families took time on Saturday to visit the graves of relatives and friends lost in the war. Many mourners at the cemetery described what they viewed as the heroism of the Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol, who held off a superior Russian force for weeks.
“They are our heroes, they fought to the end,” said Anton Adoniev, 26, who visited the grave of a soldier from Bucha who recently was killed in the Donbas. “We all have faith that Ukraine will triumph in the end.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in remarks released Saturday, again insisted his country will ultimately prevail in the grueling conflict but that it will be a “bloody” victory.
“I do not believe that we were badly prepared for the war,” he said. “We should look at the price of this war. We are going to reclaim everything in any case. We have broken the backbone of one of the strongest armies in the world.”
But, he acknowledged: “The war is so complicated and so will be the victory. It will be bloody, through fighting, but the end will definitely be via diplomacy.”
At the same time, he said prospects for talks with Russia right now were dim.
Zelensky made the taped comments in a rare joint appearance with his wife, Olena Zelenska, whose only other public appearance in the war so far was with Jill Biden in a surprise stop by the U.S. first lady in western Ukraine on Mother’s Day.
Meanwhile, Russian state gas company Gazprom confirmed on Saturday a complete halt in gas supplies as of 7 a.m. Moscow time to Gasum, Finland’s state-owned natural gas wholesaler, after Helsinki refused to pay in rubles.
World & Nation
Russia scores its first major win with the takeover of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But will it change the course of the war?
“Payments for gas supplied from April 1 must be made in rubles … which the counterparties were informed of in a timely manner,” Gazprom said, according to a report from Russian state news operator Tass.
The cutoff comes days after Finland and Sweden reversed a decades-old policy of neutrality and sought to join NATO.
“It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted,” Gasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.
“However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months.”
The NATO applications of Finland and Sweden have received enthusiastic support from the United States and most members of the transatlantic alliance — with the notable exception of Turkey. Ankara’s opposition threatens to block the membership of the Nordic countries. Turkey accuses the nations of lending support to Kurdish separatists whom it regards as terrorists.
The leaders of Finland and Sweden held separate telephone conversations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday in attempts to assure him they will be respectful of Ankara’s security concerns.
“Close dialogue continues,” Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said afterward on Twitter.
In another sign of the war’s increasing fallout beyond Ukraine’s borders, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the small country of Moldova southwest of Ukraine should be equipped “to NATO standard” militarily so as to repulse any Russian aggression.
Speaking to the Telegraph newspaper  Saturday, Truss said Ukraine should be “permanently able to defend itself” along with “vulnerable states” such as Moldova.
“I would want to see Moldova equipped to NATO standard,” she said. “This is a discussion we’re having with our allies.”
World & Nation
As Russia fines and arrests citizens for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, people are turning to coded messages.
She added that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia,” which would presumably include parts of Moldova, which like Ukraine is a former Soviet republic.
“And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren’t successful doesn’t mean he’s abandoned those ambitions.”
Elsewhere, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said his forces destroyed an arms shipment sent by the U.S. and Europe to Ukraine’s military in northern Ukraine’s Zhytomyr region.
“High-precision, long-range, sea-based Kalibr missiles in the area of the Malyn railway station in the Zhytomyr region destroyed a large batch of weapons and military equipment delivered from the United States and European countries,” Konashenkov said in a statement Saturday.
Malyn is about 60 miles northwest of Kyiv. Konashenkov said the weapons and materiel were to go to Ukrainian troops in the Donbas.
The Pentagon says Russian forces have repeatedly attempted to intercept shipments from the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, which generally enter Ukraine over land from its western flank. Until now, the Pentagon has said the Russian attempts were unsuccessful. There was no immediate comment from Washington on Saturday’s claim by Russia.
Also Saturday, President Biden, traveling in Asia, signed into law a new $40-billion package of military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine — the largest yet — after it was approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress earlier last week.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-06/train-from-dnipro-to-lviv-ukraine;2022-05-06;22 hours to safety: Fleeing Ukraine’s embattled east by train - Los Angeles Times;"As the departure time neared, the last arriving passengers raced to catch the 2:30 p.m. train out of Dnipro. Their goal was to reach Lviv to the west and, they hoped, safety. The journey would take 22 hours.
A man dressed in military fatigues and carrying a backpack and bedroll struggled to find the electronic ticket on his phone. Three train attendants dressed in freshly pressed uniforms patiently tried to help.
Francis Dion, a 32-year-old soldier from Montreal who volunteered to fight for Ukraine, was headed to Lviv for lighter duty.
Across the platform, a dog was running loose on the train tracks, his leash trailing behind him. Elmira Andriiko of Dnipro was leaving home with two dogs, Archie and Lika. Once Archie was retrieved, they boarded the train and settled into the economy class.
Andriiko planned to stay in Germany until the war is over and hoped to find work there as a dog groomer, her profession. Archie, a 7-year-old mini-Yorkshire terrier, was freshly trimmed for the long trip ahead.
As the train pulled out of the station, screeching wheels drowned out the sound of a cat meowing unhappily. Tatiana Zaparoshytz, who has worked as a train attendant for two years, was taking care of the cat that was on its way to rejoin its owner in Lviv. It quieted down once the locomotive was in motion.
Many passengers, it seemed, also quieted down once the train finally set off. They were anxious but relieved as they recounted what they had seen since the Russians invaded and what they left behind.
Two cars over, Marina Bogdanova and her children, Fedor, 7, and Margo, 11, were settling in for the long trip. Bogdanova left home without her husband because men have to stay to fight. Margo and Fedor were in one bunk playing with the dolls the former had brought along.
“We got a sponsor family in the U.K. so we are going to Lviv,” Bogdanova said. From there, they hope to make their way to England.
“My children weren’t safe in Dnipro,” she said. “It’s stressful. The schools aren’t in session; some are being used as shelters. I hope my children will be able to study in England.”
Within an hour, Fedor and Margo had made friends with other children on board — also headed to the U.K. with their mother — and were playing in the narrow hallway.
Out the window were scenes at odds with a nation at war. Tractors plowed the fields. Horses grazed on grass and a deer trotted off at the sound of the approaching train. White-blossomed trees streaked by, brightening up the otherwise dreary day. Men stood by the windows, talking on cellphones and smoking.
Archie, the 8-pound terrier, was off his leash, visiting other passengers in his train car, cheering them up, including the Salosalova family from the besieged port city of Mariupol.
Katia Salosalova, 38, a teacher, and her husband, Sergie, 35, a steelworker, escaped Mariupol on April 21 with their little boy. They were continuing their way to the west of Ukraine. In Mariupol, “there’s no water, no gas, no food, no nothing,” she said. “You can’t live there. We left very quickly, during a green corridor. We hope to go back.”
Also from a front-line town were two 27-year-olds, Yaroslav Boriskin and his girlfriend, Diana (who didn’t want her last name used). They passed the time on her computer. Life in Kharkiv, a city in Ukraine’s northeast, had become unbearable, so they had fled with their black cat, Asya.
“We had to leave our apartment because it was damaged by shelling at the beginning of the war,” said Boriskin, an information technology specialist by trade. “The windows were blown out and there was no heat, so the water pipes burst.” Firemen had to break into the apartment, which was accessible only from the roof.
“We’ve been living at a friend’s place but found an apartment in Lviv,” Boriskin said. “Kharkiv isn’t in the best condition, thanks to our neighbors,” he said, in a sarcastic reference to the Russian invaders.
Diana is originally from Mariupol. She said the apartment where she grew up was heavily damaged by fire and a building nearby was destroyed. She saw it on the news.
Her parents, rather than head west, went east and are living with her uncle in Russia now, but they may be able to go to the European Union at some point. Boriskin’s parents are in Russian-controlled territory near Kherson, in southern Ukraine.  Asked how long he and Diana planned to stay in Lviv, he said: “Maybe a couple of months, maybe a year, maybe forever. Who knows?”
Dion, the foreign fighter, was catching up on rest on a narrow cot in coach. He had gotten out of the Canadian military just before Christmas, after serving 12 years.
When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “called for foreign fighters to join on Feb. 28th at 8 a.m., I was on a plane that night at 6 p.m.,” he said. “It was crazy to me that the entire world turned their back on Ukraine. They said, ‘Sorry, it’s too bad you aren’t part of NATO. You’re on your own. Russia is the second world power.’ I couldn’t just watch what was happening,” he said.
“I didn’t tell my parents,” he added. “Not until I got to Ukraine. They were devastated. They begged me to come home. I saw more action in six weeks on the front than I did in 12 years in the Canadian military.”
Nicknamed Shadow by his comrades, he took part in the battle in Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, the capital, which he described as urban warfare. When the Russians retreated, he was sent to the eastern front, where the fighting was far different. He could see the Russians through binoculars.
“It’s not the same war,” he said. “It’s impossible. It’s a field battle, trenches, and artillery, constant artillery. It never stops.”
There was another Canadian fighting in the same unit, a sniper, named Waly. Just a couple of days ago, the two of them were on a mission with two Ukrainian soldiers when Russians fired on their position. Waly and Francis survived, but the two Ukrainians, who were outside the trench, were killed instantly.
“The Ukrainians are very courageous,” Dion said. “Very professional. But it’s harder now. It’s very dangerous. It’s crazy.”
He planned to stay in Ukraine for a while longer but wants to go home before September, when his girlfriend is expecting a baby. He has no regrets. “I did my part,” he said. “I wouldn’t change anything. I couldn’t stay home.”
As the evening drew near, the sun broke through the clouds and lighted up the gold-leafed Orthodox churches that dot the landscape. Women were in their gardens pruning, people riding their bicycles home from town with groceries. People waved as the train passed by. The rumble of the locomotive was a welcome change from the sound of sirens back in Dnipro.
There is no meal service on the 20-hour overnight train to Lviv. But an attendant brought me a packaged sandwich, the kind you see at 7-Eleven, triangular in shape. Next to the attendant’s compartment is a hot water boiler available for use by those who brought their own coffee or tea. The train is old, but well maintained, with fresh sheets and a cotton towel provided in first class. It’s not a bullet train, but it moves along steadily, swaying side to side. (The newer trains were taken out of service because of the war.)
Curfew in Dnipro is 10 p.m., but on the train, there isn’t much to do once the sun goes down. Black plastic hangs on the windows to prevent light from escaping at night and giving away the train’s position to the enemy. After the bombing of the train station at Kramatorsk, everyone lowered the shades in their cabins for the same reason. There was an eeriness to the darkness outside the window.
The train slowed to a stop for no apparent reason, then minutes later another train passed on the next track over, headed east, possibly carrying tanks and ammunition to the front. Once it passed, the train slowly began to move again.
The morning dragged on as the train made long stops, again for no apparent reason. Some people tried to sleep the extra hours away, while others wandered the hallways. It was only explained later that trains are required to stop when the aerial bombing warnings are in effect.
When the train finally crawled to a stop in Lviv, the passengers disembarked with their pets and bags in tow, some again anxious, some relieved, some a little of both. A man walked down the platform crossing his heart, giving thanks for safe passage. For many of the other passengers, the 22-hour train ride was only the beginning of their journey.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-19/senate-gives-final-congressional-ok-for-40-billion-in-ukraine-aid;2022-05-19;Senate give final OK to $40 billion in Ukraine aid - Los Angeles Times;"The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $40-billion infusion of military and economic aid for Ukraine and its allies Thursday as both parties rallied behind America’s latest, and quite possibly not last, financial salvo against Russia’s invasion.
The 86-11 vote gave final congressional approval to the package, three weeks after President Biden requested a smaller $33-billion version and after a lone Republican opponent delayed Senate passage for a week. Every Democrat and all but 11 Republicans — many of them supporters of former President Trump’s isolationist agenda — backed the measure.
Biden’s quick signature was certain as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack, which has mauled Ukraine’s forces and cities, slogs into a fourth month with no obvious end ahead. That means more casualties and destruction in Ukraine, which has relied heavily on U.S. and Western assistance for its survival, especially advanced arms, with requests for more aid potentially looming.
“Help is on the way, really significant help. Help that could make sure that the Ukrainians are victorious,” said Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) underscoring a goal by Ukraine and its allies that seemed nearly unthinkable when Russia launched its brutal assault three months ago.
The vote was a glaring exception to the partisan divisions that have hindered work on other issues under Biden and that promise to become only less bridgeable as November’s elections for control of Congress draw closer. That includes Republicans blocking Democrats from including billions to combat the relentless pandemic in the measure, leaving their efforts to battle COVID-19 in limbo.
Last week the House approved the Ukraine bill 368-57, with all of those opposed Republicans. Though support in both chambers was unmistakably bipartisan, the GOP defections were noteworthy after Trump, still a potent force in the party, complained that such sums should first be targeted at domestic problems.
Politics
President Biden met Thursday with the leaders of Finland and Sweden after both nations formally applied to join NATO this week.

Schumer called it “beyond troubling” that Republicans were opposing the Ukraine assistance. “It appears more and more that MAGA Republicans are on the same soft-on-Putin playbook that we saw used by former President Trump,” said Schumer, using the Make America Great Again acronym Democrats have been using to cast those Republicans as extremists.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a strong backer of the measure, addressed concerns by his GOP colleagues. He said Ukraine’s defeat would jeopardize America’s European trading partners, increase U.S. security costs there and embolden autocrats in China and elsewhere to grab territory in their regions.
“The most expensive and painful thing America could possibly do in the long run would be to stop investing in sovereignty, stability and deterrence before it’s too late,” McConnell said.
On Wednesday, Schumer said he was not confident this would be the final measure to help Ukraine. “They’re doing the fighting, they’re the ones getting killed, they’re the ones struggling and suffering. The least we can do is give them the weaponry they need,” he said.

Russia scores its first major win with the takeover of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But will it change the course of the war?

The legislation contains around $24 billion for weapons, equipment and military financing for Ukraine, restoring Pentagon stocks of arms sent to the region and paying for U.S. reinforcements sent there. The rest includes economic aid to keep President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government functioning, food programs for countries that rely on Ukraine’s diminished crop production, refugee assistance and funds for Kyiv to investigate Russian war crimes.
Congress approved an initial $13.6-billion measure in March. The combined price tag of nearly $54 billion exceeds what the U.S. spent on all its foreign and military aid in 2019, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who’s long had non-interventionist views, used procedural tactics last week to thwart Schumer and McConnell from moving the measure through the Senate then, citing Ukraine’s urgent need for the assistance.
In a personal criticism seldom seen on the Senate floor, Schumer on Wednesday called Paul’s move “repugnant” and said the delay, with passage inevitable, would “strengthen Putin’s hand.” McConnell, who on Saturday met with Zelensky during a surprise visit to Kyiv, did not speak up in his fellow Kentucky Republican’s defense.
In a brief interview, Paul responded that it would be “repugnant” to disparage “the democratic process” as embodied in Senate rules that he was using.
That spending concerned some Trump-friendly Republicans in Congress on Wednesday.

Moscow is scrambling to adjust to a new security picture in Europe brought about by its invasion of Ukraine, where fighting is ravaging the east.

“It’s, you know, the world’s going to end if you don’t do anything here,” Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who said he would oppose the Ukraine measure. “I’m more worried about the trust fund going broke” that finances Medicare and another that pays for Social Security.
Braun said he’s long pushed for bills that pay for themselves. Asked why saving $40 billion in this instance outweighed stopping Russia, he said, “No. 1, it’s going to pass.”
Another conservative, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said that as costly as the measure is, the aid will protect U.S. national security and said, “If Putin wins, the consequences for America and American taxpayers will be hundreds of billions of dollars.”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a moderate who has clashed with Trump, said in an interview that helping Ukraine defend itself ”is about as smart an investment as we could possibly make.” He added, “What does America First mean? It means that we should first be concerned about the interests of America. I totally agree.”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-19/why-russias-war-in-ukraine-complicates-president-bidens-first-trip-to-asia;2022-05-20;Why Russia’s war in Ukraine complicates President Biden’s first trip to Asia - Los Angeles Times;"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a continent away from South Korea and Japan. But when President Biden meets this week with leaders from Asia and Australia, he will face a slew of challenges tied to the war being waged by the Kremlin.
I’ll be covering Biden’s trip to Asia (follow me on Twitter for updates), and I wanted to leave you with a primer on the obstacles confronting Biden following his arrival Friday in Seoul.



Why is a European war an issue in U.S.-Asia relations?
The biggest factor is time and attention. American presidents have long promised that Asia would be their top foreign policy priority, with a focus on China. The strategy was dubbed the “pivot to Asia” under President Obama. It continued in a different form under President Trump, who cast China as a mortal enemy of his “America first” agenda and tried to broker peace in North Korea.
But urgent crises in Europe or the Middle East have almost always gotten in the way. Biden, nearly 16 months into his tenure, is just now making his first sojourn to the region. Trump made it to Asia — visiting five countries on a marathon trip — in November of his first year in office. It was easier without a pandemic, and Trump ruffled allies with his antagonistic rhetoric. Nonetheless, Trump’s trip sent a signal of engagement.
American allies, so far, seem to be impressed with Biden’s ability to rally international support for Ukraine.
But they are worried that Ukraine is “detracting from the U.S. commitments to Asia,” said Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of “Japan Rearmed: The Politics of Military Power.” “The president himself has said that he’s going there to reassure allies.”
But can’t the administration walk and chew gum at the same time? Why can’t the White House pay attention to Ukraine while still pivoting to Asia?
“They’ll no doubt say that,” said Susan Thornton, a retired diplomat who spent nearly three decades focusing on Asia. “It’s the biggest lie in government, but they’ll say that.”

Thornton and other experts said that handling multiple crises and strategic initiatives is actually very hard. Time is finite, as is the focus of senior advisors and Cabinet secretaries. The U.S. is also spending money and building weapons as part of the effort in Europe, thinning its resources.
Kurt Campbell, coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs at the National Security Council, said it was clear the White House was focusing intense attention on Ukraine. At a forum at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington last week, Campbell said the war was “animating” for Biden and his senior team during “an incredibly intense period, a critical period.”
Even so, it would be bad for the U.S. to take its eye off the ball in Asia. “The larger strategic challenges are going to play out in the Indo-Pacific region,” Campbell said.
“There has been a sense that in previous administrations that we had set off with a determined pace to focus on East Asia or in the Indo-Pacific and then find ourselves with other pressing challenges that perhaps draw us away a little bit,” he continued. “I think there is a deep sense that that can’t happen again.”
National security advisor Jake Sullivan, briefing reporters Wednesday, argued that the two regions are not competing for attention, because Asian allies were cooperating with American-led sanctions against Russia while European allies were investing more in Asia in coordination with the U.S. economic strategy.
How do Asian allies view the invasion of Ukraine?
Warily. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack has sparked concerns among U.S. allies that it could embolden China to take more aggressive military action in the region. Those allies are particularly concerned that Beijing may take military action against Taiwan.
Japan, which has kept a minimal military since changing its constitution after World War II, has been boosting its defense spending, with a proposal to double its budget in the next five years to about $90 billion to counter China and Russia.
“There will be an effort by the Biden administration to reassure both Seoul and Tokyo … that the United States will come to their defense,” said Smith, who pointed out that the U.S. is bound by security agreements to defend those countries, unlike Ukraine, which has no such agreement.
Taiwan also has no such assurance.
So is everyone on board with U.S. sanctions against Russia?
No. Biden’s trip has two missions. He will visit newly inaugurated South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who took office in June, and meet with a group of allies known as the Quad.
The Quad — established chiefly to counter Chinese power — comprises the U.S., Japan, Australia and India.
India is the wild card. It has been fortifying its growing economy and military with Russian arms and cheap oil. Its government has resisted signing onto sanctions or strong statements condemning Russia, despite pressure from the U.S.
Michael Green, an Asia specialist in the George W. Bush administration, said creating a united front that includes India “will be the hardest diplomacy of the trip.”
He predicts behind-the-scenes pressure on India to take a stronger stand on Russia, but nothing public that would “shame” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
It’s too important to keep the group together in the face of an increasingly strong China.
“They want to focus on the big prize here” of bringing India “inside the tent” of countries aligned against China, said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
You haven’t mentioned North Korea. Are we done worrying about them?
If only. Pyongyang fired off three ballistic missiles last week in another test designed to remind the world that it remains committed to its nuclear program. Such missile launches frequently occur before high-profile American visits to the region.
The White House said more may be on the way.
“We’ve indicated in quite clear terms that our intelligence does reflect the genuine possibility that there will be either further missile tests — including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test or, frankly, both — in the days leading into, on or after the president’s trip to the region,” Sullivan said.
“We are preparing for all contingencies, including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in Korea or in Japan,” he added, telling reporters that the administration is in contact with officials in South Korea, Japan and China.
Still, Campbell said the U.S. government has “tried on numerous occasions to reach out to North Korean interlocutors to establish dialogue.”
But it has not happened. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader, retreated further from the world stage during the COVID-19 pandemic and is largely in control of where and when he restarts nuclear negotiations.
The issue is likely to come up when Biden meets with South Korea’s Yoon. But don’t expect any progress. Yoon’s predecessor, Moon Jae-in, pushed hard for a peace treaty and other forms of reconciliation with North Korea. Yoon is expected to take a harder line against the rogue state."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-11/ukraine-retakes-territory-east-war-russia;2022-05-12;Ukraine retakes territory in the east amid Russian attacks - Los Angeles Times;"The Ukrainian military pressed its counteroffensive against Russian troops Wednesday — pushing them back from the northeastern city of Kharkiv — in a move that observers say could propel the conflict into a new phase, as U.S. intelligence officials warned that Moscow was preparing for a protracted war.
Driving back Moscow’s troops to fewer than a dozen miles from the Russian border, Ukraine said it was able to claw back a constellation of settlements north of Kharkiv.
The Ukrainian forces are now so close to Russia that, for the first time, a civilian in Russia died in cross-border shelling, according to Russian officials. One person died and six, including a 14-year-old boy, were wounded in the small rural village of Solokhi, about six miles from Ukraine, said Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, on the Telegram messaging app. Residents of Solokhi, he said, would be taken to a safe place to avoid the shelling.
Ukrainian troops’ move north reduces pressure on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and a primary target of Russian shelling since the beginning of the war, according to regional Gov. Oleh Sinegubov.
“The occupiers had even less opportunity to fire on the regional center,” Sinegubov said on Telegram.


In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to the lengthy conflict anticipated, saying he was grateful to the U.S. after the House of Representatives resoundingly approved a $40-billion aid package for his country that Zelensky said would provide weapons and ammunition and support an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes.
“These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine’s defense,” he said.

Russian bombs wrecked a small museum holding works by one of Ukraine’s best-known artists, Maria Prymachenko. But townspeople rescued a national legacy.

As the war concludes its 11th week, the director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency characterized the conflict as deadlocked.
“The Russians aren’t winning, and the Ukrainians aren’t winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” Lt. Gen. Scott D. Berrier told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
Analysts with the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in their Wednesday assessment that the Ukrainian counteroffensive north of Kharkiv had “forced Russian troops onto the defensive,” forcing them to replenish efforts to prevent Ukraine from further advancing to the Russian border.
Still, Russia seemed eager Wednesday to secure its territorial gains in Ukraine, with a Moscow-installed administrator in Kherson — the first city to fall in the war — calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex the area instead of leaving it to become a Russia-aligned breakaway republic like those declared by separatists in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
“The city of Kherson is Russia,” Kirill Stremousov was quoted as saying in a report by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. “There will be no Kherson People’s Republic on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums. It will be a decree based on an appeal from the Kherson regional leadership to the Russian president, and there will be a request to include the region into a proper region of the Russian Federation.”
Later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “such a fateful decision must have an absolutely clear legal background, a legal justification [and] be absolutely legitimate, as was the case with Crimea.”

Russia presses new bombing runs in eastern and southern Ukraine as U.S. officials warn or annexation plans

Russia annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula on the Black Sea with an ethnic-Russian majority and a vital Russian naval base, in 2014. The annexation has not been recognized by the West and was followed by eight years of fighting in Ukraine’s east between Ukrainian forces and Kremlin-backed separatists that killed 14,000 people before Russia invaded the country Feb. 24 of this year.
Ukrainian forces’ reported breakthrough near Kharkiv comes as fighting rages in other parts of the country. About 80 miles south of Kharkiv, Russian troops fired on the city of Lozova, injuring a civilian, Mayor Serhiy Zelensky said in a Facebook post. And about 60 miles east of Lozova, Russia fired missiles at two areas of the city of Slovyansk, the main target of Moscow’s forces in eastern Ukraine, according to its mayor, Vadym Liakh. There were no casualties.
Around Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, an outcrop in the Black Sea roughly 90 miles south of the coastal city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces struck Russian air defenses and resupply vessels, according to a British Defense Ministry intelligence update Wednesday.
The island gained outsize symbolic importance early in the war, when Ukrainian soldiers stationed in a garrison there rebuffed a Russian warship’s demand to surrender with a colorful rejoinder.
The British Defense Ministry said that if Moscow can consolidate its position on the island with enhanced defenses, the outcrop could be used to “dominate the northwestern Black Sea.” But a redoubt there would also “offer Ukraine more opportunities to engage Russian troops” and destroy materiel.

The Russian leader stops short of calling for a wider war mobilization during an annual military parade but vows to capture Ukraine’s Donbas region.

In the beleaguered port city of Mariupol, Russian forces continued their attack on Ukrainian defenders bunkered in the sprawling Azovstal steelworks plant.
Those defenders issued an urgent plea Tuesday, publishing a series of photos on the Telegram channel of the Azov regiment fighters, calling on the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to help rescue hundreds of servicemen now living “without necessary medication and even food.”
“The servicemen you see in the photo and hundreds more at the Azovstal plant defended Ukraine and the entire civilized world with serious injuries at the cost of their own health,” the fighters’ statement said. “Are Ukraine and the world community now unable to protect and take care of them?”
Meanwhile, Ukraine announced that it would suspend gas shipments through a transit point that handles about one-third of the gas delivered from Russia to Europe.
In a statement Tuesday, Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz company declared “force majeure,” saying it would stop deliveries through Sokhranivka as of Wednesday because of interference by Russian and separatist troops now in control of the area.
Naftogaz said that “occupying authorities” had disrupted communications and interfered in the operation of the pipeline and that it was “no longer able to carry out uninterrupted and effective operational and technological control” over its facilities. The company said it asked Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas company, to transfer the relevant volumes to another conduit located in a Ukrainian-controlled area.
Gazprom declined, with company executives saying that they had not received any confirmation regarding the circumstances of the force majeure and that in any case it was technically impossible to switch the distribution pathway, a report by Russian state news operator Tass said.
With Russia’s disruption of the Black Sea trade route contributing to rising global food prices and shortages of corn and wheat, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Wednesday urged Russia to end its blockade of Ukraine’s ports.
“Ukraine is a critical source of agricultural products and a key link in the global food supply chain,” he said in a statement. “Russia’s blockade is preventing these goods from leaving and threatening millions of people around the world with malnutrition and famine. The blockade must end.”
Although the U.S. and European nations have broadly come together in recent months to penalize Russia with sanctions, some fear that unity could wane as the war grinds on and takes an economic toll.
On Wednesday, European Union talks over a proposed embargo on Russian oil stalled after Hungary, which is heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas, refused to agree.

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.


Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, announced Wednesday that a Russian soldier in Ukrainian custody will be the first to stand trial for an alleged war crime. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of Russia’s Kantemirovskaya tank division, is charged with shooting an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in the head in late February. The shooting occurred in a village in northeastern Ukraine’s Sumy region.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday that there are no “immediate chances of a peace agreement” or “immediate chances of a local cease-fire,” but that diplomacy is still essential to “save lives and improve the humanitarian situation.”
Guterres also defended his visit to Putin in late April.
“It makes full sense to talk to the leader of the Russian Federation; it makes full sense to talk to any other relevant actors in the present crisis,” he said. The lives of civilians rescued from the bunkers of Mariupol are reason enough for him to “meet anybody in any part of the world without having any doubt that that is the right thing to do,” he said.
In Lviv, the western city that is a crossroads for those fleeing the war and those trying to return to homes they previously abandoned, the central train station was its usual hubbub of activity Wednesday. An entire refugee ecosystem has sprung up in and around the landmark Art Nouveau station: A World Food Kitchen tent was serving borscht, and a free cafe slowly filled with new arrivals.

Those needing a respite after hours or days of travel were steered to resting rooms and a nursery. A few who stepped off trains with little but the clothes on their backs were ushered toward stacks of donated supplies: boxes of diapers, bottles of shampoo, piles of sweatshirts.
Volunteers braced for the arrival of an afternoon train from Pokrovsk, a heavily bombarded town in the province of Donetsk, in the eastern battle zone. “We know these people are going to be in bad shape — hungry and tired and scared,” said volunteer Valentin Andrushko.
After another train pulled in from Zaporizhzhia, a southeastern city that has been a way station for people fleeing Mariupol and its environs, a young volunteer spoke quietly with an elderly woman who was leaning on a cane and sobbing. She would briefly collect herself, nodding and wiping her eyes, and then break down again.

Some travelers were making a reverse journey, back to homes they had left weeks or months ago. Iryna Dragunova, a Lviv teacher, was seeing off her brother and sister-in-law, who were heading east to Kyiv, which they fled in the early weeks of the war. Neighbors in the capital told the couple that, other than some windows that shattered during a bombardment nearby, their apartment was intact.
“Even if it still doesn’t feel so safe, and even if I beg them to stay here with me, they just want to go home,” said Dragunova.
Together with her mother, 21-year-old Liz Ivanchenko was headed for the central city of Dnipro. When they fled nearly two months ago, they were unable to persuade her 83-year-old grandfather to come along. But now, alone and ailing, he had agreed to accompany them back to Poland.
“We want him to be safe with us,” Ivanchenko said. “He wouldn’t go at first, but now he understands this war could go on for a very long time.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-18/ukraine-russia-prisoner-exchange-mariupol-fighters;2022-05-19;Fate uncertain for Ukrainian fighters Russia calls 'Nazis' - Los Angeles Times;"The first Russian soldier to be tried for war crimes pleaded guilty to killing a Ukrainian civilian on Wednesday as fears grew  over the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol a day earlier.
Ukrainian officials said they are negotiating to exchange the beleaguered fighters for Russian prisoners of war. Russia’s parliament was expected to but did not take up a resolution Wednesday blocking the swap. Lawmakers had cited the Azov regiment, a  militia with neo-Nazi roots that was absorbed into Ukraine’s military and which Moscow says still comprises Nazis.
Troops from the regiment held out in the steel plant for weeks in a last stand against a complete Russian takeover of Mariupol, in Ukraine’s southeast.
Their fate was left hanging even as 21-year-old Russian Sgt. Vadim Shyshimarin pleaded guilty in Kyiv in the fatal shooting of  the unarmed civilian in the northeastern Sumy region on Feb. 28, four days after Russian forces swept into Ukraine. Shyshimarin, who could be sentenced to life in prison, shot the man in the head.
The trial is the first war crimes proceeding in Ukraine since the fighting began — and as Russian forces continue to strike military and civilian targets across the country. Ukraine’s prosecutor general has said that her office is preparing cases against 41 Russian troops accused of killing and raping civilians, bombing civilian infrastructure and looting.
It was unclear whether Shyshimarin’s trial would affect negotiations over the Ukrainian fighters evacuated from Mariupol. But Russian lawmakers have spoken harshly of the Azov regiment.
“Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,” Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia’s lower house, the State Duma, said Tuesday about the Ukrainian prisoners, who are being held in a former penal colony in a Russian-controlled part of eastern Ukraine.
Investigators in the Kremlin have already indicated that they plan to interrogate the Ukrainian captives over alleged war crimes, and the country’s Supreme Court has been asked to label the Azov regiment a terrorist organization.

Russia scores its first major win with the takeover of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But will it change the course of the war?



Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said talks were ongoing to exchange prisoners and evacuate an undisclosed number of Ukrainian fighters still inside the encircled steelworks. Russia said nearly 1,000 Ukrainian troops emerged from the Azovstal complex and handed themselves over this week, but Ukraine has declined to give figures.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for patience, describing Ukraine’s pullout from Mariupol as a way to save the Azovstal defenders’ lives and the negotiations over them as requiring “delicacy and time.”
The uncertainty surrounding the Ukrainian fighters, many of whom were seriously injured, adds one more tense chapter to a battle that has become a focal point in the nearly 3-month-old war.
Russian forces were thwarted for weeks from capturing Mariupol, a key port city along the Sea of Azov, because of the stubborn defense mounted by the Azov regiment and other Ukrainian fighters inside the steel mill.

In a tranquil Ukrainian monastery, dozens driven from homes by war find refuge. The nuns say they will offer shelter as long as it’s needed.

Their resistance prevented Moscow from freeing up troops and other resources to fight elsewhere and “inflicted costly personnel losses amongst Russian forces,” Britain’s Defense Ministry said in a daily assessment Wednesday.
Though Moscow has now all but won the fight for Mariupol, its long siege has emerged as a symbol of the grinding road ahead for Russia’s military, which now seems resigned to a long-term fight.
“The war is entering a protracted phase,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told a meeting of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on Tuesday. “We can already see how the Russian occupiers are beginning engineering and fortification works in the Kherson region [and in the southeastern city of] Zaporizhzhia in order to move to defense if necessary.”
The longer the conflict lasts, however, the longer the Kremlin risks entrenching its isolation and galvanizing Western allies to join together.
That was manifested Wednesday when Finland and Sweden formally handed in their applications to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, reversing decades of military nonalignment.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III welcomed his Swedish counterpart to the Pentagon the same day.
Austin and the Swedish minister, Peter Hultqvist, discussed the war in Ukraine and how to protect Sweden from Russia’s wrath over its NATO aspirations. Sweden and other nations are concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin would punish any country attempting to join NATO.
The U.S. is offering Sweden a number of unspecified security guarantees that could include money and weapons. The countries’ militaries have previously worked together in joint exercises.
“Being able to provide security assistance [to Sweden] would not be a major leap for us, not at all,” a senior Pentagon  official said.
Austin’s remarks on the Sweden issue came as the U.S. officially reopened its embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, pledging to “stand” with the Ukrainian people against Russian attacks.
Early in the war, the U.S. moved its diplomats to Lviv in western Ukraine, then to Poland. In the last week, those diplomats have begun returning to Kyiv, after embassies from other nations also reopened.
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the returning diplomats’ safety will be assured. Administration officials have declined to discuss details, including whether U.S. Marines will be deployed to guard the embassy, as they do in many countries.
Zelensky, meanwhile, said in his nightly address that Russia has fired more than 2,000 missiles in its attack on Ukraine. Those missiles make up a large part of Putin’s arsenal, he added.
The missiles mostly hit civilian infrastructure, Zelensky said, including the city of Mykolaiv in the south and Dnipro in central Ukraine in the last day.
Ukraine plans to restore its control over cities that are  “under temporary occupation,” Zelensky said, such as Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar and Mariupol.
Those communities “should know that Ukraine will return,” he said.


At least 3,752 civilians have been killed and 4,062 injured since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations, which says the actual casualty figures are considerably higher.
Many of those deaths are believed to be the result of war crimes, which will be examined by an unprecedented team of 42 investigators, forensic experts and other personnel from the International Criminal Court, the organization’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said Tuesday.
“Now more than ever we need to show the law in action,” Khan said.
At least four more civilians were killed by Russian shelling Wednesday in the eastern region of Luhansk, according to Gov. Serhiy Haidai. One child was injured in the attack and was receiving treatment at an intensive care unit in Dnipro.

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.

Russia controls most of Luhansk — where pro-Russia separatists have declared their own republic — and has been pounding the remaining Ukrainian defenses in the region to break the stalemate, most recently with the aid of 15 helicopters deployed to the area.
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Wednesday morning that its forces had repelled 12 Russian attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the previous 24 hours, destroying three enemy tanks, three artillery systems and six units of armored combat vehicles. The claim could not be independently verified.
Donetsk and Luhansk make up the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland where Ukrainian and Russian forces have sparred since 2014.

Ukraine said firefighters were battling blazes in Odesa after seven missiles struck targets, including a shopping center and a warehouse, killing at least one person and injuring five. Video posted on Facebook by the Ukrainian army showed rescue groups surrounded by smoking rubble.
Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military, said in an update that a separate strike by three Kinzhal hypersonic missiles had also hit “tourism” locations in Odesa.
The Kinzhal is more destructive than conventional missiles because its speed — several times that of sound — enables it to better evade antimissile systems. Its use on Odesa could not be verified, though Russia first claimed to unleash the new weapons in March on targets in western Ukraine.
Pentagon analysts have noticed an uptick in Russian manpower and sorties by fighter jets deployed in Ukraine since Monday.
A senior Defense official said Tuesday that an estimated 2,000 additional Russian troops were moved into the battlefield, probably by air. He could not say what part of the country they were deployed to but noted most Russian offensive attacks remain concentrated in the Donbas region and the ports of Mariupol and Odesa.
Air sorties, which have averaged 200 to 300 per day, totaled more than 300 in the last 24 hours, the official said.
Pentagon spokesman John F. Kirby told reporters that he could not cite “any evidence” that Russia used hypersonic missiles in its attack on Odesa, as Ukrainian officials have claimed. But he noted that Moscow has already fired such weapons in this war and that Russian forces are running through their precision-guided missiles “at a pretty fast clip.”
Also Tuesday, U.S. officials sounded the alarm over their ability to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III wrote Congress  this week to urge lawmakers to approve up to $40 billion in weapons and other aid for Ukraine before the current $13.5-billion package is depleted. Tuesday evening, the House did just that, emphatically approving the $40 billion, in a bipartisan commitment to thwart Russian President Vladimir Putin’s   nearly 11-week-old war.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that the final $100 million in that package runs out next week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, called on world powers to break a Russian blockade of his nation’s ports.
Citing the key role that Odesa, in the southwest near Moldova, plays in the global agricultural trade, Zelensky said in a video address that shortages of grain exports were bound to get worse if attacks continued and Western powers did not put an end to the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. Nations around the world depend heavily on grain from the fertile Black Sea region, which some call the “breadbasket of Europe.”
“For the first time in decades, there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa,” Zelensky said. “Probably this has never happened in Odesa since World War II.
“Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible.”

A Los Angeles-based aid group says not all volunteers, even those with pertinent skills, would be a good fit for operations near a warzone. Still, one Angeleno has flown to Eastern Europe.

Ukraine is “sitting on 8 billion euros’ worth [about $8.4 billion] of wheat” that cannot be exported amid the war and Russia’s blockade of Black Sea ports, the president of the European Investment Bank, Werner Hoyer, said Tuesday.
“They are sowing like crazy right now, and they will expect probably a good harvest, maybe 70% of last year’s harvest, in a couple of months,” Hoyer said. “And then what to do with it?”
In a report released this month, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicted a greater economic slowdown and more inflationary pressure in its regions as a result of the war. The bank’s research suggests that Ukraine’s economy will shrink 30% this year.
On the other side of Ukraine, in the southeast, officials said Tuesday that Russian attacks continued to hit the port city of Mariupol, where dramatic scenes have unfolded in the last week of civilians rescued from a vast steelworks where they and a group of fighters were sheltering.
Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the mayor, said on Telegram that he believed 100 people remained in the Azovstal steel complex’s underground tunnels. Andryushchenko said that the area was still under fire Tuesday.
The situation in the plant has been hard to ascertain even for Ukrainian authorities, who in earlier days said they believed all or most civilians had been evacuated.
Mariupol, under near-total Russian control, was the site Monday of a Russian military observation of Victory Day, a Russian holiday marking the Soviet triumph over Nazis during World War II.
World & Nation
Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.


Some analysts had predicted that  Putin, who presided over a highly orchestrated celebration in Moscow complete with military marches and music, would use the occasion to declare all-out war on Ukraine. Instead, he lashed out against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S., saying Russia was responding to “aggression” by Western powers.
In Mariupol, Andryushchenko said that while Russian troops held celebratory exercises in the city, “no excitement or joy on the street was particularly noticeable. ... Something went wrong with the holiday because Mariupol is Ukraine, not Moscow.”
With Moscow having declared victory over Mariupol — which would give it one piece of a desired land corridor linking Russia, Crimea and western Ukraine — and military gains somewhat stalled along the eastern Donbas battlefront, American and British military analysts say attacks on Odesa and the west could increase as a way to lure Ukrainian firepower from the east.
In the nation’s northeast around Kharkiv, which has been under near-daily assault since the beginning of the war but remains in Ukrainian control, a local leader said Tuesday that bodies were still being recovered from attacks in March.
The Ukrainian military was gradually pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, Zelensky said in his nightly address.
World & Nation
As many as 60 people are feared dead at a school in Ukraine. Zelensky compares the fight against Russia to World War II battle against Nazi Germany.


Regional administrator Oleh Sinegubov said in a Telegram post that dozens of bodies were found in Izyum in the rubble of a residential building that collapsed under missile fire in March. Izyum is about 75 miles from Kharkiv, which is the second-largest city in Ukraine.
“This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population,” Sinegubov said.
Air-raid sirens were also reported to have sounded Tuesday in Luhansk and Dnipro.
Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said on social media that the region was hit with Russian attacks 22 times over the last day.
“The Russians fired en masse on all possible routes out of the region,” Haidai said.
Zelensky, who since March has received various Western leaders eager to show their support for Ukraine, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), hosted the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands on Tuesday.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock toured Kyiv and bombed-out suburbs, including Irpin, with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra.
The visit by Baerbock, the first German government official to travel to Ukraine since the war began Feb. 24, could mark a shift in a tense relationship that has seen Kyiv accuse Berlin of being too slow to send military aid and to formulate a ban on Russian energy imports. Germany is among the European Union nations with the strongest trade relationships with Russia.
In April, Kyiv said German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was not welcome to visit. Last week, Zelensky relented and invited Steinmeier and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the capital.
Speaking in Bucha, the suburb where the discovery of mass graves last month brought international condemnation of Russia, Baerbock said Germany was committed to supporting Ukraine.
“We owe it to the victims that we don’t just commemorate them here but that we hold the perpetrators to account,” she said.
Zelensky also spoke via video Tuesday to the Slovakian parliament. He repeated a warning he has given other nations that Russia’s ambitions do not stop at Ukraine’s borders.
World & Nation
A video of Oksana Balandina, who lost both legs to a land mine, and Viktor Vasyliv dancing at their hospital wedding has lifted spirits in Ukraine.

“If we fail to stop the Russian troops, they will come everywhere they can, including to the territory of Slovakia,” Zelensky said.

The United Nations has confirmed at least 3,381 civilian deaths during the war. Speaking  Tuesday at a news conference in Geneva, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Mission in Ukraine said the real number is substantially higher.

The war has caused nearly 6 million Ukrainians to flee for other nations, according to the U.N. Eight million have been displaced internally.
After meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Moldova on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that “it is impossible to meet refugees and not be deeply moved by their stories.”
“This tragedy demonstrates that war is a senseless thing, and that this war must stop,” he said.

Hello, it’s Monday, May 9, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Jill Biden and Justin Trudeau visit Ukraine
As air-raid sirens wailed  in cities and towns across Ukraine, First Lady Jill Biden made a foray into the embattled country, meeting her Ukrainian counterpart near the Slovakian border. Biden, whose trip came amid a four-day visit to front-line countries in Eastern Europe, said she wanted to make the visit on Mother’s Day to underscore that “this war has been brutal, and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.”
The day also saw another high-profile Western visit from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who traveled to a suburban town outside Kyiv where evidence has emerged of gruesome atrocities committed by Russian troops during a monthlong occupation. And U.S. diplomats returned to Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, with the U.S. Embassy tweeting a photo of acting Ambassador Kristina Kvien’s arrival.
Meanwhile, rescuers in an eastern Ukrainian village dug through the rubble of a bombarded school-turned-shelter where up to 60 people were missing and feared dead, according to Ukrainian officials.

Limiting the frenzy of well drilling on California farms

In farming areas across the Central Valley, a well-drilling frenzy has accelerated over the last year as growers turn to pumping more groundwater during the drought, even as falling water levels leave hundreds of nearby homes with dry wells.
Now, some state legislators are supporting a bill that they say would strengthen oversight and limit the well-drilling frenzy by requiring a review of permits for new wells by the same local agencies that are charged with managing groundwater.
The way the system stands, counties have been signing off on permits and agricultural landowners have been “rushing to get their wells in” before limits on pumping take effect.

Few LAPD officers were punished for not wearing COVID masks
As the COVID-19 pandemic raged through Los Angeles in 2020 and 2021, LAPD officials mandated that officers wear protective masks while at work and when interacting with the public. They also promised to hold those who didn’t accountable.
However, new data show that few officers were ever formally punished for disobeying the directive, despite hundreds of complaints from the public and internally within the department.
In 2020 and 2021, just two mask complaints — one per year — out of 268 that were filed resulted in formal punishment for the involved officers, according to annual reports from the LAPD’s Professional Standards Bureau, which includes internal affairs.

Low-income women struggle to get abortions in Texas
If the U.S. Supreme Court eliminates the constitutional right to abortion by overturning Roe vs. Wade — as it is widely expected to do in coming weeks — Texas and at least 25 other conservative states are likely to ban most abortions.
But already in Texas, low-income Latinas face major obstacles when it comes to ending unwanted pregnancies. Last year, Texas enacted the strictest abortion law in the country. With no exception for rape or incest, the so-called heartbeat law effectively bans the procedure after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually at about six weeks, before many women even realize they’re pregnant.
What other places can teach SoCal about using less water
Millions of Southern Californians will wake up to the region’s most severe water restrictions ever on June 1, with local water agencies under orders to slash the use of supplies from the State Water Project by 35%. Adaptation may be difficult, but there are other cities, states and nations that can offer guidance.
For example, the city of Healdsburg in Sonoma County cut water use by 56% last summer. The Las Vegas area has reduced per-capita water use by almost half. And in Israel, long-term investments in wastewater recycling, desalination and other technologies have helped the water-scarce country secure ample supplies for cities and farms.
The stories of how each of these areas have worked to address their urgent water needs offer parallel examples that show how Southern California might respond to the water shortage.

A bid to stop freeway expansions in California hits a roadblock: organized labor. Labor leaders contend that limiting freeway widening overestimates the state’s ability to transition from an automobile-centered culture and does so at the expense of good-paying jobs.
Angel Stadium deal fine print: 80% less affordable housing near the ballpark. Under the original terms of the sale, the city credited Angels owner Arte Moreno’s development company with $124 million toward the inclusion of 466 units of affordable housing on the site. Now, with Moreno paying back about 80% of the rebate in cash, he no longer is required to build about 80% of those units.
Robert Evans wouldn’t approve of the man playing him on TV. He would be wrong. In Paramount+’s “The Offer,” which chronicles the epic “almost didn’t happen” journey of “The Godfather” from book to screen, Matthew Goode takes on the role of Evans, who fought for (and sometimes against) Francis Ford Coppola’s iconic vision.
Anza-Borrego park faces claims of neglecting water tanks, leading to bighorn sheep deaths. It’s the latest salvo in a fight over whether, and to what extent, the park should prop up one species threatened by climate change. New management has raised concerns about the cost and possible futility of such endeavors.
Officials investigate a string of homicides in California state prisons. An inmate, 22-year-old Camilo Banoslopez, is the fourth homicide at a California prison in the last eight days. Officials said Banoslopez was attacked at California State Prison in Sacramento by inmates Albert Calvillo, 30, Irvin Rodriguez, 36, Osbaldo Velasquez, 38, and Jose Avila, 39.
A landslide destroyed O.C. homes 24 years ago. A developer wants to build there again. The developer, Barry Hon of Laguna Niguel Properties LLC, is familiar with the risk. Many also worry that officials will use the increasing demand for housing across Southern California and a requirement that the city zone for more than 1,200 new units as justification to approve the project, when there are safer places in the city to build.
Police arrest dozens at numerous illegal street takeovers in L.A. area. Street takeovers often involve a pack of cars blocking an intersection where drivers perform dangerous maneuvers with their cars. LAPD Sgt. Jodie McGee of the Valley Traffic Division told Fox 11 News that the participants often wreak havoc in communities.

Mexican officials say a notorious cartel killed two Tijuana journalists. Critics aren’t buying it. The #YoSíSoyPeriodista (Yes, I Am a Journalist) collective, which has pressed for accountability and held protests about the homicides, noted that there was no known evidence for the government’s claim that Lourdes Maldonado was killed because she “denounced drug dealers” operating in the neighborhood where she lived.
Beijing loyalist John Lee was elected as Hong Kong’s next leader. He will replace current leader Carrie Lam on July 1. Her five-year term was marked by huge pro-democracy protests calling for her resignation, a security crackdown that has quashed virtually all dissent and the recent COVID-19 wave that overwhelmed the health system — events that have undermined Hong Kong’s reputation as an international business hub with Western-style freedoms.
There is anger among Afghan women as a face veil edict splits the Taliban. Wearing the all-encompassing burqa is preferred by the Taliban,  which issued a new dress code for women appearing in public. The edict said only a woman’s eyes should be visible. It was a major blow to the rights of women in Afghanistan, who for two decades had been living with relative freedom before the Taliban takeover last August.

A Texas woman sought an abortion. Here’s how far California went to help her. Stephanie shared her story to help explain what it really means for California to be a sanctuary state for abortion — how urgent it is that this state keep the promises its politicians are making — and to let others in need of an abortion know that there is help in these dark and frightening days.
For much of the last 36 years, Oceanside’s famous ‘Top Gun’ house has been boarded up and moved from place to place as the city’s downtown waterfront exploded with growth.
But on Friday, the 135-year-old Victorian cottage that was featured in the 1986 Tom Cruise film “Top Gun” celebrated its new permanent home and occupant. Now situated in an oceanfront lot on the grounds of the year-old Mission Pacific Hotel at 201 N. Myers St., the Top Gun House is now home to HIGH-pie, a nostalgic Americana-inspired pie shop.
The shop sells fried-to-order hand pies filled with apple or cherry compote and “a la mode” hand pies filled with mascarpone ice cream. The pies are served on a popsicle stick with optional dipping sauces including salted caramel and lemon curd. The shop also sells coffee and other drinks and souvenir T-shirts and hats.
The House Judiciary Committee began impeachment hearings 48 years ago, which led to the resignation of President Nixon.
In 1972, several men linked to the Nixon White House had broken into the Watergate office complex, where the Democratic National Committee had offices. In February 1974, the House of Representatives voted to allow the Judiciary Committee to review grounds for impeachment of the president and gave the committee unlimited subpoena power — used to obtain Oval Office tapes of Nixon’s conversations with aides.
Nixon resigned a few months later. According to The Times, in his speech announcing his resignation, Nixon said he no longer had a “strong political base in the Congress” to warrant continuing his fight against impeachment. He admitted to making mistakes of judgment in the handling of Watergate but stopped short of acknowledging any guilt for the coverup conspiracy.

Only now, however, does that seem to be true.
Herculean resistance by a few hundred Ukrainian fighters, holed up in the city’s sprawling steel factory, staved off Russian troops and artillery for weeks. Many died or were wounded. Civilians also cowered for survival in a labyrinth of tunnels underneath the plant. Ukrainian commanders said they would never surrender.
But this week, after most civilians were rescued by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the battle ended. About 260 Ukrainian soldiers became prisoners and were transported to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s loss of Mariupol — the first major victory in Russia’s nearly three-month war — is symbolically and operationally painful.
Why did Russia fight so hard to take Mariupol?
Mariupol sits in southeastern Ukraine, on the Sea of Azov. Across the blue waters, a little more than 30 miles, lies Russia.
It has been a bustling port for importing goods and exporting  grain and other agricultural products. It is not as storied as Odesa, roughly 325 miles to the west, but is an important cog in the Ukrainian economic machine.
Capturing Mariupol gives Russia a land bridge between Ukrainian territories that it occupied illegally several years ago. From Donetsk, an area in the southeastern Donbas region that Russia-backed separatists seized in 2014, to the Crimean peninsula, occupied and annexed by Russia that same year, controlling Mariupol connects the two and gives Russia freer passage across the south and east.
Is there additional symbolic or political significance for Russia’s leaders?
Putin has eagerly sought a victory in this war, after his early calculations seemed to have misfired. Far from toppling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within days of the Feb. 24 invasion and installing a puppet government, Putin, facing fierce resistance, had to retreat from the capital, Kyiv. And Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which at one time seemed to be on the brink of falling to Russian forces, has fought back and pushed the enemy farther north.
With Mariupol, Putin can finally point to a significant achievement in a conflict that has defied expectations on both sides, claimed thousands of lives and spawned around 6 million refugees.

And, with Mariupol settled — presumably — Russia can redeploy its combat forces from the port, once about 20,000-strong, according to U.S. military intelligence, to the tough battles unfolding elsewhere in the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. The strategy of Russian forces is to encircle Ukrainian soldiers in what looks to be a war of attrition in the east.
And Ukraine’s interest?
The besieged port also became a symbol of resistance and survival for Ukrainians.
The parents and children, and their pets, who sheltered in the steelworks tunnels were shown in dire, dark conditions, with little food or water, in pictures taken by soldiers and posted on social media. Some who escaped spoke of not seeing the sun for two months. Many Ukrainians considered them heroes for their determination and persistence.
What will happen to the Ukrainian soldiers now in Russian hands?
Russia does not have a stellar record in its treatment of prisoners of war. Moreover, some Ukrainian survivors have reported their shock at the hatred Russian soldiers seemed to have for them, apparently buying into Putin’s propaganda about Ukraine being awash with Nazis.
Zelensky said he wanted the soldiers brought home as soon as possible. Several prisoner swaps have taken place in this war. Such a deal was apparently worked out in Mariupol, but the future of those soldiers in Russian hands is uncertain.
“To bring the boys home, the work continues, and this work needs delicacy. And time,” Zelensky said.
Amnesty International, the human rights organization, also expressed alarm over the soldiers’ fate.
“Amnesty International has documented summary killings of captives by Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, as well as the extrajudicial executions of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces in recent weeks,” the organization said in a statement. “The Azov Battalion soldiers who surrendered today must not meet the same fate.”
Can Mariupol be rebuilt?
Not quickly — even if the war were to end soon. Relentless Russian bombing has obliterated apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, and enormous swaths of infrastructure, in what was once a bustling, cosmopolitan city of nearly half a million people. Mariupol looks like a massive wildfire marched through, uncontrolled. Officials say it is too soon to contemplate recovery and rebuilding: The priority is still survival."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-20/russian-bombardment-ukraine-donbas-hell-zelensky;2022-05-21;Russian attacks have turned east Ukraine into 'hell' - Los Angeles Times;"With full control of the steel plant that transfixed the world for months and a tightened grip on Ukraine’s southern coast, Russia redoubled its assault Friday on the eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.
In the vicinity of Severodonetsk — the region’s easternmost city still in Ukrainian hands — at least a dozen people were killed and scores of homes destroyed, the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, reported on social media.
The nearby city of Lysychansk also came under sustained fire, according to Ukrainian military officials, who said their troops had repelled a series of attacks in the Donbas over the last 24 hours, destroying 14 armored vehicles and shooting down a Russian drone.
And about 120 miles west in the Kharkiv region, a Russian missile destroyed the newly renovated Palace of Culture in the city of Lozova.
Russian military authorities also made their biggest victory of the war official on Friday, announcing that their forces in the southern port city of Mariupol had “completely liberated” the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, where thousands of Ukrainian fighters had hunkered down for more than two months in a brutal standoff.
Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that all Ukrainian fighters had been removed from the underground bunkers of the factory, according to Russia’s state-run news agency RIA Novosti.
The last group of 531 Ukrainian soldiers at the steel factory surrendered Friday, bringing the total evacuated since Monday to 2,439, according to the ministry.
There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. This week, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that it had registered “hundreds” of Ukrainian prisoners of war from Azovstal.
Experts at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said the discrepancy could be because of reporting delays. But they also raised the possibility that Russian officials intentionally overstated the number of evacuated Ukrainian fighters — either to maximize the number of Russian prisoners of war they can bring home in an exchange or to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they were locked in a lengthy stalemate with only hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers.
Earlier Friday, Maj. Denys Prokopenko, the Ukrainian commander of the Azov regiment that led the defense of Mariupol, posted a video statement saying that senior military leadership had issued an order to stop defending the city in order to save the “lives and health” of servicemen.

“I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honors,” Prokopenko said in a video posted on Telegram.
Despite some battlefield successes, the growing war of attrition has exacted a grievous toll on Ukraine’s civilians and infrastructure, with people killed or maimed, houses pulverized and power cut off in hard-hit communities.
World & Nation
A Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since the start of the Ukraine war says he fatally shot a civilian on orders from two officers.


In a Friday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western allies to hold Russia financially responsible for the devastation it was wreaking across his country.
“Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital,” he said. “Each blown-up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut-down business.”
Russian funds and property under the jurisdiction of allied countries, Zelensky said, must be “seized or frozen” and then distributed to a special fund for Ukrainian victims
“That would be fair,” he said. “And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us.”
To bolster Ukraine’s defense, the U.S. Senate approved $40 billion in new aid on Thursday, sending the package to President Biden for his promised signature. In addition, Germany’s finance minister said Friday that the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations would allocate $19.8 billion in aid as part of what the G-7 declared was its commitment “to our united response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine.”
Western military and humanitarian assistance have been crucial to Ukraine’s ability to defy an enemy whose military might, both in personnel and weaponry, dwarfs its own.
“This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,” Zelensky said of the new U.S. pledge.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused Western countries of mounting a “serious,” though ultimately unsuccessful, campaign of cyberattacks against his country.
“A true aggression has been initiated against Russia, a war in informational space,” Putin said to members of Russia’s Security Council, according to Russian state news agency Tass. “That cyberaggression against us, as well as the overall sanctions attack on Russia, has failed.”
The Kremlin has warned of reprisals against countries rallying behind Ukraine. On Friday, Finland’s state-owned natural gas wholesaler, Gasum, said Russia’s state energy company, Gazprom, had announced that it would halt supplies to the Finnish company starting Saturday.
The cutoff comes just a few days after Helsinki submitted its application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a move that ends decades of official military nonalignment and incenses Moscow. Last month, Gazprom also shut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay for the gas in rubles, which would help prop up the beleaguered Russian currency, instead of in the dollars or euros specified under contract.
Politics
President Biden met Thursday with the leaders of Finland and Sweden after both nations formally applied to join NATO this week.

Gasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen told customers that the company had “been carefully preparing for this situation” and should be able to keep the pipelines running.
With the conquest of Mariupol, Moscow now controls access to the Sea of Azov and has secured a land corridor that links the Donbas to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014.
That has had disastrous effects on Ukraine’s economy, particularly its ability to export the grain that millions of people around the world depend on for food. Officials said the loss in trade and the costs of war have contributed to a budget deficit of $5 billion. And reduced exports and rising prices for wheat have worsened food insecurity in Egypt, Pakistan and elsewhere.
At a United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday to address the crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the food supply for millions of people worldwide was being “held hostage by the Russian military” — an accusation that Russian officials dismissed as a lie. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was trying to negotiate a plan to move Ukrainian food exports out through the Black Sea.
Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, told journalists that his troops have so far managed to keep the key Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, west of Crimea, under Ukrainian control.
Ukrainian forces are also pushing southeast toward Kherson, the first city to fall after the war began Feb. 24, amid growing signs that Russia is planning to annex parts of the region, including the city of Melitopol, where the occupiers are reportedly introducing the use of the ruble in place of the Ukrainian hryvnia.
World & Nation
Russia scores its first major win with the takeover of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But will it change the course of the war?


Fears remain high for the Ukrainian soldiers captured in Mariupol. Transferred to a penal camp in Russian-controlled territory, many are severely injured and face deep hostility from Russian soldiers and politicians, who have branded the Azov regiment as “Nazis” deserving trial and punishment.
Earlier this week, the government in Kyiv said it was giving up the fight for the devastated city, but a band of diehard soldiers remained holed up in the plant.
Completing its takeover of Mariupol allows Russia to continue moving troops to the Donbas, now the focus of its offensive after its failure to capture Kyiv or the northeastern city of Kharkiv. But having been tied up so long in Mariupol and suffered losses, the forces there “must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,” which can be a lengthy process, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said in its daily assessment of the war.
The Russian military has fallen well short of Putin’s goals for his so-called special military operation in Ukraine. To try to notch more successes quickly, “Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,” the British assessment said.
The British government reported earlier that a number of senior commanders had already been relieved of their posts, including Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, whose fighters were unable to subdue Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, the head of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva last month, a stunning victory for Ukraine that was aided by U.S.-provided intelligence.
“A culture of cover-ups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system,” the British Ministry of Defense said. “Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational setbacks.”

Hello, it’s Thursday, May 19, and before the news, we’d like to shout out The Times’ “101 best California experiences,” which landed today. This is staffer Christopher Reynolds’ vast compendium of go-to spots in the Golden State, i.e. Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay (one of our personal favorites), Big Sur (for lunch at clifftop Nepenthe), and the upstairs mezzanine of L.A.’s the Last Bookstore. We asked longtime travel writer Reynolds  what made the list special:
“For me, one of the most striking things about this project was the way it showed me connections between places I’d never connected before,” he said. Such as? “Starting a century ago, Sabato Rodia spends about 30 years building his Watts Tower from whatever scraps he can get ahold of. Meanwhile, a few hundred miles to the north, Julia Morgan is designing Hearst Castle to accommodate the whims … of her rich sponsor.” These “vastly different projects,” he said, all these years later evoke “the mix of privilege and desperation, adaptation and improvisation” that underpin today’s California.
So, we invite you to take a spin through the 101.
Now, on to the stories you shouldn’t miss today.
The war in Ukraine enters a new phase as the U.S. offers Sweden security guarantees
The first Russian soldier to be tried for war crimes pleaded guilty to killing a Ukrainian civilian as fears grew over the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered in Mariupol. The uncertainty surrounding the Ukrainian fighters adds one more tense chapter to a battle that has become a focal point in the war.
Though Moscow has now won the fight for Mariupol, its long siege has emerged as a symbol of the grinding road ahead for Russia’s military. But the longer the conflict lasts, the longer the Kremlin risks entrenching its isolation and galvanizing Western allies to join together.
That was manifested when Finland and Sweden formally handed in their applications to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Plus, the U.S. is offering Sweden a number of unspecified security guarantees that could include money and weapons.

Did the Buffalo mass shooting suspect’s 90% white hometown fuel his hate?
Conklin, N.Y., has long enjoyed — even taken pride in — its speck-on-the-wall anonymity, a town unnoticed by and unconcerned with most of the outside world. But the world and its messiness landed fiercely there when one of its own allegedly killed 10 people and wounded three more in a racially motivated shooting 3 ½ hours away in Buffalo.
An avowed white supremacist, who wrote a 180-page manifesto to explain his views and the carnage they would unleash, is the son of a town that doesn’t know how to explain him.
His rage, according to police, played out in hate-filled online netherworlds populated by mostly young men who spout venom, crave attention and are becoming an increasing danger in towns like this, where extremism is seeping into the mainstream.
How a Laguna Woods church luncheon turned into a deadly scene
Behind the pulpit of the Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church was Pastor Billy Chang. He had spent two decades pastoring the Laguna Woods congregation before moving to Taiwan two years ago. And on Sunday morning, he was back as a guest preacher. In the back of the sanctuary was a stranger in a black T-shirt who read a newspaper throughout the sermon.
Chang read from the Book of Isaiah. They were prescient words. About three hours later, the parishioners would have to find that strength mentioned in the scripture to save their own lives when the stranger locked them in the auditorium and pulled out a gun.
When Dr. John Cheng — an Orange County sports medicine physician and father of two teenagers — saw the man shooting elders, he jumped into the line of fire. Cheng died at the scene. Five other parishioners were shot and taken to hospitals.
A third of the U.S. should be considering masks, officials say
Coronavirus infections are on the rise in the United States and could get even worse over the coming months, federal health officials warned as they urged the hardest-hit areas to consider reissuing calls for indoor masking.
About a third of the U.S. population lives in areas that are considered at higher risk — mostly in the Northeast and Midwest. Those are areas where people should already be considering wearing masks indoors. But Americans elsewhere should also take notice, officials said.
However, officials were cautious about making concrete predictions, saying how much worse the pandemic gets will depend on several factors, including to what degree previous infections will protect against new variants.

A ‘no party preference’ prosecutor could shake up California’s attorney general’s race
Sacramento Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert has spent three decades in courtrooms prosecuting murderers and rapists. Now she wants to be the state’s top cop. It will likely take persistence and political good fortune to succeed in the race for California attorney general as an unaffiliated, independent candidate — a campaign in which she hopes to cast off her former Republican reputation and secure one of two spots on the Nov. 8 ballot.
Schubert is running to unseat Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, the Democratic incumbent appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year as the first Filipino American to hold the job. Should she advance to November, the race could become one of the fiercest competitions of 2022, testing the political viability of both independent candidates and a tough-on-crime platform reminiscent of California campaigns from the 1990s.

The LAUSD expects enrollment to plummet by an ‘alarming’ 30% in the next decade. The predicted steep drop comes as school officials contemplate the district’s future. It could mean tough choices ahead about academic programs, campus closures, jobs and employee benefits — and could force, over that time, a dramatic remake of the nation’s second-largest school system.

Vancouver’s safe drug-use sites are wrenching to see. California should open them anyway. State legislators are considering opening safe injection sites like those pioneered in British Columbia nearly 20 years ago, both to save lives and curtail open consumption.

Ninety-four years ago today, on May 19, 1928, the first Jumping Frog Jubilee was held at Angels Camp, Calif. A 2014 Times story said the source of the tiny Gold Rush town’s “frog obsession” could be traced back to 1865, “when Mark Twain spent a few months at a nearby cabin and was inspired to write ‘The Celebrated Jumping frog of Calaveras County.’”
The contest is held each year on the third weekend in May. A couple of weeks before the inaugural event, on May 6, 1928, The Times wrote about preparations for the impending contest: “The bar-room floor of the old Angels Camp Hotel has been cleaned, scrubbed and put into shape for use as the arena, and buckshot will be strictly barred. Surrounding hills are being combed for entries in the race.” The article noted that the event would mark “the passing of the old mining camp and usher in the new era of speed” as the town had just finished paving its streets.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-16/mcdonalds-sell-its-russian-business-ukraine-war;2022-05-16;McDonald's is selling off its Russian business - Los Angeles Times;"More than three decades after it became the first American fast-food chain to open a restaurant in the Soviet Union, McDonald’s said Monday that it has started the process of selling its business in Russia, another symbol of the country’s increasing isolation over its war in Ukraine.
The company, which has 850 restaurants in Russia that employ 62,000 people, pointed to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war, saying that holding on to its business in Russia “is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald’s values.”
The Chicago-based fast-food giant had said in early March that it was temporarily closing its stores in Russia but would continue to pay its employees. Without naming a prospective Russian buyer, McDonald’s said Monday that it would seek one to hire its workers and pay them until the sale closes.
Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the “dedication and loyalty to McDonald’s” of employees and hundreds of Russian suppliers made it a difficult decision to leave.
“However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values,” Kempczinski said in a statement, “and our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there.”
As it tries to sell its restaurants, McDonald’s said it plans to start removing golden arches and other symbols and signs with the company’s name. It said it would keep its trademarks in Russia.

Ukraine has used postage stamps to boost wartime morale. One image stood out — and sold out. ‘Just felt what we all felt,’ young designer says.


Western companies have wrestled with extricating themselves from Russia, enduring the hit to their bottom lines from pausing or closing operations in the face of sanctions. Other companies have kept operating at least partially, with some facing blowback.
French carmaker Renault said Monday that it would sell its majority stake in Russian car company Avtovaz and a factory in Moscow to the state — the first major nationalization of a foreign business since the war began.

McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in Russia in the middle of Moscow more than three decades ago, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was a powerful symbol of the easing of Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Now, the company’s exit is proving symbolic of a new era, analysts say.
World & Nation
Moscow is scrambling to adjust to a new security picture in Europe brought about by its invasion of Ukraine, where fighting is ravaging the east.



“Its departure represents a new isolationism in Russia, which must now look inward for investment and consumer brand development,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a corporate analytics company.
He said McDonald’s owns most of its restaurants in Russia, but because it won’t license its brand, the sale price probably won’t be close to the value of the business before the invasion. Russia and Ukraine combined accounted for about 9% of McDonald’s revenue and 3% of operating income before the war, Saunders said.
McDonald’s said it expects to record a charge against earnings of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion related to its departure from Russia.
Its restaurants in Ukraine are closed, but the company said it is continuing to pay full salaries for its employees there.


McDonald’s has more than 39,000 locations across more than 100 countries. Most are owned by franchisees; only about 5% are owned and operated by the company.
McDonald’s said exiting Russia would not change its forecast of adding a net 1,300 restaurants this year, which are expected to contribute about 1.5% to companywide sales growth.
Last month, McDonald’s reported that it earned $1.1 billion in the first quarter, down from more than $1.5 billion a year earlier. Revenue was nearly $5.7 billion."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-22/orange-county-father-plans-trip-russia-son;2022-04-22;O.C. dad's child custody case complicated by Ukraine war - Los Angeles Times;"In a video recently posted on social media, a Russian soldier in heavy body armor holds an American passport in his hands and says it belonged to an American mercenary killed in Ukraine.
The soldier says in the video posted earlier this month on the messaging app Telegram that the mercenary is buried in a settlement outside the city of Mariupol, which Russia claimed earlier this week to have captured in its ongoing war with its neighbor.
But Orange County resident Cesar Quintana said the passport belongs to him. The Russian journalist who posted the video also posted a closeup shot of the passport that shows Quintana’s face.
Quintana, 35, said the document was confiscated by Ukrainian authorities when he was in Mariupol last year attempting to regain custody of his 2-year-old son, Alexander, who was born in the U.S.
Quintana and his estranged wife, Antonina Aslanova, are engaged in an international child custody dispute, which has been made more complicated by the war.
“I know that passport,” Quintana said in a recent interview with The Times. “It was taken from me by the Mariupol police when I was in Ukraine trying to get my son out of the country.”
Quintana said he and his wife were separated when she visited him and their son at his Aliso Viejo apartment in December 2020. He said he was recovering from gall bladder surgery and when he fell asleep, his wife took their son and fled to her home country of Ukraine.

In a Sept. 8, 2021, letter to Ukrainian authorities, the Orange County district attorney’s office says that a judge had granted Quintana sole custody of Alexander because of his wife’s “alcohol abuses.” The district attorney subsequently filed a criminal complaint against Aslanova for child abduction.
Last fall, Quintana traveled to Mariupol where Aslanova and Alexander were staying with her parents. He said the couple attempted to give Alexander some semblance of normality with family outings in Ukraine.
Quintana’s mother, Florencia Gómez, wanted to see her grandson and also made the trip to Ukraine.
“I couldn’t wait to see my grandbaby again,” Gómez said. Her nickname for Alexander is “torito,” because he’s a Taurus. She left a short time later, thinking her son and Alexander would soon follow.
Meanwhile, tensions in the region escalated as Russian troops amassed at the border with Ukraine.
During his visit, Quintana said he attempted to flee Ukraine with Alexander. He said he had a court order from a California judge showing he had legal custody.
But Mariupol police were notified by Aslanova’s family that Quintana had abducted his son and did not have permission to leave the country, Quintana said.
“That’s when they took our passports,” he said. Quintana would have to wait to be issued a new passport, but in the meantime police threatened to detain him so he returned Alexander to his mother-in-law, he said.
Quintana went back to California but he said he promised himself he would return for his son.
A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, civilian casualties have mounted as the Russian army has pounded Mariupol and other eastern cities in the Donbas region. Quintana said he planned to return to Ukraine via Poland with an aid group in March to find Aslanova and Alexander.
But before he embarked on his trip, Quintana said the State Department informed him that his wife and child had fled to Russia.
Quintana said he hasn’t had a chance to speak with Aslanova recently, but that the two messaged each other once after she arrived in Russia. He said he is relieved that Alexander is no longer in Ukraine as the war rages on but worries about his future in Russia.
“To go from thinking if he’s in Ukraine, wondering if he’s alive, and then for him to be in Russia,” Quintana said. “It’s bittersweet news.”
Aslanova told the Washington Post she and Alexander spent the early days of the Russian invasion in a Mariupol basement before they decided to flee to Russia. Aslanova told the paper that Quintana had given her permission to take Alexander, a claim he denies.
Aslanova did not respond to an email request from The Times.
Gómez worries whenever she hears about Ukraine or Russia in the news. But all she can do now is forgive her daughter-in-law for taking Alexander.
“I want to stay in a state of love, hopeful that he’ll be here,” Gómez said.
Quintana said the international custody dispute has been made even more difficult by the war. Ukraine recognizes the international treaty known as the Hague Convention on the  Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which establishes procedures to return a child to the state of their habitual residence.
But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands announced last month that it could no longer guarantee Ukrainian obligations under the treaty because of the war.
Quintana had a better chance of getting Alexander out of Ukraine but now that he is in Russia it may be near impossible, said California attorney David Lederman, who handles Hague Convention child custody cases.
“In Russia, you’ve got a country that isn’t a treaty member,” Lederman said. “You roll the dice. I don’t know Russian laws, but you’d be looking at the domestic Russian law as to whether or not there should be a return” of the child.
It does not matter if Quintana has a court order from a California judge; such orders do not have any jurisdiction in foreign countries, Lederman said.
Gómez worries about her son attempting to go to Russia to try to regain custody of Alexander. He showed her the video of the Russian soldier holding his passport.
“Sometimes, when something like that happens, you already have negative thoughts, and I was thinking, ‘Thank God that he’s here,’” she said of her son. “Imagine if he would have been in Ukraine [during the invasion]. Thank God he was here in California.”
But Quintana refuses to give up hope and continues to look for ways to bring his son back to the U.S.
“This is all I think about doing,” he said. “All I think about is bringing my son home.”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-14/ukraine-makes-gains-in-northeast-as-senior-official-warns-of-extremely-difficult-weeks-ahead;2022-05-14;Ukraine appears to make gains over Russia in Kharkiv - Los Angeles Times;"Russian troops appeared to be drawing back from the outskirts of Ukraine’s second-largest city Saturday even as fighting continued to rage in other parts of the embattled nation and senior Ukrainian officials predicted a “new, long-term phase” of conflict to last through much of the summer.
Local authorities and military officials said Russian forces were retreating from north of Kharkiv, a city that has faced relentless bombardment since the war began Feb. 24, and were heading toward the Russian border.
An analysis released by the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, supported those claims, saying Ukraine has “likely won the battle of Kharkiv.”
“Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv,” the institute said.

In the city of Izyum, 80 miles southeast of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces have launched a counteroffensive in an effort to regain more territory, officials said.
The Ukrainian gains came amid rising geopolitical tensions, as Finnish and Swedish officials risked Russia’s wrath by joining a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Saturday.
The foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland were scheduled to meet with NATO representatives in Germany after leaders of both nations expressed strong interest in joining the defense alliance.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin on a phone call Saturday that the invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed “the security environment of Finland,” which shares a more than 800-mile border with Russia, and said his country would seek NATO membership “in the next few days.”
The news has been welcomed by the U.S. and several other NATO member states, and has angered Russia, which views expansion of the alliance’s territory as a threat to its security.rity.

World & Nation
Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.

The Kremlin said Saturday that Putin had warned Niinisto that the relationship between the neighbors could be “negatively affected” if Finland applies to join NATO.
And in a sign of the economic power that Russia wields over much of Europe, on Saturday the Finnish power company Fingrid said that Russia cut off electricity supplies to the nation. A representative for the company said that Finland “can cope” and that the power grid would not be interrupted.
As Congress considers additional aid for Ukraine, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made an unannounced visit to Kyiv along with three other Republican senators, the latest in a string of high-profile U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), to have toured the Ukrainian capital in recent weeks.
The meeting was “a strong signal of bipartisan support for Ukraine from the United States Congress and the American people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Instagram. “Thank you for your leadership in helping us in our struggle not only for our country, but also for democratic values and freedoms.”


Immediate action on a bipartisan bill to give Ukraine an additional $40 billion in humanitarian and military aid has been blocked by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who said he wanted to have an inspector general scrutinize the spending.
At the same time fighting continued across Ukraine, where the first war crimes trial of a Russian soldier opened in Kyiv on Friday and Russia blamed Ukrainian shelling for the death of a civilian in a Russian village near the Ukrainian border.
Western analysts and intelligence groups said Ukraine’s mounting response to Russian assaults was showing signs of success not only in Kharkiv in the northeast but also in the Donbas, the eastern Ukrainian industrial heartland where Moscow has fomented unrest for years through its support of pro-Russia separatists.
In its daily intelligence update, the British Ministry of Defense said that Moscow’s attempt to hold a pro-Russia referendum in Kherson, a southeastern district that was the first to fall in the war, marked a failure.

Russia played a key role in Syria’s civil war. Which tactics are they reusing in Ukraine?


“A central part of Russia’s original invasion plan was highly likely to use rigged referendums to place the majority of Ukraine’s regions under long-term pro-Russian authority,” the ministry said. “The fact that Russia has only succeeded in imposing a pro-Russian local leadership in Kherson highlights the failure of Russia’s invasion to make progress towards its political objectives in Ukraine.”
Hot spots of fighting continued to include the southern city of Mariupol, Zelensky said in an overnight address. Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been evacuated from the bunkers and tunnels of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant that is Ukraine’s last holdout in the shattered southern port city on the Sea of Azov.
“We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are underway on the next stage of the evacuation mission,” Zelensky said. The president said “a large” number of individuals remained trapped in the complex, though he did not give a specific count.
He said Ukraine’s advances in the northeast should give his nation hope.
“The gradual liberation of the Kharkiv region proves that we will not leave anyone to the enemy,” Zelensky said.


Politics
Veterans of the Lincoln Project are using lessons learned in 2020 to help Ukraine combat Russian lies and misinformation.

In an interview on Sky News on Saturday, Ukrainian military intelligence leader Kyrylo Budanov said he expected battles across the nation to last through the summer and predicted, perhaps prematurely, a Ukrainian win.
“The breaking point will be in the second part of August. Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,” he said.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov offered a more cautious assessment in a post on Facebook.
“We are entering a new, long-term phase of the war,” he said. While he welcomed a growing supply of Western arms flowing into his nation, he said he expected “extremely difficult weeks” ahead, adding, “How many there will be? No one can say for sure.”
The United Nations last week estimated that more than 14 million people have been displaced by the war in Ukraine. The number represents about a third of the nation’s population.
The U.N. also reported more than 3,500 civilian deaths, though it said the real number is probably much higher.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-12/ukraine-putin-zelensky-lincoln-project-mike-madrid;2022-05-12;In Ukraine, anti-Trump strategists take on Russia and Putin - Los Angeles Times;"Over the last two decades, Mike Madrid has battled Democrats, Republicans, Donald Trump and a pesky family of squirrels that assumed residence in the eave of his Midtown Sacramento home.
His latest mission is taking on Vladimir Putin and the substructure of lies and misinformation the Russian leader built to support the invasion and attempted takeover of Ukraine.
“This is a war of the digital age, of the information age,” Madrid said via encrypted cellphone, before a meeting in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv with the Zelensky administration. “And the Ukrainians are incredibly sophisticated in the way they’re developing messaging and building infrastructure to fight back.”
Madrid, a Republican campaign consultant, has spent much of his political career tackling tough causes, including fighting within his party to broaden the GOP’s appeal to working-class and Latino voters, end the scapegoating of immigrants and stand up to the bigotry and boorishness of Trump.
(His battle with squirrel invaders, featuring the flummoxed Madrid as a real-life Elmer Fudd, racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter and turned his feed into an international clearinghouse for all things squirrel.)

World & Nation
Russian bombs wrecked a small museum holding works by one of Ukraine’s best-known artists, Maria Prymachenko. But townspeople rescued a national legacy.

The goal during a stealthy 10-day visit to Ukraine, Madrid said, was to help the country strengthen its social media presence by applying some of the lessons he and others learned in the 2020 campaign as part of the Trump-tormenting Lincoln Project.
One was the “need to use humor and humiliation against a tyrant to lessen people’s fear,” Madrid said. “It’s better to make [Putin] a clown than a devil.”

His focus at the Lincoln Project was reaching out to persuadable voters in key portions of battleground states. TV advertising and viral videos were the most attention-grabbing (and lucrative) aspect of the group’s strategy. Madrid’s efforts were surgical strikes aimed at undermining Trump and helping Joe Biden by harnessing information to analytics.
He placed digital advertisements, one after another, and then gauged their effect in real time, using a series of metrics — shares, likes, time spent watching — to determine which messages performed best. It was a master class in online engagement.
Soon after the election, Madrid left the Lincoln Project. The departure followed an acrimonious split with some of its founders, who faced allegations involving sexual harassment and financial self-dealing.
Despite that unhappy ending, Madrid’s connection to the insurgent effort led in roundabout fashion to Ukraine. A filmmaker and specialist in information warfare, who is producing a Lincoln Project documentary, introduced Madrid and Ron Steslow, a fellow Lincoln Project alum and host of the Politicology podcast, to Ukrainians fighting Russia online.
Earlier this month the two traveled to Ukraine, accompanied by a Russian information specialist — unnamed here for safety reasons — to help wage war against Putin on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.
The three met furtively with academics and political activists. They huddled with cyberwarriors and senior members of Zelensky’s administration. They shared ideas on targeting audiences to counteract Putin’s propaganda, ways to penetrate Russia’s closed society to tell the true story of the invasion, and methods of engaging millions of pro-democracy allies around the world.
They came away impressed with the expertise of the resistance and the fortitude and determination of those in its ranks.
“The Ukrainians know their history,” Madrid said. “They will all die before letting Russia take their land. They know what the Russians will do to them. Look at Bucha and Irpin,” cities where Ukrainians say hundreds of civilians were massacred. “They know.”

Madrid spoke from a hillside outside Lviv, overlooking a series of small plots where farmers were putting down seed. It was a quiet break from air-raid sirens, roadside checkpoints and hushed meetings in darkened apartments. A patchy phone connection faded in and out.
For more than a decade, he noted, Russia has been waging cyberwar on Ukraine, the United States and other countries. After interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign, to the benefit of Trump, Putin and his troll farms continue to flood social media with content aimed at dividing Americans over politics, race, pandemic restrictions and other issues.
Fighting back will require new alliances across political parties and national borders, said Madrid, who started flying home Wednesday.
“We all agreed,” he said of his newfound compatriots, “this will be the future of cyberwarfare. ... Networking to bring down regimes that threaten the rise of authoritarianism. Ukraine has built the infrastructure for what that looks like.”
Now, he said, it’s up to others around the world to expand and build on those pro-democracy efforts."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-02/israel-slams-russian-comments-nazism-antisemitism-ukraine;2022-05-02;Israel slams Russia over remarks on Nazism and Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Israel on Monday lashed out at Russia over “unforgivable” comments by its foreign minister about Nazism and antisemitism, including claims that Hitler was Jewish and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s Jewish origins do not mean his country can’t harbor Nazi elements.
Israel, which summoned the Russian ambassador in response to the remarks by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said such comments blamed Jews for their own murder in the Holocaust.
It was a sharp setback to ties between the two countries at a time when Israel has sought to stake out a neutral position between Russia and Ukraine and remain in Moscow’s good books for its security needs in the Middle East.
Asked in an interview with an Italian news channel about Russian claims that it invaded Ukraine to “de-Nazify” the country, Lavrov said that Ukraine could still have Nazi elements even if some figures, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, are Jewish.
“So when they say, ‘How can Nazification exist if we’re Jewish?’, in my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn’t mean absolutely anything. For some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish,” he said, speaking to the station in Russian, dubbed over by an Italian translation.
In some of the harshest remarks since the start of the war in Ukraine, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called Lavrov’s statement “unforgivable and scandalous and a horrible historical error.”
World & Nation
In a rapidly growing wave, thousands of Ukrainian Jews have fled to Israel.

“The Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust,” said Lapid, the son of a Holocaust survivor. “The lowest level of racism against Jews is to blame Jews themselves for antisemitism.”

Lapid later said Israel makes “every effort” to have good relations with Russia. “But there’s a limit and this limit has been crossed this time. The government of Russia needs to apologize to us and to the Jewish people,” he said.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has been more measured in his criticism of Russia’s invasion, also condemned Lavrov’s comments.
“His words are untrue and their intentions are wrong,” he said. “Using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately.”
World & Nation
Vladimir Putin paints his enemies in Ukraine as ‘neo-Nazis’ even though the president is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust.

Israel’s Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, called the remarks “absurd, delusional, dangerous and deserving of condemnation.”
“Lavrov is propagating the inversion of the Holocaust — turning the victims into the criminals on the basis of promoting a completely unfounded claim that Hitler was of Jewish descent,” it said in a statement. “Equally serious is calling the Ukrainians in general, and President Zelensky in particular, Nazis. This, among other things, is a complete distortion of the history and an affront to the victims of Nazism.”
In Germany, government spokesman Steffen Hebstreit said the Russian government’s “propaganda” efforts weren’t worthy of comment, calling them “absurd.”
Nazism has featured prominently in Russia’s war aims and narrative as it fights in Ukraine. In his bid to justify the war to his people, President Vladimir Putin has portrayed the battle as a struggle against Nazis in Ukraine, even though the country has a democratically elected government and a Jewish president whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust.
Ukraine also condemned Lavrov’s remarks.
World & Nation
A Holocaust survivor, killed by a missile strike on his apartment, is buried amid the devastation of the war in Ukraine.


“By trying to rewrite history, Moscow is simply looking for arguments to justify the mass murders of Ukrainians,” Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov’s remarks exposed the “deeply rooted antisemitism of the Russian elites.”
World War II, in which the Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people and helped defeat Nazi Germany, is a linchpin of Russian national identity. Repeatedly reaching for the historical narrative that places Russia as a savior against evil forces has helped the Kremlin rally Russians around the war.
In the Middle East, Russia has a military presence in Syria, and Israel, which carries out frequent strikes on enemy targets in the country, relies on Russia for security coordination to prevent their forces from coming into conflict with one another. That has forced Israel to tread lightly in its criticism of the war in Ukraine.
While it has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and expressed support for its people, Israel has been measured in its criticism of Russia. It has not joined international sanctions against Russia or provided military aid to Ukraine.
That paved the way for Bennett to be able to try to mediate between the sides, an effort which appears to have stalled as Israel deals with its own internal unrest.
The invocation of the Holocaust in the Ukraine war has also sparked Israeli anger toward Kyiv.
In a speech to Israeli legislators in March, Zelensky compared Russia’s invasion of his country to the actions of Nazi Germany, accusing Putin of trying to carry out a “final solution” in Ukraine. The comparison drew an angry condemnation from Yad Vashem, which said Zelensky was trivializing the Holocaust."

The measure sailed to passage by a lopsided 368-57 margin, providing $7 billion more than Biden’s request from April and dividing the increase evenly between defense and humanitarian programs. The bill would give Ukraine military and economic assistance, help regional allies, replenish weapons the Pentagon has shipped overseas and provide $5 billion to address global food shortages caused by the war’s crippling of Ukraine’s normally robust production of many crops.
The measure was backed by every voting Democrat and by nearly 3 out of 4 Republicans. House debate reflected a perspective, shared broadly by both parties, that the U.S. has even more at stake than standing by Ukraine.
“The Ukrainian people, they need us, they are in desperate need of our support,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. “Vladimir Putin and his cronies must be held responsible. This bill does that by protecting democracy, limiting Russian aggression and strengthening our own national security.”
“As China, Iran and North Korea watch our response, we must show the world that America stands firm with its allies and will do what is necessary to protect our interests abroad,” said Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
The new legislation would bring American support for the effort to nearly $54 billion, including the $13.6 billion in support Congress enacted in March. That’s about $6 billion more than the U.S. spent on all its foreign and military aid in 2019, according to a January report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which studies issues for lawmakers. It’s also about 1% of the entire federal budget.
The measure was released as Washington has become increasingly assertive about its goals and its willingness to help Ukraine with more sophisticated weapons. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said recently the U.S. wants a “weakened” Russia that can’t quickly restore its capability to attack other countries.
Russian attacks on Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa have intensified in what seems an attempt to hamper deliveries of Western arms. Those weapons have helped Ukraine hold its own surprisingly well against its more lethal foe, but the grinding war is taking its toll.

World & Nation
The Russian leader stops short of calling for a wider war mobilization during an annual military parade but vows to capture Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Senate approval of Ukrainian aid seems certain, and members of both parties have echoed the need for quick action. “As Putin desperately accelerates his campaign of horror and brutality in Ukraine, time is of the essence,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
But it was unclear when the Senate would act, and changes there were possible, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) insisting that the measure be narrowly focused on the war.
“I think we’re on a path to getting that done,” McConnell told reporters. “It needs to be clean of extraneous matters, directly related to helping the Ukrainians win the war.”
Some Republicans used the election season debate to accuse Biden of being unclear about his goals.
“Honestly, do we not deserve a plan?” said Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas). He said he agrees that Western countries must help Ukraine stand up to Russia but added, “Does the administration not need to come to us with where we are going with this?”
Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., attended Tuesday’s separate Democratic and Republican Senate lunches and expressed gratitude for the support they’ve received. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Markarova told them her country has depleted its stockpiles of Soviet-era weapons and said continued NATO support is vital.
Coons said the Ukrainian’s message was: “Thank you, do more. We have a hard fight ahead. With your support, we can win.”

As many as 60 people are feared dead at a school in Ukraine. Zelensky compares the fight against Russia to World War II battle against Nazi Germany.


The new measure includes $6 billion to arm and train Ukrainian forces, $8.7 billion to restore American stores of weapons shipped to Ukraine and $3.9 billion for U.S. forces deployed to the area.
There’s also $8.8 billion in economic support for Ukraine, $4 billion to help Ukraine and allies finance arms and equipment purchases and $900 million for housing, education and other help for Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.
To enhance the measure’s chances in Congress, the House bill dropped Biden’s proposal to ease the pathway to legal permanent residency for qualifying Afghans who fled to the U.S. after last summer’s American withdrawal from that country. Some Republicans have expressed concerns about the adequacy of security screenings for applicants.
In their biggest concession, Biden and Democrats abandoned plans Monday to include additional billions of dollars to build up U.S. supplies of medicines, vaccines and tests for COVID-19. Republican support for more pandemic spending is waning and including that money would have slowed the Ukraine measure in the 50-50 Senate, where at least 10 GOP votes will be needed for passage.
Democrats hope to produce a separate COVID-19 package soon, though its fate is unclear.
Biden met in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday with Pelosi and six other House Democrats who traveled recently to Ukraine and Poland. Afterward, Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a member of that delegation and a former Army Ranger, said the Ukrainians need advanced drones and longer-range weapons like artillery, rockets and anti-ship missiles that will help them push back the Russians."

But the Russian leader stopped short of using the occasion — known as Victory Day to mark the defeat of Adolf Hitler’s forces 77 years ago — to declare an all-out war with Ukraine, as some analysts feared he would. Russia still refers to the invasion as a “special military operation,” which does not require a full national mobilization of resources for war.
Standing in front of decorated veterans in Red Square, Putin characterized Russia as having had no choice but to strike back against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the West’s refusal to provide Moscow with security guarantees.
“The danger was rising by the day,” Putin said. “Russia has given a preemptive response to an aggression.”


The parade, which included a display of military equipment, marching soldiers and a martial band, came as Western nations imposed more sanctions on Russia’s hobbled economy and moved to boost Ukraine’s defenses.
President Biden signed a law designed to speed up shipments of arms to Ukraine. Known as the Lend-Lease Act, it dates back to World War II and President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s efforts to make the United States the “arsenal of democracy.”
Also Monday, U.S. Commerce Department said it was suspending a 25% tax on steel imported from Ukraine — which was imposed in 2018 by the Trump administration — to help the country’s beleaguered economy.
Those efforts come as the U.S. Congress is poised to approve $40 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, much more than the $33 billion package Biden requested.

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.


In counter-programming of sorts to the Kremlin’s display, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared that his nation would emerge victorious from the fight against its behemoth neighbor.
“We are fighting for our children’s freedom and therefore we will win,” Zelensky said in a video address Monday while striding in daylight down a major Kyiv thoroughfare, with stately buildings and antitank “hedgehogs” fashioned from fused I-beams visible in the background. “Very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And someone won’t have any.”
Ukrainian military officials and  Western analysts said that Russia’s offensive in the eastern industrial heartland appeared stalled. At the same time, Russian forces have continued to inflict deadly harm on civilians.
A day after Zelensky reported that about 60 civilians were killed in the weekend bombing of a school in the village of Bilohorivka, in contested Luhansk province in the east, air-raid alerts sounded in cities and towns across the country Monday.
Officials pleaded with the public to take heed and find shelter as the Ukrainian military warned of a “high probability” of missile strikes throughout the country as Russia used Victory Day as an impetus for a reinvigorated assault.

Three Ukrainians have found refuge, and a way to share the recipes of their homeland, in a fancy Paris restaurant.






Throughout the 10-week-old Russian offensive, schools — which often serve as bomb shelters — have been vulnerable to attack. Ukrainian officials said that in the course of the war, more than 1,600 educational institutions had been damaged by bombardment, 126 of them destroyed.
Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, was among officials who appealed for special caution Monday, citing the possibility of more “terrible” events.
“Today we do not know what to expect from the enemy,” Haidai wrote on Telegram. “Please go out onto the street as little as possible. Stay in shelters.”
Haidai said shelling in the village of Shypylivka the day before had left 11 people trapped under the rubble of a two-story building.


In Kyiv’s city center, where traffic was light but a few establishments remained open, IT worker Tanya Melnyk said she hadn’t been taking any special precautions in connection with the Russian holiday. Still, she felt on edge.
“It’s constant stress anyway,” the 34-year-old said. “Maybe I’m staying home more during these few days, but I’m not sure it makes me feel any safer.”
Putin was more measured in his speech than some had expected, perhaps out of wariness that either declaring victory in Ukraine or escalating the conflict would send the wrong message.
Allyson Edwards, an expert on Russian militarism at Britain’s University of Warwick, said the speech was purposefully “underwhelming” to give him more flexibility in handling the war, which has dragged on far longer than he probably thought it would and forced him to re-strategize, such as withdrawing troops from around Kyiv.

“Stating victory would make people question, why is the special military operation still happening then?” she said. “And war mobilization would show Putin’s failure to be able to bring about victory within the confines of the special military operation. He’s keeping it vague, justifying his goals along the lines of Western humiliation of Russia, notions that NATO was planning a punitive operation in Donbas and the duty of Russia to fight Nazism as their great-grandfathers did in the 1940s.”
Putin said Russian soldiers in Ukraine were “fighting for the motherland, so that no one will forget the lessons of World War II and there will be no place in the world for hangmen, executioners and the Nazis.”
Moscow falsely insists that Ukraine’s leadership is riddled with neo-Nazis — even though Zelensky is Jewish — who are intent on cleansing the country of ethnic Russians, particularly in the eastern region of Donbas. Putin referred to the area as part of Russia’s “historic lands,” in keeping with his embrace of a “Greater Russia” ideology encompassing much of the former Soviet Union’s territory.
In Warsaw, Russia’s ambassador to Poland, Sergey Andreev, was doused with what appeared to be red paint thrown by protesters as he visited a cemetery to honor Soviet soldiers who died during World War II. The protesters carried Ukrainian flags and were also covered in red coloring to symbolize those who have died at the hands of Russian forces.

Meanwhile, all indications suggested that the front lines of the war remained mostly static.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invited U2 frontman Bono and the Edge to perform a mini-concert in Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian military said in a morning operational report that it had repelled half a dozen attacks in the previous 24 hours in Luhansk and Donetsk, the two provinces making up the Donbas region that Russia is trying to overrun completely.
Ukrainian forces pressed ahead with a counteroffensive outside the northeastern city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border, the military said. That push has been forcing Moscow to divert troops from elsewhere, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in its latest battlefield assessment.
Ukrainian military pressure has been bolstered by growing Western diplomatic support.
On Monday, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, became the latest Western dignitary to travel to Ukraine, touring the historic city of Odesa, which has come under increasing fire from Russian forces. The city is home to a commercially vital port on the Black Sea from which Ukraine dispatches much of its grain — exports that countries the world over rely upon.
“I saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn ready for export,” Michel wrote on Twitter. “This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black sea ports. Causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries. We need a global response.”
The Commerce Department’s suspension of the import tax on Ukrainian steel was aimed at reactivating one of the country’s most important industries.
Some of Ukraine’s biggest steel-producing communities have been hard hit by the war, including Mariupol, where a small regiment of Ukrainian fighters has been holed up in  tunnels beneath a steel plant that has faced regular bombardments from Russia.
“We can’t just admire the fortitude and spirit of the Ukrainian people — we need to have their backs and support one of the most important industries to Ukraine’s economic well-being,” Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo said Monday. “For steel mills to continue as an economic lifeline for the people of Ukraine, they must be able to export their steel.’’

Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.

Michel’s trip to Ukraine followed visits Sunday by First Lady Jill Biden to a western Ukrainian town near the border with Slovakia and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Kyiv.
On the same day, the Group of 7 top industrialized countries — the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy — announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s industrial sector, state-controlled media, and Russian and Belarusian finance executives from major banks, including Russia’s Gazprombank.

The onslaught came even as Western and Ukrainian military officials and analysts said Moscow’s much vaunted military offensive in the country’s industrial heartland was being slowed by troop casualties and logistical, supply and morale problems.
And in Mariupol, the southern port city that has become ground zero in Russian brutality and Ukrainian resistance, a small group of women and children was finally evacuated Saturday from a besieged steel plant, but hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians, soldiers and wounded remained trapped.
Russia reported nearly 400 artillery strikes over-night and early Saturday, mainly in the eastern battle zone. It described the targets as military ones, but Ukraine says residential areas, including the northeastern city of Kharkiv, are being ravaged. Ukrainian officials said that among the targets hit Saturday was the airport in Odesa, considered the jewel of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Damage to fuel depots was causing severe gasoline and energy shortages, the officials said.
At the same time, the Kremlin redoubled efforts to blame the West for the devastating war that is now in its third month. The Russian invasion has killed thousands of people, left whole swaths of cities in ruins, and turned more than 5.4 million people into refugees.
Moscow’s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, was quoted Saturday as saying that a flood of weaponry from North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies was “pumping up” the battle. But at the same time, in remarks to official Chinese media that were reported on the ministry’s website, Lavrov insisted that Washington and its European allies were “absolutely indifferent” to Ukraine’s fate. The Pentagon revealed last week that U.S. military personnel are training Ukrainians in Germany in the use of artillery, radar systems and armored vehicles, all being supplied to Ukraine by Washington and allies.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an overnight video address to the nation early Saturday, accused Russia of scorched-earth tactics in two large eastern provinces known together as the Donbas, where the fighting is concentrated. Moscow already had a foothold in two small separatist statelets before the war, but is seeking to seize the entire region.
“Russia wants to make this area uninhabited,” Zelensky said, citing “constant brutal bombings” targeting infrastructure and civilian-populated areas.

Late Saturday night, he spoke again, switching to Russian to urge Russia’s soldiers not to fight.
“Every Russian soldier can still save his own life. It’s better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our land,” Zelensky said.


World & Nation
A series of factors helped pave the way for former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed’s release this week as part of a prisoner exchange, at an unlikely time in Washington-Moscow relations.

Zelensky said that Russia’s determination to wipe out Ukraine is nowhere clearer than in Mariupol, the besieged port city that he described as a “Russian concentration camp” among the ruins.
Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in Mariupol more than a week ago, saying Moscow’s forces control the city, but Ukrainian forces and civilians remain holed up in a giant steelworks complex amid increasingly desperate conditions. Russia is blockading and bombarding the sprawling compound, from which black smoke could be seen rising on Saturday.
Videos posted from inside the warren of tunnels and bunkers under the plant have shown ill and injured women and elderly people, distressed-looking children, and infants wearing diapers fashioned from plastic garbage bags. Online videos also showed gruesome untreated injuries suffered by some troops defending the plant.
Ukrainian authorities were trying to arrange civilian evacuations Saturday from Mariupol and other particularly dangerous parts of the battle zone, but such efforts have repeatedly broken down, with Russian troops accused of firing on those fleeing.
The mayor of the eastern town of Popasna said Saturday that a day earlier, two buses on their way to ferry evacuees had come under fire, and contact with the drivers had been lost. Later Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, a regional leader in the eastern Luhansk area, said one of the buses was recovered. It had been hit by grenade fire and contained blood but no bodies, he said.
European governments have repeatedly signaled concern over the deteriorating conditions for civilians in the east, particularly in Mariupol. On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron, who handily won reelection last weekend, told Zelensky by phone that France would increase military and humanitarian assistance, Macron’s office said.
Zelensky later Saturday also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who similarly promised more military aid and to work on evacuations from Mariupol, according to Johnson’s office.
Russian and Ukrainian reports both said between 20 and 25 people finally made it out of Mariupol. The Ukrainian military said they were en route to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Russia, however, has frequently forced evacuees from various towns into Russia, Russian-held territory or Russian ally Belarus.
Ukrainian authorities and international investigators, meanwhile, continued to make grisly discoveries in areas occupied by Russia earlier in the war, where extensive evidence of atrocities against civilians has already come to light. In a village near the commuter town of Bucha, close to the capital, Kyiv, police unearthed the bodies of three more men, apparently civilians, wearing blindfolds and with hands bound.
The chief of Kyiv’s regional police, Andrii Niebytov, said in a video Saturday that the corpses, recovered a day earlier, bore signs of torture, and that all three men had been shot in the head, with entry wounds in their ears.
Hundreds of war crimes investigations are being launched across the country, primarily conducted by Ukrainian officials but with added assistance from the International Criminal Court, Britain and the United States. President Biden has already labeled Putin a war criminal.
As fighting raged, the latest conflict assessment from British military intelligence, released early Saturday, depicted Russian forces as facing some of the same difficulties that prompted Moscow to break off an earlier bid to seize Kyiv.

Despite Russia’s steps to improve its battlefield prospects in the east — massing troops and firepower, streamlining command and control, and fashioning shorter supply lines — its forces still face “considerable challenges,” the British assessment said.
The Russian military command is merging and redeploying “depleted and disparate units from the failed advances” in the country’s northeast, the report said, adding that many of these units were probably suffering from poor morale. It also cited inconsistent air support and a “lack of unit-level skills.”
Another new analysis, from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, or ISW, said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing” Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine. Moscow’s forces made limited advances west of the city of Severodonetsk, the analysis said, but remained “stalled” at a strategic bottleneck, south of the city of Izyum.
Both assessments echoed observations made by the Pentagon, where a senior official said Russia’s push south from Izyum was gaining only “a few kilometers” a day.
Western analysts have suggested nimble battlefield tactics could help Ukrainians inflict significant losses on the Russians, as they did when Kyiv was under threat. The front lines are fluid in places, with Ukrainian forces “conducting a maneuver defense rather than holding static positions,” the ISW assessment said.
Neither side has made a practice of regularly releasing updated information about battlefield deaths. Ukraine has been somewhat more forthcoming, acknowledging a significant number of dead and wounded among its troops. However, Zelensky advisor Oleksiy Arestovych on Friday described Russian losses as “colossal.”
World & Nation
Ukrainian authorities are cracking down on anyone suspected of aiding Russian troops under laws enacted by Ukraine’s parliament and signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky after the Feb. 24 invasion.
In an apparent effort to avoid further troop losses, Russia has been aiming withering artillery fire all across the east. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry on Saturday reported hitting 389 targets, saying those included troop concentrations, weapons caches and crucial fuel depots.
Ukraine has acknowledged that hits on fuel depots and refineries are causing a fuel crunch. Long lines of cars and trucks have been forming at gas stations in various parts of the country.
Zelensky said in his overnight address that stepped-up shipments from allies and other measures were expected to ease the shortages in the next week or two, but Ukrainian officials in the meantime asked citizens to avoid unnecessary travel in private vehicles.
“Remember the needs of the army,” exhorted an official Ukrainian government communique on the Telegram messaging app.
In the strike on Odesa, which remains in Ukrainian hands after being menaced earlier in the war, local officials said the airport’s main runway was rendered unusable.
In Lviv near the Polish border, a celebrity sighting gave a brief respite from the anxiety of war and spurred a social media flurry. Angelina Jolie, the American actor, was spotted at a coffee shop, Lviv Croissants, on Saturday afternoon. Videos and photographs on social media showed her signing a few autographs and posing with Ukrainian patrons of the shop and later meeting with children.
Jolie has served as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations refugee agency and visited refugees from other conflicts elsewhere in the world.
But a spokesman for the organization, Chris Boian, said by telephone that Jolie was in Ukraine “totally on her own initiative” and that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was not involved.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-08/russia-victory-day-may-9-ukraine-military-strategy;2022-05-08;Op-Ed: Where will Putin steer the Ukraine war on Russia's Victory Day? - Los Angeles Times;"May 9 marks a pivotal date in Russian history and has long been important in its politics. Known as Victory Day, it is used by Russian leaders to celebrate victory over Nazi Germany by holding large military parades and nationalist ceremonies.
It’s not surprising that this year the Kremlin is using the day’s heavy symbolism to promote its savage war against Ukraine — which it has monstrously and falsely justified is a “denazification” campaign.
The war in Ukraine is at a critical juncture. Russia continues to attack along the eastern front despite estimated losses as high as 20% of its combat-ready ground forces in Ukraine. Russia also faces the risk of defections from its elite ranks. For weeks now, Moscow has launched missile attacks against Ukrainian lines of communication, hitting rail lines, warehouses and critical infrastructure to reduce the ability of Kyiv to push foreign military supplies forward and to sustain its defenses in the east and south.
Opinion
U.S. military, intelligence, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine must keep flowing and even increase as the Russian invasion enters a new phase.

On the other side, against all odds, it looks like the Ukrainian people — with the help of a coalition of democratic nations and volunteers — are holding their own against Russian troops.
But what comes next? The answer rests on how Moscow and an increasingly isolated, paranoid and risk-taking group of Russian elites surrounding President Vladimir Putin approach Monday’s holiday.
Here are three possible paths forward in the struggle for Ukraine:
First, Putin and his generals could use Victory Day to declare what’s known as a Potemkin peace: claim victory while pulling back to lines of control that roughly match territory that Russia controlled in Ukraine in 2014, including its annexation of Crimea that year. Russia has a long history of using Potemkin villages — elaborate facades to hide uncomfortable truths — that could serve as a foundation for a new lie: victory in Ukraine.

The shooting would stop along the front line and Russia would proclaim independent states in the east and around Kherson, a city in south Ukraine.  There would probably be  periodic shelling along a contact line and a continuing lower-intensity conflict. Sanctions would remain in place, and while the West helped rebuild Ukraine, Moscow would focus on rebuilding its army and insulating its economy, for a future military operation. This pattern reflects a sad truth from international relations: The most likely source of conflict is past conflict. Many wars never end: They hibernate only to perpetually return, creating patterns of protracted conflict and enduring rivalry.
Second, Putin and his generals could declare martial law and conduct a total mobilization of the Russian state and society for war. This is the most dangerous path. Putin has denied that he will officially declare war on Monday, but that could change. A formal declaration of war would end any prospect of a rapprochement with the West, with  Moscow showing that it’s willing to fight a long, costly war likely to further threaten bordering European states. Putin could even be pulled to expand the conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders.
There are already signs this dark future may be upon us. There are reports of a mass mobilization being discussed in Russia. The Kremlin is moving to escalate its economic war with the West, including breaking existing contracts for energy exports and denying strategic resources to countries helping Ukraine.

Even a  mass mobilization, however, wouldn’t mean an immediate escalation in fighting. It would take time for Russia to train new recruits, build units and move them to Ukraine.  Russia would suffer  economically by putting money into its troop expansion and cutting business ties with the West. In this scenario, the open question then is what China, Iran and India would do. If Russia can align its trade and financial system to these Asian countries, then Russia can sustain a long war.

Here the history of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s provides insights. Tehran was cut off from the world, while Baghdad received  significant foreign financial and military support. Yet Iran was able to mobilize troops that conducted human-wave attacks,  in which large masses charge toward the enemy at once, and fought Iraq to a bloody stalemate for more than eight years.
Third, Russia could stay the course, continuing what has essentially become a stalled offense. In this scenario, the Russian military would order  the units already in Ukraine, which are suffering from high attrition levels, to attempt to seize more territory in the east using current tactics. While making some territorial gains might achieve a symbolic tactical victory for Russia, it would set the stage for a large-scale Ukrainian counterattack.
At present, Russia’s ability to find gaps in Ukraine’s defensive line in the east has proved limited, raising the risk that Kyiv could counterattack. If Ukraine can isolate Russian forces, it creates the possibility of mass surrenders, a common outcome seen historically when militaries employ the blitzkrieg and kesselschlacht strategies to encircle the enemy. But even  this outcome is unlikely to end the war, because  Russia still retains  its nuclear arsenal and long-range missiles that it could potentially employ.
The tragedy is that any of these paths — Potemkin peace, long-attritional struggle or a Ukrainian counterattack —  means that this war is not likely to end soon.
Cease-fires don’t guarantee peace. The only people who can stop this war are the Russians. But Putin has locked up Russian citizens for questioning the war. While Western nations hope sanctions will turn Russian elites against the Kremlin, no cracks in the regime have emerged. This political reality sets the stage for a long, brutal struggle that will require continued support for Ukraine and increased diplomatic efforts to keep Moscow isolated.

The G-7 countries — including Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy — also vowed to phase out or ban the import of Russian oil, a move that European leaders have so far resisted but that was proposed by the European Union last week. The U.S. has already banned the import of Russian oil, gas and coal as a result of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine that began in late February.

As many as 60 people are feared dead at a school in Ukraine. Zelensky compares the fight against Russia to World War II battle against Nazi Germany.

The announcement came as President Biden held virtual talks with G-7 leaders along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the eve of Russia’s Victory Day, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.
In a statement following the call, which lasted roughly an hour, G-7 leaders said they assured Zelensky of “our full solidarity and support,” pledging additional assistance since the beginning of the war of more than $24 billion for 2022.
“In the coming weeks, we will step up our collective short-term financial support to help Ukraine close financing gaps and deliver basic services to its people, while also developing options — working with the Ukrainian authorities and international financial institutions — to support long-term recovery and reconstruction,” the statement read.
The latest sanctions also prohibit Western professional service groups, including international management consulting and accounting firms  such as Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, from doing business with any individual in the Russian Federation. U.S. officials believe some of these groups have been asked to help Russian companies reformulate their business strategies to evade sanctions or conceal their wealth, a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the announcement. The ban, however, does not extend to legal services.
“We picked goods, we picked services, we’ve picked technologies that we and the Europeans and the G-7, and our partners in Asia, were the dominant suppliers of and we don’t think Russia has many options other than to try to produce these goods and services domestically, which I think will be a very tall task,” the official said.

In an effort to blunt Russian Vladimir Putin’s war propaganda at home, the Biden administration is leveling sanctions against the country’s three biggest television stations, blocking Channel One Russia, Russia-1 and NTV Broadcasting Company from receiving U.S. advertising dollars, broadcast technology, video cameras, microphones and other equipment.
The administration is also extending export controls on wood products, industrial engines, bulldozers, boilers and other equipment in tandem with European controls on chemicals to limit Russia’s access to components needed to restock military capabilities.
Promtekhnologiya, which produces rifles and weapons used in Ukraine’s invasion, seven shipping companies and one marine towing company were also hit with sanctions. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will also halt general licenses for exports of source material, special material, byproduct material and deuterium to Russia.
The U.S. is adding about 2,600 visa restrictions on Russian and Belarusian officials as well as eight executives from Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institution, and 27 executives from Gazprombank, which plays a key role in facilitating payments for Russian oil and gas exports to Europe, and Moscow Industrial Bank and its 10 subsidiaries.
The official emphasized the sanctions extend only to Gazprombank’s top executives and do not represent a full block on the Russian energy giant. The administration has been cautious about shutting down Gazprombank’s operations while Europe is still importing gas from Russia, the official added.
The announcement comes two days after Biden unveiled  an additional $150-million weapons package including 25,000 155-millimeter  artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars and electronic jamming equipment. The president has urged Congress to approve $33 billion in aid for Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing assault, as the remaining $250 million in the presidential drawdown authority dwindles.
The funding request, more than double the $13.6 billion that lawmakers approved last month, signals a significant ramp-up of the administration’s long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine.
The G-7 leaders said they remained united in their resolve to deny Putin a victory in Ukraine. “We owe it to the memory of all those who fought for freedom in the Second World War, to continue fighting for it today, for the people of Ukraine, Europe and the global community,” the G-7 statement read."

Putin, in a message released by the Kremlin on Thursday, offered his support to Leonid Pasechnik, the head of pro-Russia separatists in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, part of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
“I am sure that through our joint efforts we will defend the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity” of the Luhansk republic, Putin said, as his war on Ukraine began its 12th week.
The Russian leader’s message was backed by a torrent of Russian airstrikes and artillery barrages along the 300-mile-long eastern battlefront, including on a steel mill where the last pocket of Ukrainian military resistance remains in the strategic southeastern port city of Mariupol.

Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.

The fighting came amid the dramatic announcement by Finland’s president and prime minister of their support for joining NATO, paving the way for an expansion of the U.S.-led military alliance that Putin partially blamed for his decision to invade Ukraine.
Finland, a historically neutral country that shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, is expected to be joined soon by Sweden in seeking membership in the 30-member security pact.
“NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security,” President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint statement Thursday. “As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay.”

Kremlin officials warned that they saw Finland’s move to join NATO as a threat. “Another expansion of NATO does not make our continent more stable and secure,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency. Joining NATO would make Finland “part of the enemy” and “a target — or a possible target — for a strike,” the deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said in an interview.

The addition of the two Nordic states to NATO would underscore how badly Putin has miscalculated the world’s response to his invasion of Ukraine, which has failed to achieve its initial military objectives, prompted Europe to begin weaning itself off Russia’s most valuable export — fossil fuels — and compelled nonaligned states to pick sides.
“This is monumental,” said Aglaya Snetkov, a Russia expert and lecturer in international politics at University College London. “This reverses decades of foreign policy.
“Putin’s initial plan of drawing a line in the sand between Russia and NATO and reversing the latter’s expansion has spectacularly backfired,” she added. “This is precisely what Russia did not want: NATO expansion.”

Russian bombs wrecked a small museum holding works by one of Ukraine’s best-known artists, Maria Prymachenko. But townspeople rescued a national legacy.


The Kremlin responded by saying that Putin had already set in motion a strengthening of Russian defenses along its western flank.
But Snetkov said Moscow would probably struggle to mount a significant response if Finland and Sweden joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, given the vast deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine.
“It is bogged down in Ukraine, has pulled its troops from its other borders,” Snetkov said of Russia. “Realistically, what can it do? If it doesn’t respond, which I think is likely, this shows yet again the weakness of Russia and that it’s full of empty threats.”
More than a dozen Russian armored vehicles were destroyed crossing the Seversky Donets River near the village of Bilohorivka in Luhansk, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, which posted pictures on Facebook of charred tanks and the remnants of two pontoon bridges. The photos could not be independently verified.
The village was the target of a Russian strike over the weekend that hit a school-turned-shelter, killing about 60 civilians, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, its troops have destroyed 570 healthcare facilities and 101 hospitals, Zelensky said in his nightly address to his nation.
“Russia’s strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them,” Zelensky said. “Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes.”

Ukraine says it has driven back Russian troops around Kharkiv as U.S intelligence officials warn that Moscow is preparing for a protracted war.

The Ukrainian military said Thursday morning that it had repulsed nine Russian attacks over the last 24 hours in Luhansk and Donetsk, while admitting that Russian advances in the region had achieved “partial success.” Four Ukrainian civilians were reported dead and five more were injured in the Donetsk region, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.
“All Russians will be held accountable for their crimes!” Kyrylenko posted on the app Telegram.
Russian airstrikes continued to rain down on the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, where the city’s last defenders have been holed up for weeks. The dire situation prompted Kyiv to offer the release of Russian prisoners of war in exchange for the safe evacuation of injured soldiers trapped inside the southern port city’s mill.
Negotiations were ongoing Thursday, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, but none of the options discussed so far was “ideal.”


The defenders, members of the Azov regiment, have refused to surrender despite heavy bombardment and quickly depleting sources of food, water and medicine.
Only a fraction of Mariupol’s 400,000 residents are believed to remain in the shattered city, which Mayor Vadym Boychenko said was reduced to a “medieval ghetto.”
Many of the city’s evacuees have fled about 120 miles northwest to the town of Zaporizhzhia, which was hit by Russian shells and grenades, the Ukrainian military said Thursday.
More than 8 million people are now displaced within Ukraine, with nearly half fleeing homes in the country’s east, according to the International Organization for Migration.
Meanwhile, more than 6 million have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Ukraine’s human rights chief alleged that about 3,000 Mariupol residents were being held in prisons controlled by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Lyudmyla Denysova alleged on social media that some of the detainees were being interrogated under coercion and enduring terrible living conditions.
Ukraine’s claims were backed up Thursday by a U.S. official who told the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Permanent Council that Russian forces had “forcibly” relocated at least several thousand civilians, subjecting them to “brutal interrogations” in Russian “filtration centers.” Russia has also evacuated tens of thousands civilians to Russia or Russia-controlled territory.
“Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that ‘filtering out’ entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state,” said Michael Carpenter, OSCE’s U.S. ambassador. “These actions amount to war crimes.”
Three people were killed and 12 injured after Russians launched missiles at a local school, a college dormitory and private homes in Novgorod-Siversky, a city in the northern region of Chernihiv, Ukrainian military officials said Thursday.
“The Russians, who claim to be attacking only military installations, are waging war against our children,” Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, said in a Telegram post. “In fact, they are waging war against our future.”

The United Nations’ top human rights representative Thursday blamed the Russian military and its proxies for most of the war’s civilian deaths.
“According to our information, while such incidents can be attributed to both parties to the conflict, most of these casualties appear attributable to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups,” High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said at a special session of the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council.
She said the “vast majority” of the casualties were caused by explosive weapons, including heavy artillery and missiles.
The council is expected to vote on a resolution repeating its demand “for the immediate cessation of military hostilities against Ukraine.” The U.N. General Assembly suspended Russia from the human rights council last month amid allegations of atrocities by Russian forces in the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where bodies of civilians bearing signs of torture and summary execution have been uncovered.

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.

Russia’s determination to continue its war against Ukraine has spooked other neighboring countries, including Finland, a country of 5.5 million people, which had up to now refrained from joining NATO so as to not provoke Moscow. Putin has long viewed NATO’s expansion, particularly its addition of former Eastern Bloc nations such as Poland and Romania after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as an existential threat to Russia.
Attitudes in Finland toward NATO changed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sparked the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. Polls show that 76% of the population now supports joining the defense pact, a dramatic swing from late 2017 during the country’s centennial, when only 19% favored membership.
“The Finnish population looked at Ukraine and said, ‘Russia could do this to Finland,’” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a security expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “At the same time, there’s the realization that Russia talks about using nuclear weapons in a way Finland cannot address. Finland has no deterrence for nuclear weapons. The only way to do that is to become a NATO” member.
Germany, too, has changed its security calculus, pledging a $100-billion boost in military spending to reach targets set by NATO that it had failed to meet for years.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, buoyed by Germany’s’ shifting position, called on German companies to pull out of Russia and relocate to Ukraine.
“As Russia keeps committing heinous atrocities in Ukraine, revenues of foreign companies still doing business in Russia are stained with Ukrainian blood,” Kuleba posted on Twitter. “I urge German businesses to pull out of Russia and relocate to Ukraine. This will be a sincere contribution to peace in Europe.”

More than 4.6 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded, but millions more have stayed to help defend their country. These are their stories.


But European officials will need more than just U.S. support to bring Moscow to heel, which is one reason why European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was in Tokyo on Thursday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Her visit followed one by Finnish Prime Minister Marin on Wednesday.
Von der Leyen and Kishida called on China — which has steadfastly refused to criticize Russia over Ukraine — to do more to exert influence on the Kremlin to bring an end to the war.
“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not just a matter for Europe, but it shakes the core of the international order, including Asia. This must not be tolerated,” said Kishida, whose government has joined Western sanctions against Russia.

The two top defense officials in the U.S. and Russia, meanwhile, held their first direct communication in nearly three months, but Moscow remained uninterested in Western calls for an immediate cease-fire in a war that has battered cities, left thousands dead, spawned millions of refugees and sparked fears of a global food crisis.
To underscore its resolve, Russian forces aimed a punishing new barrage at areas in the country’s north, east and south, including bombardment of a final Ukrainian redoubt in the shattered southern port of Mariupol.
Repeated attempts by the government in Kyiv to broker a deal to evacuate wounded soldiers from a sprawling steel plant — the last sliver of territory in the city held by Ukrainian forces — have so far failed.
Seeking to intensify Western pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the bloc would soon revisit the notion of an embargo of Russian oil. Hungary has so far resisted such a step, but Borrell expressed the belief that those reservations could be overcome despite worries in Europe of economic hardship.
“We need this agreement, and we will have it,” he said Friday as Group of 7 foreign ministers from wealthy democracies gathered in Germany.
And Britain announced new sanctions targeting the “wallet” of Putin’s family and friends, including his ex-wife as well as his purported mistress, a former Olympic gymnast and mother of his most recent children.
“We are exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin’s luxury lifestyle and tightening the vice on his inner circle,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. “We will keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin’s aggression until Ukraine prevails.”

Amid diplomatic maneuvering and heavy fighting, Ukraine began what was described as the first war crimes proceeding stemming from the nearly 3-month-old invasion. A 21-year-old Russian tank commander appeared Friday in court on charges of shooting an unarmed civilian who was riding his bicycle in a northeastern Ukrainian village.

After staying behind as long as they dare, residents who decide to flee besieged Mariupol find that a long and nerve-racking ordeal awaits.

Ukraine says it is investigating thousands of alleged war crimes as the trial of Sgt. Vadim Shyshimarin, who stood with a shaved head in a glass box, opened in a Kyiv courtroom. The soldier, who was captured by Ukrainian forces, could face life in prison in the shooting of an unarmed 62-year-old civilian man in the northern village of Chupakhiva.
Ukrainian investigators, backed by international experts, have interviewed thousands of witnesses and survivors and collected evidence from mass graves and the sites of shootings.
The Russian retreat from areas near the Ukrainian capital followed weeks of its forces occupying suburbs and satellite towns to Kyiv’s north and west. In their wake, the Russian forces left a trove of evidence of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, which Moscow denies took place.
Meanwhile, Pentagon officials reported the first telephone contact between the top defense officials in the U.S. and Russia since before the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine more than two and a half months ago. U.S Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for about an hour Friday and called for an immediate cease-fire, the Pentagon said, without revealing a response.
“We hope this is a springboard for further communication ... now that they have reconnected,” a senior Pentagon official said. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have been regularly seeking to speak with Shoigu or other senior Russian officials with no success.

Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.

As fighting rages in eastern Ukraine, Russian commanders are under growing pressure to make battlefield gains even if it means taking risks that can backfire, a British military intelligence assessment said.
The assessment cited widely viewed video of Russian armored vehicles destroyed during an attempted river crossing, which was posted online by Ukraine’s military. The images could not be independently verified.
Ukrainian troops have managed to push Russian troops away from the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, Ukrainian and Western military officials say, more than a month after Russia broke off an attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv.
But Russian forces have slowly taken some ground elsewhere in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, and heavy use of artillery against populated areas is exacting a horrific civilian toll.

Politics
Veterans of the Lincoln Project are using lessons learned in 2020 to help Ukraine combat Russian lies and misinformation.
While the front lines have been fluid in some areas, with some villages changing hands repeatedly, clashes along a 300-mile battlefront have been punctuated by some decisive losses and gains. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that more than a dozen Russian armored vehicles were destroyed while trying to cross the Seversky Donets River near the village of Bilohorivka in Luhansk, one of two provinces making up the Donbas region, the war’s main battleground.
U.S. officials said they could not confirm reports that the Ukrainians had destroyed a pontoon bridge being used by the Russians but did say they had credible intelligence that Russians were incurring losses along rivers.
Western analysis of the event placed it in the context of other setbacks suffered by Russian forces during the war, including the failed early attempt to capture Kyiv, saying Moscow’s military leaders were probably under increasing duress as a result.
“Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky maneuver and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine,” the daily British military assessment said.
Based on images of the event, Russia lost “significant armored maneuver elements” of at least one battalion tactical group, the intelligence report said.

Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an overnight video address to his nation broadcast early Saturday, said it was impossible to predict how long the war would last — even as Putin is reportedly settling in for a prolonged conflict.
“This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum,” Zelensky said. “This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.”
In an address 24 hours earlier, he asserted that “Russia’s strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world” — speaking in part in reaction to support voiced by Finland’s leaders for joining NATO, reversing years of neutrality and marking a shift in Europe’s security architecture.
The Kremlin responded to the Finnish announcement, and a similar one considered likely soon from Sweden, with threats of unspecified “military technical” measures. The White House and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg both said Finnish and Swedish membership applications would be welcomed.
But in one potential hitch, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he opposed the inclusion of the Scandinavian states. Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Erdogan cited the support that Finland and Sweden have supposedly given the Kurdish minorities in Turkey, whom his government regards as terrorists.
With Western nations continuing to search for ways to dissuade Putin from pressing on with the war, G-7 foreign ministers held their seventh such gathering since the Feb. 24 invasion. At the meeting in Germany, Truss, the British foreign secretary, urged the allies to keep economic sanctions in place until Russian troops leave Ukraine.
International sanctions are slowly chiseling away at the cloak of secrecy surrounding Putin’s private life.
The targets announced Friday include his ex-wife, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who became a well-heeled businesswoman after her divorce; Alina Kabaeva, a former Olympic athlete who heads a private Russian media company and is purportedly his mistress; and Kabaeva’s grandmother, Anna Zatseplina, another close business associate.

“Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said last month.
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III went a step further. The United States isn’t merely helping Ukraine win, he said; it’s using the war to undermine Russia’s status as a world power.
Politics
A Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade would unsettle politics nationwide, but especially in a few key states.

“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kind of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said.
Last week, U.S. officials disclosed that American intelligence helped Ukrainian forces kill as many as 12 Russian generals and sink the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet — humiliating setbacks for Moscow’s once-proud armed forces.
It’s good news, of course, that Ukraine is holding its own against Russia’s invasion. And yes, the United States and its allies deserve credit for helping the Kyiv government survive.
But several things are wrong with this picture.
For one thing, Ukraine hasn’t quite won yet. The chest-thumping is premature.

Russian forces are close to taking full control of the port city of Mariupol; that will give it a prize it has long sought: a “land bridge” between the Crimean peninsula and Russia. The Russians could also expand the territory they hold in eastern Ukraine, where fierce fighting is underway. If that happens, Kyiv’s “victory” could soon look less impressive.
For another, it’s unusual for U.S. officials to claim credit, even anonymously, for successful intelligence sharing. The problem isn’t that they’re revealing state secrets; Russia already knew the U.S. was helping the Ukrainians with targeting.
The problem is that President Vladimir Putin has tried to rally support — among both his own people and those of other countries — by portraying Russia as the victim of a U.S. plot. We just helped him make his case.
“The war in Ukraine does not have anything to do with Ukraine,” a commentary shown on Russian state television claimed last week. “The war in Ukraine was designed to cause regime change in Moscow.”
The commentator was Tucker Carlson of Fox News.
More important, the United States has quietly escalated its goals in the war but without much clarity about exactly what they are.
That’s a phenomenon known as “mission creep,” and it’s a recipe for trouble. Just ask former President George W. Bush, who led the United States into overambitious wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“You don’t want to create pressure on yourself to do more than is wise to do,” Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations, a top State Department official in the Bush administration, told me.
One reason the U.S.-led alliance in support of Ukraine has held together so impressively is that its initial goal was clear and broadly shared: helping the Kyiv government defend itself.
Now the goals are getting blurry, and that’s beginning to create division among U.S. allies.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu complained recently that some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “want the war to continue. … They want Russia to become weaker,” an apparent reference to Austin’s announced aims.
Meanwhile, Britain’s combative foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said her country is committed “to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine,” a more ambitious goal than even the Biden administration has embraced.
“I don’t think we have shared definitions of success,” Haass said. “That’s a problem.”
Expanding the goals of the war could stiffen Putin’s determination to keep fighting or push him toward escalating, perhaps by resorting to chemical or nuclear weapons.
“Austin’s statement reinforces Putin’s belief that this is an existential threat,” Haass warned. “You don’t want to push him into a corner any smaller than the one he’s already painted himself into.”
Some day, Russia and Ukraine will decide to stop fighting. At that point, there will need to be cease-fire talks and, perhaps, negotiations toward a peace settlement. U.S. diplomats may even want to dust off the concept of “offramps” — offers to make it easier for Russia to compromise.
And once the war is over, the United States and Russia will still need to deal with each other on a broad range of issues.
Escalating goals and premature claims of victory won’t help us get there any faster.
In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt described his foreign policy as “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”
Last month, President Biden said he wanted to use the same approach in Ukraine. “We will speak softly and carry a large Javelin,” he said.
This would be a good time for him to take his own advice."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invited U2 frontman Bono and the Edge to perform a mini-concert in Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.

As fighting raged in Ukraine’s east, tensions rose on the eve of a major Russian holiday celebrating the then-Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany 77 years ago in World War II. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to use Monday’s Victory Day commemorations to somehow glorify, or at least rebrand, his army’s 10-week-old invasion of Ukraine.
In a preview of his holiday messaging, Putin on Sunday described Russia’s war in Ukraine as meant to achieve Ukrainians’ “liberation of their native land from Nazi filth.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky put a very different stamp on the memorial occasion, observed Sunday in Ukraine — a Soviet republic before it became independent more than 30 years ago — as the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. The United States and most of Europe mark May 8 as V-E Day.
In a starkly dramatic video shot in the badly damaged Kyiv satellite town of Borodianka, occupied by Russia during Moscow’s failed attempt early in the war to capture Kyiv, Zelensky likened his country’s fierce resistance against the invasion to the World War II struggle against fascism.
“Never again?” he asked, with ruined buildings as a backdrop. “Try telling Ukraine that.”

Separately, the Ukrainian leader said in his overnight video address that the brutality of Russia’s war against its smaller neighbor “should remind every state and every nation that it is impossible to defeat evil once and for all.”
Amid continuing Western efforts to get Putin to break off his assault, leaders of the Group of Seven nations, including President Biden, held a video consultation with Zelensky on Sunday.
“We reiterate our condemnation of Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal military aggression against Ukraine and the indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, which has resulted in terrible humanitarian catastrophe in the heart of Europe,” the leaders wrote in a statement following the hourlong session. “We are appalled by the large-scale loss of human life, assault on human rights, and destruction that Russia’s actions have inflicted on Ukraine.”

New G-7 sanctions target Russian state-controlled TV stations, the industrial sector and finance executives from major banks.

In addition to announcing further sanctions, the G-7 said it was committed to phasing out the use of Russian oil and gas, or banning them outright, but did not give a timetable for doing so. The U.S. has already banned Russian energy imports, but Europe is considerably more dependent.
The sanctions include steps against three major state-controlled Russian media organizations and more Russian elites being targeted by visa restrictions.
The call, intended as a show of Western solidarity, came hours after Jill Biden’s trip to Ukraine, which was disclosed after she had departed the country.
In a rare war-zone visit by a sitting first lady, Biden spent about two hours inside Ukraine, holding a Mother’s Day meeting with Olena Zelenska, Zelensky’s wife, at a school in the town of Uzhhorod, a short drive from the Slovakian border.
Biden, whose trip came amid a four-day visit to front-line countries in eastern Europe, said she wanted to make the visit on Mother’s Day to underscore that “this war has been brutal, and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.”
Zelenska, appearing publicly for the first time since the Russians invaded her nation, thanked Biden for her “courageous act” at a time when “military actions are taking place every day, where air sirens are happening every day.”
Trudeau presided over a flag-hoisting at the Canadian Embassy in Kyiv and met with Ukrainian officials. His visit to the outlying town of Irpin was documented by its mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, who wrote on Telegram that the Canadian leader, the latest in a string of visiting dignitaries, was shown “the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city.”
In the south of Ukraine, in the bomb-flattened port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said efforts were turning Sunday to extracting defenders of a sprawling steel plant that is the final Ukrainian redoubt in the strategic city.

It’s good news that Ukraine is holding its own against Russia’s invasion. And yes, the United States and its allies deserve credit for helping the Kyiv government survive. But the chest-thumping is premature.

The last of the civilians trapped there — women, children and the elderly — were brought to safety on Saturday, Ukrainian officials said, after spending hungry and frightened weeks seeking safety in the steel plant’s warren of underground bunkers and tunnels.
The United Nations’ humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine announced Sunday that more than 170 people had been evacuated from Mariupol after 10 weeks of shelling and brought to Zaporizhzhia, a city in southeastern Ukraine. More than 600 people have now been evacuated from the Mariupol area, according to coordinator Osnat Lubrani.
“We are also working to evacuate our military,” Zelensky said in his overnight address. “We do not lose hope, we do not stop — every day we are looking for a diplomatic option that could work out.”
In an online appeal from inside the plant Sunday, a Ukrainian commander, Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, said the defenders would “continue to fight as long as we are alive.” The Ukrainian forces have repeatedly refused to surrender, saying they expected to be tortured and killed by Russian forces if they did.
Russia, which has been trying since the start of the war to capture Mariupol, is thought to attach not only practical but symbolic importance to finally subduing the city in time for Monday’s Victory Day celebrations.
Putin declared victory in the battle of Mariupol on April 21, but full control of the city will give Moscow the ability to create a land bridge between territory where it holds sway and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014.
Municipal officials have said up to 20,000 Mariupol residents have died in the course of the war, and satellite imagery has pinpointed the presence of mass graves on the ruined city’s outskirts.
In Ukraine’s eastern battle zone, Ukrainian officials described a horrific toll on noncombatants caught in intensifying Russian bombardment. Moscow’s forces have been using barrages of artillery, often hitting civilian areas, to try to break through Ukrainian lines.

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.
In the village of Bilohorivka, in Luhansk province, about 90 people were sheltering at a school when it was bombed and burst into flames Saturday, Ukrainian officials said. Regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said about 30 people had been rescued, with two confirmed dead and seven others injured, leaving dozens unaccounted for in the incinerated wreckage.
“Sixty people were likely to have died under the rubble,” he wrote Sunday on the Telegram messaging app.
Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry called the shelling of the school a war crime. Noting that the attack took place hours before the start of Ukrainian commemorations of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the ministry said Russian forces were “constantly repeating the tragedy of World War II.”
In a separate episode in the village of Shypilovo, about 11 people were thought to have been inside a home that was hit by shelling, Haidai said, citing preliminary information. His province, Luhansk, is one of two making up the Donbas region, the industrial heartland that Russia is trying to capture.
Adding to the misery of life in the battle zone, a Russian airstrike in Luhansk damaged electrical infrastructure, cutting off power to the Ukrainian-held part of the province. Many civilians have fled, at the government’s urging, but tens of thousands of residents remain in the area.
Western military analysts have painted Russia’s much-vaunted offensive in Ukraine’s east as beset by problems. An assessment Sunday by British military intelligence cited “difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance on the front line,” a 300-mile arc stretching from Ukraine’s southeast to northeast.
Following actor and humanitarian Angelina Jolie’s trip to western Ukraine last week, Sunday saw another celebrity visit to the country. Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, and its guitarist the Edge staged a surprise performance at a Kyiv subway station where residents had sheltered from bombardment earlier in the war. In addition to some of their signature songs, they invited a soldier to join them in performing Ben E. King’s “Stand By Me.” On Twitter, the group said Zelensky had invited them to visit the capital.

“The president’s order has been carried out,” Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, posted on the Telegram messaging app, offering little further detail. “This part of the Mariupol humanitarian operation has been completed.”
More than 5.8 million refugees have fled fighting in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a Saturday night address to his nation, said more than 300 civilians were rescued from the steel plant in recent days and efforts were underway to prepare for the second stage of the evacuation: the wounded and medics.
Zelensky said he was also working to evacuate Ukrainian troops at the plant from a feared slaughter — a mission that he noted was “extremely difficult.” The armed forces inside the complex have so far rebuffed Russian surrender demands, but officials are worried that Moscow wants the steel plant flattened as a symbolic prize in advance of Russia’s annual Victory Day celebration Monday.
“But we do not lose hope,” Zelensky said. “We do not stop. Every day we are looking for a diplomatic option that can work out.”
The Kremlin’s push for a sign of victory became more pressing as Russian forces made little headway in their attempts to seize control of Ukraine’s northeast. On Saturday, the Ukrainian military said its troops had managed to push Moscow’s forces back from some artillery positions near Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city. Located at the northeastern tip of the battle zone, just 25 miles from the Russian border, the city has been under relentless bombardment since the war’s earliest days.
But Russia’s grinding onslaught carried on in other parts of the country. On Saturday, a Ukrainian official accused Russia of dropping a bomb on a school in Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, head of the regional military administration in the eastern Luhansk region, posted on Telegram that about 90 people had been taking shelter in the school. So far, he reported, 30 people had been rescued from the rubble.
“Almost the entire village was hiding,” he wrote, noting that the school offered the only underground refuge for the community after the town’s social club was hit. “The basement of the school was the only place of salvation, but the Russians took this chance from people.”

In the Kharkiv region, Zelensky said, a Russian missile destroyed a museum honoring Hryhorii Skovoroda, an 18th century poet, composer and philosopher with Socratic and Stoic leanings.
In an operational report early Saturday, the Ukrainian army said its troops have been waging a counteroffensive near Kharkiv, and that Russian forces had blown up three bridges in an attempt to slow that push.
Though the city itself has remained in Ukrainian hands throughout the war, the Russian army has used captured outlying areas as a base from which to batter the city, which was home to nearly 1.5 million people before Russia invaded.
Ukrainian forces reported Saturday that they regained control of the town of Tsyrkuny, about 10 miles northeast of central Kharkiv. Ukraine also claimed to have destroyed a Serna-class Russian landing craft in the Black Sea with a drone strike. Satellite photos analyzed by the Associated Press showed Ukrainian drones had flattened most of the buildings on Russian-occupied Snake Island, as well as what appeared to be a Serna-class landing craft.
But the Ukrainian strikes on Snake Island did not appear to have gone unpunished. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Russian aircraft shot down a Ukrainian Su-24 bomber, Su-27 fighter jet, three Mi-8 helicopters with paratroopers, and two Bayraktar-TB2 drones near Snake Island, according to state news agency Tass.
Russia also fired six cruise missiles on the southern port city of Odesa. According to a statement from Odesa’s City Council, four missiles hit a private furniture company and destroyed high-rise buildings in a residential area, and two missiles struck the runway and flight control system at an airport. No casualties were reported.
“The enemy continues not only the physical destruction of the region’s infrastructure, but also the psychological pressure on the civilian population,” the Ukrainian military’s Operational Command South posted on Telegram after the attack. “The Ukrainian nation is unbreakable.”

Relieved but anxious and fearful, passengers on a Ukrainian train describe the horrors of the Russian invasion and recount what they left behind.
After a string of setbacks for Russia, Ukraine is wary that Moscow will lash out in frustration. Zelensky, in his late-night video address Friday, implored Ukrainians to exercise caution over the weekend in advance of Russia’s military holiday and parade.
On Saturday, larger numbers of Ukrainian troops than usual could be seen patrolling the streets of Kyiv, the capital.
“I ask all our citizens — especially these days — not to ignore the air raid sirens,” Zelensky said. “Please, this is your life, the life of your children.”
On the eve of the 77th anniversary of Victory Day — a celebration of World War II allies’ formal acceptance of Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender — U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin sought “to twist history to attempt to justify his unprovoked and brutal war against Ukraine.”
Those who study the past, Blinken said in a statement, understood that Zelensky and the people of Ukraine “embody the spirit of those who prevailed” during World War II. “We must increase our resolve,” he argued, “to resist those who now seek to manipulate historical memory in order to advance their own ambitions.”
In a show of support for Ukraine, the leaders of the world’s seven largest advanced economies, including the United States, will hold video consultations with Zelensky on Sunday.
President Biden will participate in the Group of Seven talks with the Ukrainian leader, which are meant in part to emphasize common resolve in response to the 10-week-old war, the White House said. The G-7 also includes Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy.
On Saturday, a senior Russian lawmaker criticized U.S. involvement in Ukraine, accusing the Biden administration of “taking part in hostilities” against Russia by providing Ukraine intelligence, not just weapons and equipment.
“Washington essentially coordinates and develops military operations, thereby directly participating in the hostilities against our country,” Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, wrote in a Telegram post.
There is expected to be an abundance of bellicose Kremlin rhetoric associated with the holiday, which commemorates the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany, but Ukraine is also braced for potentially punishing strikes on civilian areas, or some new effort by Moscow to seize the military initiative in what Western analysts and military officials depict as a brutal but faltering offensive.
In an analysis released Saturday, British military intelligence cited “a heavy toll on some of Russia’s most capable units.” Plagued by supply-line problems, heavy casualties and low troop morale, the Russian command last month broke off an attempt to seize Kyiv and shifted its attention to the eastern front.

Three Ukrainians have found refuge, and a way to share the recipes of their homeland, in a fancy Paris restaurant.
“It will take considerable time and expense for Russia to reconstitute its armed forces following this conflict,” the British assessment said.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that has been monitoring battlefield developments, pointed in its latest assessment to the Ukrainian counteroffensive outside Kharkiv, saying troops “may successfully push Russian forces out of artillery range” of the city in coming days.
In the ongoing battle for control of territory in the eastern Donbas region, the Ukrainian military said Saturday its troops had repulsed eight Russian attacks in the last 24 hours. Russia, meanwhile, stepped up what it says are attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and Western-supplied weaponry.
Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Saturday to have destroyed a cache of armaments from the U.S. and European allies near a railway station in the Kharkiv region. It also said Russian forces struck 18 military facilities overnight, including the Odesa ammunition depot. The claims could not immediately be independently verified.
In Mariupol, the evacuation of the last women, children and elderly people from the giant Azovstal plant, where hundreds of civilians sheltered underground for weeks along with Ukrainian troops, marked the end of a long and tense rescue operation. About 50 civilians were brought out Friday, Vereshchuk said, after a rescue effort was slowed by Russian violations of a local cease-fire.
The rescue operation, conducted with the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, did not end without casualties. Petro Andriushchenko, an advisor to Mariupol’s City Council, wrote on Telegram that three Ukrainian soldiers had died during an evacuation attempt and six others were wounded.
“They will suffer terribly, because there is no medicine left in the bunker,” he wrote.
“Politicians and world leaders are thanking each other for the successful evacuation of civilians,” he added. “For some reason no one applauds those who laid down their lives for the lives of civilians.… They gave their lives for others to enjoy the fresh air.”

In the New Testament accounts of the resurrection of Jesus, no passage is more poignant than Mary Magdalene’s breathless declaration to the apostles Peter and John: “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” We can well imagine that far too many families in Ukraine in this moment of darkness are saying much the same thing as they search for loved ones amid the carnage of war: “We do not know where they have laid him.”
Mass graves are being unearthed. Executed civilians, hands tied behind their backs, have been left by the side of the road. Entire cities have been essentially wiped off the map. Rescuers seek the living and the dead, sheltered or homeless or buried beneath the rubble.
The story that Christians call the Passion narrative reminds us of the presence of evil in the world — as if we needed such a reminder.
You don’t have to share the Christian belief that Jesus was the son of God to acknowledge that he was a decent and gentle man, someone who heralded the meek and told his followers to turn the other cheek, someone who lauded peacemakers and insisted that anyone who aspired to follow him must visit prisoners, welcome the foreigner, care for orphans and widows and take notice of those he called “the least of these.”
Yet, despite his gentleness and compassion, despite his renunciation of temporal power, Jesus died the slow, excruciating death of an insurrectionist at the hands of Roman authorities. Yes, there is evil in the world.
The people of Ukraine understand that too well. Without provocation, a neighboring autocrat has decided to feed his insatiable ego by invading a sovereign nation, exacting a fearsome toll of casualties and destruction. This madman, who professes to be a follower of Jesus, has prosecuted his war against Ukraine with no regard to “just war” theory.
What is worse, Vladimir Putin has perpetrated this evil with the apparent blessing of the Russian Orthodox Church.  A new Orthodox cathedral, dedicated to the armed forces and located on the outskirts of Moscow, featured a massive mosaic depicting Putin and his  advisors triumphantly celebrating the Russian conquest of Crimea in 2014. High above the scene, the Blessed Virgin Mary cast her protective veil, suggesting that the annexation was divinely sanctioned.
The backlash was swift, and the image was removed before the cathedral’s consecration. When apprised of the matter, Putin reportedly remarked, “Someday our grateful descendants will appreciate our accomplishments. But for now, it is still too early for that.”
Far too often, evil and ego walk hand in hand. And far too often those who purport to be followers of Jesus have perpetrated such evil.
From the Crusades and the Wars of Religion to Manifest Destiny, from the Inquisition and the scourge of slavery to “enhanced interrogation” at Abu Ghraib and children separated from parents at the border, those who claim to be Christians have been complicit in violence and evil. Putin’s gratuitous invasion of Ukraine is merely the most recent example.
What do we make of the persistence of evil more than 2,000 years after Mary Magdalene frantically searched for the body of Jesus? Phalanxes of theologians through the centuries have tried to explain it, blaming everything from social circumstances to human nature itself.
But the fact remains that we have not eradicated evil from the world, and the deterrents we have devised — shaming, incarceration, sanctions, war crimes tribunals — may have stanched some of the violence, but they certainly haven’t eliminated the incidence of evil.
Where does this leave us, especially those who identify as followers of Jesus, during this season of Easter? It’s unrealistic to expect that we can undo the evil of decades and centuries past, although we bear responsibility for reconciliation and reparations.
Our best strategy is to address the evil at hand, before it metastasizes into a greater peril. In the case of Ukraine, many nations have united in opposition to Putin, and for now at least, their calculation is that violence should not be met with violence.
In the face of such titanic forces, it may seem that there’s little individuals can do to eliminate or redress the war’s overwhelming evil. But we can act in small ways — with contributions to humanitarian organizations, with forthright condemnations of Russian Orthodox complicity and yes, prayer. As the Bible says, we weep with those who weep. And no, Putin does not deserve to be  heroized in an Orthodox cathedral for his monstrous invasion of neighboring nations.
The resurrection narrative in the New Testament attests to the presence of evil. But Easter is also a story of hope. Mary Magdalene did find Jesus, and the Christian gloss on that discovery is that evil and death do not have the final word.

In an apparent response to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, who said Monday that the U.S. wanted Russia permanently “weakened,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the United States of escalating tensions.
Asked on Russian TV whether the current situation was comparable to the Cuban missile crisis, which brought the U.S. and Russia to the brink of nuclear war in 1962, Lavrov said his country wants to avoid nuclear conflict, and then added: “The danger is serious, it’s real. It should not be underestimated.”
“NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy,” he said. “War means war.”
Defense officials from dozens of countries met at the U.S. air base in Ramstein, Germany, where the agenda focused on accelerating the arms shipments. In a dramatic shift, Germany announced that for the first time it would send air-defense tanks to Ukraine. Other nations pledged howitzers, tanks, rockets, drones, hand grenades and rifles.
Russia expanded its assault on southern and eastern regions of Ukraine overnight, saying its forces killed 500 “enemy personnel” — a claim that could not be verified — and hit military targets in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Ukraine cited fresh attacks on civilians as well as military sites.

“Russian troops have launched an offensive in all directions,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
He said Russia was zeroing in on the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk in the east and Kryvyi Rih — Zelensky’s hometown — in the south.

The war between Ukraine and Russia, which supply 75% of the world’s sunflower oil, has caused already-rising cooking oil prices to spiral upward.

The British Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russians had also overtaken the city of Kreminna, in the Luhansk region, though Ukraine did not confirm the city’s fall.
Officials said two missiles struck the central city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least one person.
In the southern city of Kherson, which fell to Russia early in the war, the occupiers have scheduled a vote this week on the creation of a so-called independent Kherson People’s Republic.
The move, which Zelensky called a “sham referendum,” would follow a long-term Russian strategy of fomenting unrest in the eastern region of Donbas, where pro-Russia separatists have already declared breakaway republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that a chief reason he invaded Ukraine was to “liberate” ethnic Russians.

The war, now in its third month, has left mass graves and rubble in cities and towns across Ukraine, including the southern port of Mariupol, which Russia claimed victory over last week even as a group of Ukrainian troops remains holed up in a sprawling steel plant. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said a new mass grave — the third to be named, this time in the village of Staryi Krym — was discovered just outside the city.

Kyiv, the capital, which has largely been spared attack over the last month as Russia shifted its offensive south and east, imposed a nightly curfew this week amid increasing concerns about further violence. And in the Black Sea port of Odesa, authorities reported an explosion that damaged a bridge over the Dniester River and cut off rail connections with neighboring Romania.
In an overnight video address, Zelensky said Ukraine — which has lost about 3,000 troops compared with unconfirmed estimates of up to 15,000 deaths among the Russians — would keep fighting to “make the occupiers’ stay in our land even more intolerable.”

Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.

Zelensky and Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, have dismissed the Russian warnings of nuclear conflict.
“Russia loses last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,” Kuleba tweeted. “Thus, the talk of a ‘real’ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat.”
The war also continued to spill into neighboring Moldova, where local officials in Transnistria, a pro-Russia breakaway enclave, said two radio towers were damaged in explosions Tuesday — a day after similar explosions were reported in the region’s capital, Tiraspol.
Ukraine’s intelligence agency has described such attacks as “planned provocation” by Russian intelligence. Last week, a senior Russian military official told state media that Russia wanted control of southern Ukraine in order to have a land corridor to Transnistria, also known as Trans-Dniester.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has now brought about a sea change in U.S. foreign policy.

At the summit in Germany, the U.S. Defense secretary described Ukraine as “fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens.”
“Russia’s invasion is indefensible, and so are Russian atrocities,” Austin said, adding that Russia has already been significantly weakened after two months of fighting.
“Casualties are pretty substantial,” he told reporters at the air base. “They’ve lost a lot of equipment. They’ve used a lot of precision-guided munitions. … And so they are in fact, in terms of military capability, weaker than when they started.”
Austin said again that the United States aimed to ensure that Russia is never again able to invade a peaceful neighbor. He also derided Russian comments warning of possible nuclear warfare as “clearly unhelpful” saber rattling.
Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told those attending the summit that “time is not on Ukraine’s side.”
“The outcome of this battle, right here, today, is dependent on the people in this room,” he said.

The attendees included representatives from major European nations as well as Turkey and Israel. South Africa and Japan participated virtually.

Ukrainian leaders, who did not succeed in earlier attempts to secure a no-fly zone enforced by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to prevent Russian attacks, had redoubled their efforts on asking for more and deadlier armaments.

Russian forces have more artillery, tanks and heavy fighting units than Ukraine, but they have been plagued by problems as they enter a pivotal battle for eastern Ukraine.

“We say again and again: weapon, weapons, weapons! We need weapons to keep standing and defending the values of humankind,” Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, tweeted Tuesday.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said that in addition to pledging billions in military and humanitarian aid, the U.S. is also holding Moscow accountable through sanctions, export controls and visa restrictions.
“The Moscow that prepared to invade and that on Feb. 24 went forward with its invasion will not be the same Russian Federation in terms of its positioning on the world stage,” he said. “You can already see the toll on Russia’s economy and its financial system.”
He added: “Not only will Ukraine emerge sovereign and independent when this is over, but Moscow will emerge weaker.”
Pushing back against sanctions, Russia will suspend natural gas deliveries to both Poland and Bulgaria starting Wednesday, according to officials from both countries. It is the first time Putin has made good on his threat to cut off “unfriendly foreign buyers” unless they pay in Russian rubles.
Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with Putin and Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.
Underscoring the difficulty of ending a war that has raged without pause through multiple rounds of negotiations, Guterres told reporters in Moscow that his “very frank discussion” with Lavrov showed “it is clear that there are two different positions on what is happening in Ukraine.”
He said the U.N. was looking for opportunities to negotiate cease-fires to move civilians to safety.
“We urgently need humanitarian corridors that are truly safe and effective and that are respected by all to evacuate civilians and deliver much-needed assistance,” he said.
Guterres is to travel Thursday to Kyiv to meet Zelensky.
The war has resulted in a refugee crisis unseen since World War II, with 5.2 million people fleeing Ukraine — a total that the U.N. said could eventually reach 8.3 million. More than 8 million people have been internally displaced.
Among the cities hardest hit has been Kharkiv, which lies about 25 miles from the Russian border and has been subjected to near-daily shelling — including in residential zones — since the war began.
On Tuesday, a road on Kharkiv’s outskirts was full of hundreds of people lined up in front of a half-constructed church, where aid workers with the Noah’s Ark Church organization were distributing food.
“Please don’t push. There’s enough food for everyone,” said one man in sunglasses who stood at the gate to manage the crowd. “Be calm, praise God, and glory to Ukraine.”
Inside were pallets loaded with bags of potatoes and onions and boxes of apples. There were also items that reflected the difficulty of maintaining a semblance of ordinary life in a city pummeled daily by Russian forces: cleaning products, matches, small candles.
“There’s a lot of need right now. Some of these people have been lining up since 4 a.m.,” said Andrey Varakuta, a 30-year-old aid worker. “We do this three times a week. Every time we do it, more and more people show up.”

That’s a question Russian President Vladimir Putin will have to answer, at least implicitly, when his country marks one of its biggest and most bombastic patriotic holidays, Victory Day, on Monday — a highly choreographed celebration of Moscow’s military might that awkwardly coincides this year with a smaller neighbor’s improbable defiance in the face of a withering 10-week assault.
“There’s no victory to announce,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at University College London. “So he’ll have to proclaim one all the more loudly.”
The war on Ukraine — the “special military operation,” as the Kremlin dubbed its Feb. 24 invasion — can in no way be said to have gone according to plan. Putin’s armies have killed thousands, flattened once-vibrant cities, sent more than 5.7 million people fleeing into exile and inflicted billions of dollars in damage to Ukraine, a country of 44 million people that became a sovereign nation more than three decades ago when the Soviet Union imploded.

But in these weeks of warfare, Putin’s once-vaunted military has failed to seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or depose its government. Russia has also suffered the ignominious sinking of a flagship missile cruiser and suffered military casualties likely exceeding those of the Soviets’ signature debacle in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
The invasion of Ukraine has re-energized the NATO alliance, pummeled the Russian economy and plunged the country’s 144 million citizens into a degree of isolation not seen since the chilliest days of the Cold War.

World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

Russia, which encountered little meaningful resistance when it seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014 and fomented a separatist war in Ukraine’s east, had by all accounts hoped for a swift victory and speedy installation of a puppet government when its troops and tanks rolled across the borders.

Instead, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has achieved near-Churchillian stature as a wartime leader, and Western dignitaries arrive near-daily in Kyiv, lavishing cash, weaponry and expressions of support on Zelensky’s government.
Yet this is seen by many as a particularly perilous juncture of the war, as Ukraine and its allies wonder whether Putin, livid over a triumph that has eluded him, will lash out in ways not yet seen in this conflict.
Monday’s holiday marks the 77th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, a day of deep emotional resonance for Russians who still recall a staggering death toll of 27 million compatriots in World War II.
On Moscow’s Red Square, Putin, 69, is due to preside over a cavalcade of troops and tanks, rockets and long-range ballistic missiles. Military flyovers will reportedly include a pointed display — the first in more than a decade — of Russia’s airborne “doomsday” command center, a plane meant to carry senior leaders and military officials in the event of a nuclear exchange.

On a day whose overt theme is glorious victory, however, the Ukraine war offers “very, very slim pickings,” said James Nixey, who heads the Russia-Eurasia program at Chatham House, a British think tank.
Putin, he said, “will need to spin a narrative, they will need to say, proclaim something, show they’ve achieved something, and there’s a limited menu from which to do so.”
In recent weeks, Ukrainian and Western analysts and officials have gamed out various Victory Day scenarios: Moscow seeking to engineer a decisive battlefield blow in Ukraine’s east, mounting punishing strikes on cities far from the front lines, or formally annexing more territory under only the shakiest of Russian control.
Other possibilities: a formal declaration of war by Russia, accompanied by a mass troop mobilization, or nuclear saber-rattling even more worrisome than that of recent weeks. Or a Russian push into Moldova, a small, impoverished non-NATO state that borders Ukraine.
In the eyes of many Ukrainians, Putin’s main claim to battlefield success in Ukraine is a Pyrrhic one: the expected final capture of Mariupol, the now-devastated southern port where some of Russia’s worst atrocities are said to have taken place.
Much of the city lies in ruins; municipal authorities say bombardment, hunger and privation have killed more than 20,000 residents. Satellite imagery has pinpointed mass graves on Mariupol’s outskirts.

Hundreds were believed entombed when Russia in March bombed a landmark theater in whose basement desperate families had taken shelter, and a Mariupol maternity hospital suffered a hit that sent terrified pregnant women fleeing — at least, those who survived.
Defenders of a sprawling steel factory complex have mounted a desperate last stand, with widespread expectations that Russia would move to wipe out remaining fighters and civilians alike, in order to proclaim the city’s “liberation” in time for Monday.
Some observers, though, say that in Putin’s Russia, a narrative of conquest could be fashioned out of very little, with horrific conditions in the battle zone presented as proof that Russian troops are fighting bravely to protect the homeland and the Russian speakers of Ukraine.
Analysts say the czarist-era concept of a Potemkin village — an artificial construct meant to provide a false but convincing external facade — could carry over to a chronicle of gains purportedly achieved in Ukraine, especially after months of relentless official propaganda about the righteousness of the Russian cause.
“I don’t think they need an actual victory on the 9th of May, just images of combat actions to show to the Russian population,” Oleksandr Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies, told the Ukrainian online outlet NV. Russian forces could, for example, use video of a temporary breach of Ukrainian defenses in a local area to claim a larger conquest, he said.

The eastern front lines are fluid, with some settlements repeatedly changing hands and Russia making little significant progress since the supposed start of its eastern offensive two weeks ago, Western analysts have said.
The shattered ruins of Mariupol could provide a gruesome backdrop to some form of victory parade on Monday, Ukrainian officials say. They have reported that Russian forces are bribing starving locals to set to work clearing away debris from weeks of relentless bombardment.
“Work in exchange for food — that is the best illustration of this ‘victory,’” said Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the city’s mayor. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week he did not know whether there would be a victory parade in the city.
Ukrainian officials have said an announced troop mobilization by Russia would help it rebuild and reconstitute units shattered by an unsuccessful attempt in March to seize the capital. At the start of the week, the chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, said that such an effort was already in progress and that the holiday would be a pretext for kicking off such a drive.
In a number of localities, including areas that have seen few attacks, municipal officials urged people to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings in the run-up to Monday.
The timing of the warning carried a particular poignancy in a country where many graves have been dug in recent weeks. Under Orthodox Christian tradition, the weeks after Easter, which fell on April 24 this year, are a time to visit the cemetery, often in the company of relatives.
Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, wrote on the messaging app Telegram that people should avoid visiting graveyards in groups.
On Monday, Russia is expected to use the occasion to underscore the Kremlin contention that the Ukrainian government is a hapless pawn of the West and that the real battle is occurring between Russia and the entirety of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Such a claim could serve as the pretext for prosecuting a war that is “dragging on,” as even a Putin ally, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, acknowledged this week in an interview with the Associated Press.
In his expected address, Putin is likely to lean into another familiar — and baseless — theme: likening the war in Ukraine to the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany, the ostensible reason for Monday’s celebrations. The Kremlin spuriously insists that Ukraine is governed by, and overrun by, Nazis."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-05/ukraine-russia-mariupol-steel-plant-last-holdout;2022-05-06;Zelensky pleads for evacuations from Mariupol steel plant - Los Angeles Times;"As Russian troops struck across eastern Ukraine on Thursday and mounted a new push to kill or capture the last remaining Ukrainian fighters defending the besieged port city of Mariupol, new evidence emerged that the U.S. provided intelligence that helped Ukraine sink a formidable Russian warship last month.
An American official told multiple major news outlets, including the Associated Press, that the U.S. has provided “a range of intelligence” to Ukraine, including the location of Russian ships on the Black Sea. The official said Ukraine decided on its own to use that information to target the Moskva, the missile cruiser whose sinking was a strategic and symbolic defeat for Russia.
The Biden administration has increased intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and has ratcheted up its shipments of arms to the war-torn nation, which was invaded by Russia on Feb. 24. The stepped-up involvement comes as Russia seems intent on seizing control — and possibly annexing — large stretches of eastern Ukraine.
Analysts say the Kremlin is eager to proclaim victory in Mariupol, in the southeast, before Monday, when Russia commemorates its role in defeating Nazi Germany during World War II.
Russian soldiers are battling the last Ukrainian holdouts in Mariupol, a group of several hundred fighters holed up at the Azovstal steel plant, which is also housing hundreds of civilians.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday pleaded for a cease-fire to allow the evacuation of civilians who remain trapped beneath the plant in a sprawling complex of subterranean bunkers and tunnels. In an address to the nation, Zelensky said time was still needed “to lift people out of those basements.”
“In the present conditions, we cannot use heavy equipment to clear the rubble away. It all has to be done by hand,” said Zelensky, who also asked for more help from the United Nations, which has joined with the International Committee of the Red Cross to usher civilians to safety from the plant. He said 344 people had been evacuated from Mariupol on Wednesday and taken to Zaporizhzhia, about 120 miles northwest.
Ukrainian officials said the situation has become more dire because Russian soldiers had penetrated the plant’s grounds. The Kremlin has denied that its troops have breached the complex.


Meanwhile, fighting raged in the east along a crescent-shaped, 300-mile-long front line in the Donbas, a region that encompasses the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.
The Russian military said its air force struck dozens of Ukrainian military targets, including multiple concentrations of Ukrainian troops and an ammunition depot near the city of Luhansk. It said it had killed 600 Ukrainian fighters, a claim that could not be independently verified.
Posting on the messaging app Telegram, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian missiles hit homes, killing five people and injuring 25.
World & Nation
Weeks after Russian occupation, rural areas outside Ukraine’s capital still yield forest graves. Exhumations remain a near-daily task for police.

Even as Russia continued its air assault, Kyiv said its forces had regained control of “several settlements” between two key southern districts, Kherson and Mykolaiv. Kherson was the first major city to fall to the Russians and remains in their hands. The Ukrainian-held city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, has been a bulwark against Russian forces moving toward the principal seaport of Odesa.
Ukraine’s military said it had also retaken Staryi Saltiv, about 26 miles northeast of Kharkiv, the nation’s second-largest city, which lies near the northeastern border with Russia.
Still, analysts feared that Ukraine was poised to lose Mariupol, a strategic prize that would allow Moscow to stitch together a land corridor connecting Russia, Crimea and areas farther west. The once-thriving city of about 430,000 people has lost more than three-quarters of its population. It has been the site of some of the war’s biggest tragedies and the subject of some of its most forceful negotiations.
Moscow said that for three days beginning Thursday it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilian evacuations from the besieged steel plant. Russia appears eager to proclaim victory in Mariupol before Monday, when President Vladimir Putin is expected to participate in the major Victory Day ceremony commemorating the Soviet role in World War II.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western reports of Russia using the holiday to launch increased attacks and strengthen its troop presence in Ukraine were “nonsense.” Before the war began, he had described U.S. warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine as false “hysteria.”

World & Nation
A video of Oksana Balandina, who lost both legs to a land mine, and Viktor Vasyliv dancing at their hospital wedding has lifted spirits in Ukraine.


Bedraggled civilians who have made their way from the Mariupol steelworks to Ukrainian-held territory in recent days have recounted a terrifying ordeal punctuated by heavy bombardment, with food, water and medical care almost impossible to obtain.
Ukrainian officials said a bloody battle for the plant was continuing. The plant sits above a vast multistory tangle of tunnels and below-ground bunkers dating to the Soviet era.
A Mariupol mayoral aide, Petro Andryushchenko, described “nonstop shelling and assault, even at night with the adjustment of fire from drones. In some areas, hostilities are already beyond the fence of the plant.” He said that “the last 11 square kilometers of freedom” in Mariupol — about four square miles, the area covered by the plant on the Sea of Azov — had been turned into “hell.”
Ukrainian authorities Thursday reported 629 child casualties — including 221 deaths — in fighting to date, warning that the tally was low because full information is unavailable from Russian-held areas. Altogether, official military and civilian casualty numbers for both nations have exceeded 15,000.

In its daily analysis Thursday, the British Defense Ministry suggested that new military exercises announced by Russian ally Belarus would be used “to fix Ukrainian forces in the north, preventing them from being committed to the battle for the Donbas.” The ministry said it did not expect Belarus, whose territory Russia used to stage its invasion, to join in fighting.
With Western officials and leaders in Ukraine and Russia signaling the war could drag on for months, international sanctions against Moscow have increased each week, largely focused on oligarchs, banks and the energy industry.
The European Union’s chief executive said Wednesday that the bloc should ban Russian oil imports, a proposal that would require unanimous approval from the union’s 27 member nations. The ban would take months to implement and would probably include exemptions for Hungary and Slovakia. A similar move against Russian natural gas imports is also on the table.
EU officials met Thursday to discuss the proposed oil ban. A deal could be finalized this week.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-05/official-us-gave-intel-before-ukraine-sank-russian-warship;2022-05-06;U.S. gave intel before Ukraine sank Russian warship, official says - Los Angeles Times;"The U.S. says it shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva before the strike that sank the warship, an incident that was a high-profile failure for Russia’s military.
An American official said Thursday that Ukraine alone decided to target and sink the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet using its own anti-ship missiles. But given Russia’s attacks on the Ukrainian coastline from the sea, the U.S. has provided “a range of intelligence” that includes locations of those ships, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Biden administration has ramped up intelligence sharing with Ukraine alongside the shipment of arms and missiles to help it repel Russia’s invasion. The disclosure of U.S. support in the Moskva strike comes as the White House is under pressure from Republicans to do more to support Ukraine’s resistance and as polls suggest Americans question whether President Biden is being tough enough on Russia.
Since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion in February, the White House has tried to balance supporting Ukraine, a democratic ally, against not doing anything that would seem to provoke a direct war between Putin and the U.S. and NATO allies. As the war has gone on, the White House has ramped up its military and intelligence support, removing some time and geographic limits on what it will tell Ukraine about potential Russian targets.
The official who spoke Thursday said the U.S. was not aware that Ukraine planned to strike the Moskva until after  it conducted the operation. NBC News first reported on the American role in the sinking of the ship.
Speaking earlier Thursday after a New York Times report about the U.S. role in supporting Ukraine’s killing of Russian generals, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said American agencies “do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military.”
“Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intel that they themselves are gathering and then they make their own decisions and they take their own actions,” Kirby said.
Opinion
U.S. military, intelligence, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine must keep flowing and even increase as the Russian invasion enters a new phase.

The proposal, which marked the EU’s biggest step yet to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, came as the Kremlin’s forces hammered eastern and central Ukraine overnight and targeted several railway stations. Russian forces also struck the west in an attempt to disrupt the flow of Western aid.
The EU’s executive arm put forward a plan for a boycott of Russian oil in an attempt to sever a major source of revenue for the Kremlin’s war machine, having already announced a ban on Russian coal.

World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

But halting oil imports is a process that would take months to complete as the 27-nation EU tries to secure alternative supplies of energy. The ban could have holes in the form of exemptions for members Slovakia and Hungary, which say they are too dependent on Russian oil to support a complete cutoff.
And the proposed ban does not include Russian gas, which the EU buys in greater quantities than oil and relies on more heavily for heating, cooking and industry. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, and other major EU countries have balked at cutting off Russian gas.
Still, sanctions on Russian oil could significantly hamper Moscow’s ability to diversify its economy and modernize. The EU, Russia’s biggest customer for fossil fuels, is estimated to have paid more than $55 billion for Russian oil, gas and coal since Ukraine was invaded Feb. 24, according to the Helsinki-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.


The oil embargo would almost certainly raise prices and inflict pain on consumers in the EU. The proposal is likely to be subject to a fierce debate among EU leaders before they decide whether to adopt it.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the proposal. In a video message posted Wednesday on Twitter, he said Ukraine is not happy that the ban would be delayed for several months, but “it’s better than nothing.”
“As long as Russia continues to receive revenues in billions, literally billions of euros from the European Union, for Russian gas and oil, we cannot speak of defeating Russia,” he said.
Advocates say a ban is necessary to help save Ukraine from destruction.
“Let’s be clear: It will not be easy because some member states are strongly dependent on Russian oil. But we simply have to do it,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament.
The U.S., a much smaller customer, banned Russian oil and gas imports in March.
The proposed European ban was met with skepticism by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a Russian politician, who said EU leaders “have gone a little crazy” and suggested that Russia could circumvent sanctions by selling oil through other countries.
“You will still buy it, only through third countries. Our oil is the same, only more expensive,” he told Russian state media, according to the BBC.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu warned that weapons deliveries from the U.S. and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies were legitimate targets in the war, which after 10 weeks of heavy fighting shows no sign of abating.
Authorities in the contested Donbas region, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, said Russian bombardment in the enclave of Donetsk killed 21 civilians, among them 10 people at a coking plant in the town of Avdiivka. The claim could not be independently verified.

Russia presses new bombing runs in eastern and southern Ukraine as U.S. officials warn or annexation plans

During a news briefing Wednesday afternoon, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Russian forces were attempting to hit “critical infrastructure targets out towards the west” in Ukraine, including electrical power and transportation hubs.
But their aim is not very precise, he said.
“Their ability to target with precision has been less than advertised throughout this entire war. They are not good at precision strikes,” Kirby said.
Parts of the city of Lviv near the Polish border — a major conduit for military supplies from the West — were without power after Russian strikes knocked out electrical substations. Other missiles reportedly targeted the city’s rail network.
The head of Ukraine’s national railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin, said on the messaging app Telegram that overnight missile strikes had hit six railway stations and rail facilities in central and western Ukraine, causing “severe infrastructure damage.”
Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, accused the West of “stuffing Ukraine with weapons,” which Moscow could not allow to go unanswered.
“Any NATO transports carrying weapons or resources for the Ukrainian military that arrive in the country’s territory will be seen by us as a legitimate target to be destroyed,” he said..

Civilians continued to be evacuated from the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol on Wednesday with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. In his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 344 people had been rescued from the city and its suburbs.
The evacuees are believed to be among the last holdouts living alongside Ukrainian soldiers in desperate conditions at the Azovstal steelworks, which has endured weeks of relentless Russian shelling.
Kuleba, the foreign minister, noted that the resistance at Azovstal still stands in the face of continued attacks.
“Despite all the statements by Russian officials that Mariupol is under their full control, this is not true. Azovstal, the stronghold — the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol — still holds,” he said.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it would open evacuation corridors for civilians at the Azovstal factory from Thursday through Saturday.
Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, told reporters that the U.S. would like to see a prolonged humanitarian corridor rather than Russia cloaking itself “in the guise of an actor with humanitarian concerns ... only to quickly resume shelling and violence.”
Hundreds of people are still trapped at the steel plant, he said, in addition to those in Mariupol.
In another sign of the intensifying campaign in the east, British military intelligence said Russia had deployed 22 battalion tactical groups near the city of Izyum, about 75 miles southeast of the heavily bombarded city of Kharkiv, to stage an attack on the nearby cities of Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk.

Landmark church is a lodestar as Ukrainians mourn war dead and pray for living soldiers: ‘Here, we are all together,’ chaplain says.

“Capturing these cities would consolidate Russian military control of the northeastern Donbas and provide a staging point for their efforts to cut off Ukrainian forces in the region,” the British Defense Ministry said in its daily assessment.
Meanwhile, neighboring Belarus launched military drills Wednesday to test its combat readiness, news reports said. Belarus, an ally of Russia, said the exercises posed no threat to its neighbors or the rest of Europe.
Moscow denied speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use the upcoming Victory Day celebrations Monday — a central national ritual that marks the Soviet Union’s triumph over Nazi Germany in World War II — to announce an expansion of the fighting in Ukraine.
Switching from what the Kremlin has limited itself to calling a “special military operation” to a declaration of war would allow for a greater mobilization of Russian society on behalf of the war effort, including reservists.
On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described such rumors as “nonsense.” However, Russia spent weeks denying any intention of invading Ukraine before finally doing so.
The proposed embargo on Russian oil would mark the sixth set of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow since the war began. The EU also plans to remove Russian banks — including its largest, Sberbank — from the SWIFT global financial messaging network, ban three Russian broadcasters and sanction high-ranking military officers suspected of war crimes in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, and Mariupol.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling compatriots to brace for a fateful week, Western military officials warned that Russian forces will probably resort to even more brutal tactics against civilians in a looming offensive in the country’s south and east.
Nearly seven weeks into the war, Russian forces, whose campaign has been marked by strategic stumbles, appeared poised to achieve a major objective: capturing the port city of Mariupol. A Ukrainian marine brigade that described itself as among the last holdouts posted on Facebook that the unit had suffered a “mountain of wounded” and was running out of ammunition.
Zelensky said the city, the scene of one of the war’s most sustained and savage Russian offensives, had been “destroyed” and that tens of thousands of its residents were dead.

PG&E will pay more than $55 million to avoid criminal prosecution for starting two wildfires

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will avoid criminal charges for two wildfires started by its equipment under settlements announced by district attorneys in six Northern California counties.
Prosecutors said the agreements were a better outcome for fire victims and communities because limitations in criminal law make it difficult to hold corporations accountable. Some community advocates said the utility essentially bought its way out of culpability.
As part of the agreements, no criminal charges will be filed in connection with last year’s Dixie fire, and a criminal complaint regarding the 2019 Kincade fire will be dismissed. The utility still faces charges in the 2020 Zogg fire, which killed four people and destroyed more than 200 buildings.
Voters are split on Garcetti. Here’s what that tells us about the race to succeed him
Voters in Los Angeles are evenly divided on Mayor Eric Garcetti’s performance, according to a new poll — a finding that may yield insights into the race to succeed him. The figures are a big decline from when Garcetti won reelection in 2017 with 81% of the vote in a race that wasn’t particularly competitive, but follow a trend of voters expressing unhappiness with elected officials at all levels.
The poll revealed notable data about perceptions of the mayor and candidates in this year’s mayoral election. Voters supportive of candidate Rick Caruso were more likely to disapprove of Garcetti’s performance, while voters who backed candidate Rep. Karen Bass were likely to approve of the mayor.

Coronavirus cases on the rise in L.A. County, prompting calls for caution
Coronavirus cases are once again on the rise in Los Angeles County, according to new data, prompting officials to urge residents to keep up safety protocols as the busy spring break holiday season arrives.
Data show that for the seven-day period that ended Monday, an average of 960 new cases were reported daily countywide, which pencils out to 67 cases a week for every 100,000 residents. That’s up 23% from the previous week, when L.A. County reported an average of 783 cases a day.
Caseloads of this magnitude remain a far cry from the tens of thousands of new infections that were being announced daily during the height of the Omicron surge. In mid-January, L.A. County was reporting as many as 42,000 new coronavirus cases a day.

A transgender psychologist reckons with how to support a new generation of trans teens
The parents come to Erica Anderson, 71, in part because she herself is transgender. Anderson also stands out because she is one of the few clinical psychologists specializing in transgender youth to publicly question the sharp rise in adolescents coming out as trans or nonbinary.
She has helped hundreds of teens transition. But she has also come to believe that some children identifying as trans are falling under the influence of their peers and social media and that some clinicians are failing to subject minors to rigorous mental health evaluations before recommending hormones or surgeries.
Her skepticism — and her willingness to speak directly to the public — puts her at the center of America’s culture war over trans kids. On the other side, trans activists want to tear down barriers to transitioning, with some accusing Anderson of having abandoned them.

The setting is a hospital ward. The bride wears a garland of pink-and-white blossoms and a short white dress with spaghetti straps and a flaring skirt. The groom, his dark hair cropped close, is in a blue T-shirt and dark trousers.
In the first, partial view of the two of them entwined, beginning their slow dance, it is not immediately obvious that she has no legs. Then, as they move fully into the frame, it becomes suddenly, shockingly clear that he is holding his new wife up entirely, cradling her as the white dress swirls around emptiness.
Ukraine has for weeks been following the story of this pair, who were married Monday in the Lviv Surgery Center in this western city, according to hospital officials.
News reports have detailed how Oksana Balandina, a 23-year-old nurse from Lysychansk, in the eastern province of Luhansk, lost her legs and four fingers March 27, a little more than a month into the war, in a land mine explosion. She stepped on some ordnance as she and her now-husband, construction worker Viktor Vasyliv, were walking home. He was unhurt, the news accounts said.
After initial treatment at a local hospital, involving several surgeries, Balandina was taken to the front-line city of Dnipro for more medical care that included preparation for prosthetics. A week ago, she and Vasyliv arrived in Lviv, a city less than 50 miles from the Polish border that comes under occasional attack but has largely served as a haven for those fleeing violence elsewhere.

If Kharkiv has been a target since Russia invaded Ukraine, then the district of Saltivka is the bull’s-eye, which diehard residents refuse to leave.

There are no reliable figures on the number of people killed and maimed in this war, now in its third month. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had confirmed 2,899 civilian deaths as of Thursday, 210 of them children, and 3,235 people injured. As always, the office emphasized that the true numbers were likely higher.
Individual places are thought to account for many times that official total; in the besieged port city of Mariupol, municipal authorities have said an estimated 20,000 people have died. Satellite imagery has detected what appear to be at least three mass graves on the outskirts of the city, which is largely cut off from the outside world.

Through it all, Ukrainian couples still marry, though forgoing the customary large nuptial gatherings. Most plan to do their celebrating once the war is over.
Balandina and Vasyliv are a longtime couple with two children who had already had a common-law marriage before Monday’s civil ceremony at the Lviv Surgery Center. There were no family members present — just patients and volunteers.

Landmark church is a lodestar as Ukrainians mourn war dead and pray for living soldiers: ‘Here, we are all together,’ chaplain says.


“You can’t postpone living,” said the Facebook post that accompanied the video.
In the 49-second video, posted by the hospital on social media with the couple’s permission, the two dance to slow guitar music. Her arms encircle his neck, and her bandaged left hand rests on his shoulder blade. Onlookers clap from their wheelchairs.
The newlyweds sway together, faces buried in each other’s neck. At one point, what sounds like a heavy sigh escapes the groom.
Someone keeps up a cheerful narration, exclaiming: “First dance!” He kisses her lightly, and the onlookers, wanting more, chant a traditional local wedding toast: “Bitter! Bitter!” — a nod to the maxim that, if something is bitter, a kiss will sweeten it. So they kiss again, first hesitantly, then deeply.
All the while clinging to each other, as the music plays on."

Their dwelling for now is a huge convention center in Poland’s capital. Savyichkina said she saw a photo of the home in Mariupol destroyed. From a camp bed in a foreign country, the 40-year-old bookkeeper thinks about restarting her and her children’s lives from square one.
“I don’t even know where we are going, how it will turn out,” Savyichkina said. “I would like to go home, of course. Maybe here, I will enjoy it in Poland.”
With the war in Ukraine approaching eight weeks, more than 5 million people have fled the country since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24, the U.N. refugee agency reported Wednesday. When the number reached 4 million on March 30, the exodus exceeded the worst-case predictions of the Geneva-based office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees.
The even bigger milestone in Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II was reached as Russia unleashed a full-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine that will disrupt and end more lives.
The millions of people who left Ukraine because of the war “have left behind their homes and families,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted Wednesday. “Many would do anything, and some even risk going back, to see their loved ones. But every new attack shatters their hopes. Only an end to the war can pave the way for rebuilding their lives.”

Desperate defenders in Mariupol say they face their ‘last days, if not hours’ as Russia steps up attacks along a 300-mile front in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine had a prewar population of 44 million, and UNHCR says the conflict has displaced more than 7 million people within Ukraine along with the 5.03 million who had left as of Wednesday. According to the agency, another 13 million people are believed to be trapped in the war-affected areas of Ukraine.

“We’ve seen about a quarter of Ukraine’s population, more than 12 million people in total ... have been forced to flee their homes, so this is a staggering amount of people,” UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told the Associated Press.
More than half of the refugees, over 2.8 million, fled at least at first to Poland. They are eligible for national ID numbers that entitle them to work, to free healthcare, schooling and bonuses for families with children.
Although many of the refugees have stayed there, an unknown number have traveled on to other countries. Savyichkina said she is thinking about taking her daughters to Germany.

Ukraine says the decisive fight for the country’s east has begun as Russia mounts attacks in the Donbas region. Biden will confer with allies.

“We hope we can live there, send children to school, find work and start life from zero,” she said inside the vast premises of the Global EXPO Center in Warsaw, which is providing basic accommodations for about 800 refugees.
If “everything goes well, if the children like it first of all, then we will stay. If not ... ,” Savyichkina said.
Further south, Hungary has emerged as a major transit point for Ukrainian refugees. Out of more than 465,000 who arrived, some 16,400 have applied for protected status, meaning they want to stay. Many are members of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Ukraine.
Hungary’s government says it has provided around $8.7 million to several charitable organizations and is giving subsidies to companies that employ Ukrainians granted asylum.
In March, a non-governmental organization, Migration Aid, rented an entire five-story building in Budapest, a former workers’ hostel, to provide temporary accommodation for people escaping the war in Ukraine. It has helped some 4,000 refugees so far.
Tatiana Shulieva, 67, a retired epidemiologist who fled from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine and wants to travel on to Egypt, said the night she spent in the hostel was “like a fairytale” after having sheltered in a basement for weeks to escape constant shelling.

Neighboring Romania has received over 750,000 refugees from Ukraine. Oxana Cotus, who fled the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv with her four small children, initially decided to go to Denmark but ended up in Bucharest because she speaks Romanian and didn’t want to be far from Ukraine.
She praised the help she received from the International Red Cross in helping her relocate and get settled.
The European nations hosting refugees say they need international help to manage the challenge, especially now as Russia has intensified attacks in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.
“If we have a second wave of refugees, then a real problem will come because we are at capacity. We cannot accept more,” Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski told the AP.
About 300,000 war refugees are in the city of some 1.8 million, most of them staying in private homes, Trzaskowski said. Warsaw residents expected to host refugees for a few months, but not indefinitely, he said.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was in Lviv, Ukraine, on Tuesday, visiting a refugee center made of mobile modules that the governments of Ukraine and Poland jointly built to house displaced individuals who do not want to leave Ukraine.
Organizations for refugees say the best help would be for the war to stop.
“Unfortunately, without an immediate end to the fighting, the unspeakable suffering and mass displacement that we are seeing will only get worse,” UNHCR’s Mantoo said.
Data from Poland show that some 738,000 people have crossed back into Ukraine during the war. Some of them shuttle back and forth to do shopping in Poland, while others return to Ukraine to check on relatives and property, electing to either stay or depart again depending on what they find.
More than half of the refugees from Ukraine are children, according to UNHCR. Thousands of civilians, including children, have been killed or wounded in shelling and air strikes.
Mantoo called the “outpouring of support and the generosity” shown to arriving Ukrainian refugees has been “remarkable.”
“But what is important is that it is sustained and that it is channelled across to ensure that refugees are enabled to receive that support while the fighting continues, while they are unable to return home,” she said.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-04-21/biden-announces-another-800-million-in-ukraine-defense-aid;2022-04-21;Biden announces another $800 million in Ukraine defense aid - Los Angeles Times;"President Biden on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send Ukraine another $800 million in security assistance to help it stave off Russia’s renewed offensive in the country’s eastern Donbas region, sending a strong message to Moscow that the West intends to stay in the fight for as long as it takes.
The tranche of defense aid, which follows a similar $800-million package last week, will include more heavy artillery and offensive weaponry that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested as the war shifts into a ground conflict that could go on for months.
The package brings the total amount of U.S. defense assistance for Ukraine since the war began to $3.4 billion, a sign of the Biden administration’s desire to see the eastern European democracy survive Russia’s unprovoked assault.
“We’re not sitting on the funding that Congress has provided for Ukraine. We’re sending it directly to the front lines of freedom,” Biden said in a speech from the White House during which he also announced the U.S. would provide Ukraine with an additional $500 million in humanitarian aid. “We are in a critical window now of time when they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of war.”
Biden, who said the U.S. believes the besieged city of Mariupol has not completely fallen into Russian hands, spoke following a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal, who also met with congressional leaders Thursday.
Although Biden departed the White House shortly after announcing the additional Ukraine aid to embark on a two-day Pacific Northwest swing focused on domestic issues, the president’s remarks  made clear just how much the ongoing war continues to be a major focus for his administration, Congress and the country.
The latest military assistance, he said, includes “dozens” of howitzers and 144,000 rounds of ammunition for the long-range ground weapons, as well as more than 100 additional tactical drones.
Biden, however, said he’s “exhausted” his drawdown authority to approve more aid for Ukraine and planned to ask Congress next week to expand his ability to continue to send assistance. He also announced that the U.S. was banning any Russian ships from American ports.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be betting that the West will lose its focus and resolve as the war drags on and vowed that “we’re going to prove him wrong.”

He continued: “We will not lessen our resolve. We’re going to continue to stand with the brave and proud people of Ukraine. We will never fail in our determination to defend freedom and oppose tyranny. It’s as simple as that.”
Politics
Although the U.S. says it’s committed for the long haul, there’s no evidence it has a plan to shorten or help Ukraine in what’s shaping up to become a protracted conflict.

After responding initially to Putin’s invasion primarily with economic sanctions, which the U.S. and its NATO allies have continued to ratchet up, Biden and other NATO leaders have shown a growing willingness to arm Ukraine  as it has become clear the war could be a prolonged one.
“This is our responsibility, it seems to me,” he said. Asked how long the U.S. can realistically sustain Ukraine’s war, Biden said the U.S. and NATO can do it for “a long time” if the alliance remains unified in its response to Russian aggression.
Ukraine’s resilience in battle has come as something of a surprise, as has Zelensky’s remarkable effectiveness in using Western media to rally global support for his country’s cause. Zelensky’s efforts have prompted the leaders of the world’s largest democracies to back up their rhetoric with action.
Biden lauded the media for reporting from the front lines that has revealed countless atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, further hardening the West’s resolve; and he credited the Pentagon’s sharing of real-time intelligence with Ukraine’s military and other defense aid efforts that, for security reasons, have been kept under wraps.
“Sometimes you have to speak softly and carry a large Javelin,” Biden said, updating Teddy Roosevelt’s famed foreign policy maxim from more than a century ago.
World & Nation
Ukraine’s government rejected the Russian assertion of a complete takeover of the once-thriving coastal city, which has been nearly wiped out.

The new willingness to send Ukraine helicopters, drones and fighter jets marks a shift away from the West’s response in the war’s first month when the U.S. scotched a proposal to help facilitate the transfer of Soviet era MiG-29 jets from Poland to Ukraine out of concern that Putin would see the move as escalatory.
As the the U.S. and its allies have made the scope of their defense aid clearer in recent days, Putin on Wednesday delivered another ominous and explicit threat after testing a new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile, stating that it should give other countries “food for thought” about arming Ukraine.
Although Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, explaining that any direct engagement with Russia would lead to “World War III” with a nuclear power, the White House this week largely brushed off Putin’s missile test and comments as bluster.
“We did not deem the test a threat to the United States or its allies,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday. “And the timing of the scope of Russia’s missile tests do not influence our approach to countering Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine.”"

Along hundreds of miles of a scythe-shaped battlefront in Ukraine’s east, the din of Russian bombardment echoed in cities and towns, while Moscow’s ground forces made a series of what Ukrainian military officials described as probing attacks that did not yield any substantial new territorial gains.
With the war about to grind into a ninth week and Western powers racing to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the nation that nearly all of Russia’s combat-ready forces were “concentrated on the territory of our state” and just outside its borders. Moscow, he said, was deploying “almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting.”
Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of its smaller neighbor has triggered a refugee crisis on a scale not seen in Europe since World War II. The United Nations’ refugee agency Wednesday put the the number who have fled Ukraine at 5 million. More than 7 million people are internally displaced.

As investigators gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine, family members visit mass graves and claim their dead in suburbs of Kyiv.

As the fighting’s ferocity has increased — and in the weeks since gruesome evidence began emerging of Russian atrocities against civilians in the suburbs of Kyiv, the capital — diplomatic efforts have foundered. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed Ukraine for the impasse, saying that Moscow had sent Zelensky’s government a draft document with “absolutely clear” proposals and that Ukraine had not responded.
“The ball is in their court,” Peskov told reporters. In the past, Ukraine has accused Moscow of distorting what was said in negotiations.
Less than three weeks remain before May 9, Russia’s annual celebration of the historic victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be determined to notch a significant triumph by then in a military campaign in Ukraine that has been beset by setbacks for Moscow.

The Monday morning missile strike was another unnerving reminder that Kramatorsk is firmly in the firing line of advancing Russian forces. The battle for eastern Ukraine has begun.

The likeliest prospect of that is the capture of Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov that has been nearly wiped off the map by continuous Russian bombardment. In a message recorded deep within a sprawling steelworks plant where Ukrainian forces and some frightened civilians are holed up, a Ukrainian commander said the defenders were outnumbered 10 to 1 by Russian attackers.
“We are probably facing our last days, if not hours,” the officer, Serhiy Volnya of the 36th marine brigade, said in the video, which was posted on Facebook. He pleaded with world leaders to arrange for Ukrainian forces remaining in the steel plant and its underground tunnels to be evacuated and taken “to the territory of a third-party state.”
Russia has been dropping heavy bombs on the steel complex even as it issues repeated surrender demands, promising that holdouts who give up would be unharmed. But previous ultimatums, on Sunday and Tuesday, were ignored by the Ukrainian side, as was Wednesday’s. Ukraine says a Mariupol hospital where hundreds of civilians had taken shelter was also targeted Wednesday.
Officials have tried to arrange the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents who remain trapped in the city under dire conditions, without access to drinking water, food or medical supplies.
Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said that a plan to rescue civilians from Mariupol via a humanitarian corridor “did not work as planned” Wednesday and that another attempt would be made Thursday. “Due to the lack of control over their own military at the place, the occupiers were unable to ensure a proper cease-fire,” she said of Russia.
Mariupol, a once-thriving city of nearly half a million people, now lies in ruins, with three-quarters of its prewar population either displaced or dead. Still, it is considered a strategic prize. Capturing it would allow the creation of a land corridor linking Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas — Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland — to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed eight years ago.

Family and attorneys recall the difficulty of finding and communicating with people in immigration custody.

While Russia was focusing its “main effort” on capturing Mariupol, the Ukrainian military said Moscow’s forces were also making repeated thrusts in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the Donbas. Ten Russian ground attacks were repulsed in the previous 24 hours, the military said in an operational report early Wednesday.
Since both sides declared Monday that the war had entered a new phase, Russian forces have captured Kreminna, an eastern town of about 18,000 people on the front lines.
Nearby, the city of Rubizhne was the site of intense artillery fusillades.
Shelling had devastated wide parts of the city, turning Rubizhne into a landscape of smashed, scorched buildings and cratered boulevards.
Russian forces had reportedly taken much of the city, but on Wednesday, street battles were ongoing, with an especially intense skirmish around the train station.
Although some Western officials and analysts have questioned whether the Russian offensive in the east was underway in earnest, British military intelligence said in a new assessment that fighting in the Donbas was growing in intensity, with Russian forces seeking to break through Ukrainian defenses and disrupt supply lines and troop redeployment on the Ukrainian side.
“Russian attacks on cities across Ukraine show their attempt to try and disrupt the movement of Ukrainian reinforcements and weaponry to the east of the country,” the assessment said.
Supply and reinforcement, combined with serious morale problems, were key weaknesses in Russia’s drive to capture Kyiv, an effort that Moscow abandoned a month ago. Analysts say those same issues could beset Moscow’s efforts in the east as well.
But vast tracts of open territory and superior firepower could favor the Russian push in the east — the main reason that Zelensky has been making near-daily pleas for more heavy weaponry from the West.
“If we had access to all the weapons we need, which our partners have and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war,” he said in his address.

Photojournalist Carolyn Cole documents Ukrainian life amid Russia’s invasion.

The United States, Canada and Britain have promised Ukraine more artillery, and Norway is sending air-defense missiles. In addition to new sanctions on Russia that the White House says are in the works, President Biden is expected to announce a new military aid package for Kyiv in coming days.
Some allied countries, including Germany, have been name-checked by Ukrainian officials as flagging in their provision of armaments just when the need is greatest. Seemingly stung by the criticism, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday cited recent shipments of antitank weapons and Stinger antiaircraft missiles to Ukraine.
Baerbock, speaking at the start of a visit to the three Baltic states, said Germany was also providing “other things that we didn’t talk about in public.”
Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry released footage Wednesday showing the test launch of what it described as a powerful new missile that could deploy nuclear warheads at supersonic speeds. The missile is still in a trial phase, the ministry said, and would not be added to Russia’s arsenal immediately. Still, Putin said the test launch should show Russia’s enemies that they should “think twice” before threatening his country.
In the Ukrainian capital, Western VIPs continued to arrive despite renewed bombardment in recent days. Charles Michel, head of the European Council, on Wednesday became the latest senior European official to make a visit to Kyiv aimed at showing support for Ukraine.
After touring Borodyanka, a suburb of the capital that was heavily bombed, Michel wrote on Twitter: “These are atrocities. These are war crimes. They must be punished.”

It’s Thursday, March 31. I’m Justin Ray.
Even though Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is taking place thousands of miles away from California, it is still affecting the Golden State — and not just through rising gas prices; a Ukrainian bakery in San Diego has received an outpouring of support.
Daria Nadar, owner of Oh My Cake bakery in the Hillcrest neighborhood, says that at the start of the invasion, members of the community immediately reached out to see if her family was safe. But  they were not; her loved ones were at the center of the war zone in Kyiv.
“I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t believe this is happening,” Nadar told me. She asked herself, “What on Earth is going on in the middle of Europe?”
But she decided that she wouldn’t sit idly by as the battle progressed. Recognizing that she has a business that could provide both financial support and awareness, she began raising funds for Ukraine, donating 25% of her profits to help those in her home country. She drummed up support for the donation drive through the shop’s Instagram account.
“Since I started the fundraising with my bakery, a lot of people didn’t just come to eat a cake, but also they donated cash,” Nadar said. “I’ve been able to send out over $10,000 in support of the army and humanitarian help.”
She has been shocked by the help from her community, but handling demand hasn’t been easy. She runs her shop with  two other women. She says it has been “really intense” trying to keep her pastries and cakes in stock. “I would restock and then two hours and nothing is on the shelves anymore,” she said.
The California Assembly sent the bakery a certificate of recognition that reads:
“On behalf of the California State Assembly, thank you for your dedication, humanitarianism, and continued service to our Ukrainian friends and allies. The 78th Assembly District and the State of California are sincerely grateful for your compassion and commitment to upholding the values of our communities and two nations.”

How Oh My Cake began
It’s a lot of success for someone who moved to San Diego only six years ago. Her path to Oh My Cake began when the pandemic started. She had just gotten married and was looking for work but wasn’t finding a lot of opportunities. So she began making cakes and posting on social media, where crowds complimented her cake-making capabilities.
“The cakes I made were nothing like cakes you can find in San Diego. They were European mousse cakes that are really different from the cakes that you see. And people got interested in it,” Nadar said. “Basically, I kind of became a bit of a trendsetter for those types of cakes that we have in our store right now.”
She began making cinnamon buns because her husband really wanted them and couldn’t find them anywhere nearby. (“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I really don’t want to bake anything that’s like buns or whatever, but OK, I’ll make it for you,’” Nadar said, relating a conversation with her husband.) She began selling those cinnamon buns through pop-up stores and they were a big hit, selling out within an hour or two. One of her pop-ups was inside a coffee shop, a building where she now has a permanent location.
When asked why she called the shop Oh My Cake, Nadar says, “I don’t know, I feel like every time I like something I eat, I would say, ‘Oh my God, it’s so good.’ And then I was like, ‘Oh my cake’ — it’s almost like, ‘Oh my God,’ but ‘Oh, my cake’ is just so good, so amazing. You just have to buy it, or you just have to eat it, you know?”
She’s happy that her family has since left Kyiv, but she won’t be satisfied until the war is over because she thinks of everyone in Ukraine as a loved one. “I’m praying for my country and for my people every single day,” Nadar said. “I’m trying to support. I’m just trying to do whatever I can.”

Today’s California memory is from Royce Philip Bell. It is a revealing one!
I suppose, now 54 years married, I can safely confess: My wife was not the first girl I kissed. The first was in San Diego; I was in the first grade at Sherman Elementary, the state was taking the property on which my dad’s church was located (18th & G streets), and my family was moving to La Mesa. I don’t remember her name, but she was a lovely redhead and I kissed her under one of those fantastic exterior staircases so prevalent in 1954. Then, in 1956, we moved to Midland, Texas; third grade, where I met my (now) wife — who was not the first girl I kissed.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-04-20/wimbledon-bans-players-from-russia-belarus-over-ukraine-war;2022-04-20;Wimbledon bans players from Russia, Belarus over Ukraine war - Los Angeles Times;"Tennis players from Russia and Belarus will not be allowed to play at Wimbledon this year because of the war in Ukraine, the All England Club announced Wednesday.
Among the prominent men’s players affected by the ban are reigning U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who recently reached No. 1 in the ATP rankings and is currently No. 2, and No. 8 Andrey Rublev. The women’s players affected include No. 4 Aryna Sabalenka, who was a Wimbledon semifinalist last year; Victoria Azarenka, a former No. 1 who has won the Australian Open twice; and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the French Open runner-up last year.
Medvedev, Rublev and Pavlyuchenkova are from Russia; Sabalenka and Azarenka are from Belarus.
Wimbledon begins  June 27. The All England Club confirmed in March that it was having discussions with the British government about whether Russians should be able to play in the grass-court Grand Slam tournament.
“It is our responsibility to play our part in the widespread efforts to limit Russia’s global influence through the strongest means possible,” the All England Club said in a statement first posted on Twitter. “In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with The Championships.”
Russian athletes have been prevented from competing in many sports following their country’s invasion of Ukraine. Belarus has aided Russia in the war.
Soccer, figure skating and track and field all banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams from their events because of the war. The Russian men’s national soccer team was excluded from last month’s World Cup qualifying playoffs, forcing them to miss a chance to reach this year’s tournament in Qatar.
Wednesday’s move signals the first time a tennis tournament has told players from Russia and Belarus they are not welcome — and the ATP was quick to criticize the All England Club for what the men’s tennis tour called a “unilateral decision” and “unfair.”

“Our sport is proud to operate on the fundamental principles of merit and fairness, where players compete as individuals to earn their place in tournaments,” the ATP said in a statement, adding that the decision “has the potential to set a damaging precedent for the game.”
The WTA also said it was “very disappointed” with the decision.

Jordan Spieth makes a clutch shot out of a bunker to set up a tap-in Sunday and defeat Patrick Cantlay on the first playoff hole at the RBC Heritage.


“As the WTA has consistently stated, individual athletes should not be penalized or prevented from competing due to where they are from, or the decisions made by the governments of their countries,” the women’s tour said in a statement. “The WTA will be evaluating its next steps and what actions may be taken regarding these decisions.”
The seven groups that run the sport around the world decided March 1 that players from those countries would be allowed to compete in WTA, ATP and Grand Slam tournaments but not under the name or flag of Russia or Belarus. Those two nations also were kicked out of the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup team competitions; Russia had been the reigning champion in both.
The French Open, which starts on May 22, will be the first Grand Slam tournament held since Russia invaded Ukraine in February and is expected to permit Russian and Belarusian players to compete — just as so-called neutral athletes who may not represent their countries.
The U.S. Tennis Assn., which runs the U.S. Open, said Wednesday it has not made a decision about whether players from Russia and Belarus can compete at the year’s last Grand Slam tournament, which begins on Aug. 29.
The All England Club said that if “circumstances change materially between now and June,” it would “respond accordingly.”
“We recognize that this is hard on the individuals affected, and it is with sadness that they will suffer for the actions of the leaders of the Russian regime,“ All England Club chairman Ian Hewitt said.
“We have very carefully considered the alternative measures that might be taken within the UK government guidance but, given the high profile environment of the Championships, the importance of not allowing sport to be used to promote the Russian regime and our broader concerns for public and player {including family) safety, we do not believe it is viable to proceed on any other basis at the Championships.”
Some current and former tennis players from Ukraine — including two-time Grand Slam semifinalist Elina Svitolina and the recently retired Sergiy Stakhovsky — put up a statement on Twitter on Wednesday that called on the WTA, ATP and International Tennis Federation to ask players representing Russia and Belarus whether they support the invasion of Ukraine.
“In times of crisis, silence means agreeing with what is happening,” the posts said. “We noticed that some Russian and Belarusian players at some point vaguely mentioned the war, but never clearly stating that Russia and Belarus started it on the territory of Ukraine.”"

Hello, it’s Tuesday, April 19, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Russian forces launch a ground assault in eastern Ukraine
Ukrainian officials said that Russia began its long-anticipated assault to seize control of their country’s eastern industrial heartland, launching a ground assault along a nearly 300-mile front while pounding the nation, including the western city of Lviv, with a deadly barrage of missile strikes.
In a new and potentially pivotal stage of the war focused on Ukraine’s vast rural flatlands, Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses along a broad front line in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on Ukrainian television.

Homeless advocates lash out at Newsom’s plan for court-ordered treatment
Six weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a far-reaching effort to push more people into court-ordered treatment for severe mental illness and addiction, critics have called it misguided and immoral, and the proposal’s first public hearing in the state Capitol has been pushed back to the last possible day for legislative action.

More than three dozen organizations signed an opposition letter raising serious concerns with Assembly Bill 2830, one of two identical measures moving through the Legislature to implement Newsom’s Community Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment Court.
Newsom touted the CARE Court framework as an innovative strategy to guide an estimated 7,000 to 12,000 people into housing and much-needed treatment. Under the proposal, family members, behavioral health providers and first responders, among others, could petition a civil judge to initiate a CARE plan for eligible individuals who lack medical decision-making capacity.

Cases against LAPD officers accused of making false gang claims fall apart
When Los Angeles police officers were accused two years ago of deliberately misidentifying people as gang members, the fallout was swift and sweeping. Six officers were charged with crimes and police officials opened investigations into two dozen more. Prosecutors also dismissed felony cases that had relied on testimony from the charged officers.
In the years since, however, the case has largely fallen apart. Charges against three officers have been tossed out, while prosecutors have decided there isn’t enough evidence to bring cases against the other officers suspected of possible wrongdoing. And the L.A. district attorney’s office is now reconsidering whether to press ahead with the charges that prosecutors filed in the few cases that remain active, according to district attorney’s records reviewed by The Times.
Some California transit agencies ask riders to still wear masks
Some public transit agencies in California are asking riders to continue wearing masks on buses and trains, despite a federal court ruling in Florida that struck down the masking mandate on public transportation.
The Biden administration said the court decision means that the federal order issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requiring mask use on public transit is not in effect at this time. The CDC still recommends the public wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. Several airlines quickly announced they would drop mandates.
Meanwhile, California transit agencies scrambled to formulate messages on mask-wearing guidance and requirements on their transit systems.

Angelenos are alarmed by air pollution and extreme heat
Los Angeles voters are alarmed by deadly heat waves, destructive wildfires and dangerous air pollution — and they want politicians to take major steps to reduce the city’s reliance on fossil fuels and prepare for a hotter future.
Nearly two-thirds of L.A. voters say extreme heat poses a serious threat to their health and safety, according to a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times. Eight in 10 voters say the same about air pollution, which, like global warming, is caused largely by dirty fuels such as oil and natural gas.
Statewide, voters also support big changes to cope with the effects of climate change. About two-thirds would back restrictions on building housing in high-risk wildfire areas, the poll found.

What does L.A. really smell like? Louis Vuitton’s new fragrance, City of Stars, is the latest attempt to bottle up Los Angeles — the idea of it and what it inspires. It does not smell like structural failures. Nor does it smell like a romanticized night of bad decisions. There are no hints of bacon-wrapped hot dog topped with grilled onions and peppers, no traces of burnt air from fireworks. The Times’ Julissa James found it more aspirational, idealized, sanitized, but essential nonetheless — and thought provoking, for good measure.
Los Angeles is such an expanse of diverse geographies, microclimates, neighbors, businesses, cultures; the city smells like a lot of different things, at different times, in different places, to different people. Its smell could include notes of cigarette smoke; late-night Korean barbecue; the polarizing stench of Le Labo Santal 33; walking home through the Flower District after a night out. Or maybe an L.A. fragrance becomes an L.A. fragrance when someone who lives in L.A. wears it.

It was 66 years ago this month when American movie star-glamour queen Grace Kelly married the dashing Prince Rainier of Monaco.
Rainier and Kelly’s marriage was one of the most publicized events of the 20th century. It was said to be love at first sight. But it was not an easy marriage, and it happened only after hard negotiation.
Rainier needed a wife who could have children because, under a 1918 treaty with Paris, the principality would revert to France if his bloodline died out. He demanded that Kelly submit to an examination by his physician to prove that she was capable of bearing him an heir.
Also, showing the shrewdness in business for which he would become known, the prince asked Jack Kelly to give him a $2-million dowry — in advance. The construction magnate reportedly balked, so the bride-to-be ended up paying half, according to several biographies of Kelly.

Hello, it’s Friday, March 11, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
As Ukraine-Russia talks falter, battles continue in Kyiv suburbs
As Russian troops advanced from the north, Kyiv with its defiant president and citizen militias armed with rifles and homemade bombs was preparing a robust defense as talks to end the war stalled and relentless shelling battered coastal towns in the south.
While the clashes and efforts to evacuate more people continued, there were no breakthroughs for an end to the hostilities as Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in Antalya, Turkey, for the two countries’ highest-level talks since the war began two weeks ago.
After negotiations lasting about an hour and a half, the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers emerged still far apart in their views of a conflict that has killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of people.

Inflation rose again in February and is probably headed higher

In a development that cast a dark shadow over an otherwise strong economy, inflation surged in February to a new four-decade high. The rise in inflation will probably be exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine, which already has pushed gas prices higher.
Although overshadowed in a news cycle dominated by reports from the war front, rising costs remain a top issue in the U.S. as the White House has worked to blunt Republican attacks on the Biden administration’s failure to tame inflation.
Biden suggested in a statement that the February report “is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the impacts of Putin’s price hike.”
How will L.A. County find warning signs of the next COVID-19 surge?
As the Omicron surge of the coronavirus continues to wane, Los Angeles County has been lifting COVID-19 mandates, including indoor masking and vaccine verification in certain settings. But with those guardrails removed, how will health officials detect signs of potential surges?
The obvious tools of tracking new coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations are still in place. But there are seven other indicators that L.A. County plans to monitor as part of an early warning system, according to Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. Among these include new variants, the percentage of coronavirus-related emergency room visits and the case rate for the county’s lowest-income areas.

MLB lockout is set to end with an agreement to new contract terms
Baseball’s spring finally has dawned. Three months after major league owners locked out players and declared not another game would be played without a new collective bargaining agreement, the league and the players’ union agreed on the outline of a five-year deal.
The deal includes a full 162-game season this year, starting April 7.
The deal was ratified by the players and still must be by owners, but the news sparked an immediate scramble for teams to open training camps and players to get there. Major league camps had been set to open the week of Feb. 14, and exhibition games had been scheduled to start Feb. 26.
As a med student, he saw women nearly die from illegal abortions. At 83, he sees no end to his work
Dr. Warren Hern doesn’t have to imagine what could befall many women in America if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe vs. Wade. In 1963, he was a medical student working nights at Colorado General Hospital in Denver. Women would arrive in septic shock, some probably hours from death.
Hern had found his calling: ensuring access to legal abortions, a mission he believes is worth dying for, as several of his friends have. With the court expected to deliver a ruling in the next few months that could trigger abortion bans in as many as 26 states, Hern has recommitted himself to his life’s work at the center of one of the most contentious debates in American political history.

On March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam failed, unleashing a wave of devastation that smashed bridges, washed away homes and killed at least 450 people. The dam, in San Francisquito Canyon, about 20 miles north of what is now the city of Santa Clarita, broke apart just before midnight, sending 12 billion gallons of water rampaging through communities in the Santa Clara River Valley — “a flood not just of water but of concrete, asphalt, railroad rails and ties, farms, cars and homes.” It raged for hours toward the coast.
Named as heroes in the tragedy were telephone operators, later called “Hello Girls,” who stayed at their posts and “began systematically calling residents in low-lying areas, urging them to flee to higher ground,” according to KCET. The Times reported on March 19, 1928: “The lights were out and candles had been lit when first word of the flood reached Miss Louise Gipe, a night operator in Santa Paula. She called the Chief of Police at Santa Paula. She called the Sheriff at Ventura. And then remained at her post calling the operators of other stations in the valley. What Miss Gipe did was repeated by others.”

It’s Thursday, Feb. 24. I’m Justin Ray.
Yesterday,  Russia’s intention to escalate its invasion of Ukraine became clear. Soon after Vladimir Putin announced late Wednesday that he would proceed with a military operation, loud explosions were heard outside Kyiv.
It’s not every day that Russia impacts  life in California, but I bet you have already noticed how the conflict is impacting the state’s residents.
“The average price paid for a gallon of regular gas across California hit a record high of $4.742 on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Assn. That figure is the highest in the country and more than $1 higher than the national average, which currently sits at $3.531 a gallon,” The Times reported.
Unfortunately, things may get worse; some forecasters  expect the average price to top $5 a gallon in the near future.
You might be wondering why the Russia-Ukraine conflict is raising gas prices for the state. Here’s what you should know.
Why the latest conflict impacts Golden State gas prices
Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of petroleum and other crude oil, 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. As you may have heard, President  Biden recently announced sanctions on Russia by the U.S. and Europe. Some fear these steps could cause those  energy exports to drop.
“As we respond, my administration is using every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers from rising prices at the pump,”  Biden said in an address Tuesday announcing the sanctions. “As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home. We need to be honest about that.”
California actually doesn’t import any oil from Russia. As of 2020, the state received 24% of its oil from Ecuador, 23% from Saudi Arabia and 20% from Iraq, according to the California Energy Commission.

But that’s how tricky the geopolitical logistics are. The loss of such a major exporter would  shrink global supplies, which could affect the retail price in California.
Our state has also become more and more dependent on oil imports as we try to move away from fracking, making us more vulnerable to external price swings.

Column: Where’s the love? Here’s why Kamala Harris’ California poll numbers stink.

All five  supervisors said they did not find out about Mase’s arrest and conviction until the paper began reporting the story last week. Santa Rosa Press Democrat

Individuals who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to shed their masks in certain indoor settings in Los Angeles County starting later this week, health officials said Wednesday. Unvaccinated individuals would still need to wear masks indoors. That rule is in place statewide. And places without vaccine verification will remain subject to the county’s standing indoor mask mandate, which applies to all residents regardless of vaccination status. Los Angeles Times
Will you need a fourth shot to keep coronavirus at bay? With Omicron fading and pressure growing to ease mask rules and other pandemic restrictions, there is growing debate among health officials and experts about if or when a second booster shot will be part of  the path toward recovery. Here’s what experts say. Los Angeles Times

Mechanical issues were reported shortly before a police helicopter crashed into the ocean along a California coastline. The Feb. 19 incident claimed the life of a Huntington Beach police officer and sent another to the hospital. “Right now, it appears to be a nose-down descent into the water,” NTSB spokesperson Elliott Simpson previously said.

Inside California’s cannabis crisis. It is well-known that California has an enormous marijuana market, which reached an estimated $4.4 billion in sales in 2020. But the industry has many issues; small weed farmers are struggling with oppressive regulations, high taxing and bureaucracy. “I have to leave home for periods of time because our farm isn’t gonna make it. I come back and I take all the money I’ve earned to pay taxes and fees on cannabis, because it’s not even paying for itself, you know? So it’s pretty depressing,” one Northern California farmer told the reporter, who happens to be named Mary Jane Gibson. Rolling Stone

Today’s California memory is from Bonnie St. James:
When I was 11 years old in 1962 my family moved from Tucson to Buena Park.  It was all dairy farms, strawberry fields and orange groves. Orange County! I loved the smell of the country, orange blossoms and also the cows at our neighboring dairy farm.  So for Christmas my beloved brothers filled a shoebox with cow manure, wrapped it up in Christmas wrap and a bow and gave it to me for Christmas! In the 6th grade my best friend Brenda and I would walk a mile to school past the farmlands on the highway, with the big produce trucks barreling down the road. We loved to do a two arm pump to get the truck drivers to honk their horns for us! We would also walk to Knott’s Berry Farm where there were no fences, no admission fees and we could just walk around, look at boys, and watch the gunfights in the street and the dancehall girls dance on the bars. Innocent times at only 12 years old.

Speaking from neighboring Poland, Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said in a statement that Ukraine needed the West’s assistance to deal with the “devastating human toll taken on the Ukrainian people by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s diabolic invasion.”
In the port city of Mariupol, which Russian forces have battered with missiles almost daily for several weeks, about 100 civilians were being evacuated Sunday from a sprawling steel plant that is a final redoubt of Ukrainian defenders and hundreds of noncombatants. Zelensky’s office confirmed the evacuation, but gave few details.
At the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed sorrow over the city’s plight, saying its people had suffered “barbarously” during the weeks-long Russian siege.
“I suffer and cry thinking of the suffering of the Ukrainian population, in particular the weakest, the elderly, the children,” Francis said.
Russian officials said Sunday their military struck 800 targets with missile and artillery fire overnight and early in the day, marking an intensified battle tempo along a crescent-shaped front line stretching 300 miles from southeast to northeast in a 10th week of warfare.
The number of strikes could not be independently confirmed, but Ukrainian officials acknowledged intensified shelling in a number of areas.
Moscow, which has signaled wider ambitions to seize the entirety of Ukraine’s southern Black Sea coast and render the country landlocked, confirmed it had taken aim a day earlier at the airport outside the major port city of Odesa. Ukrainian officials had said those strikes on Saturday left the airport inoperable.

Russia’s Defense Ministry routinely describes its targets as military ones, but at least two Ukrainian regional governors depicted the brunt of the latest carnage as falling on civilians.
Oleh Sinegubov, the governor of the Kharkiv  region,  on Sunday used the Telegram messaging app to urge civilians to stay in shelters because shelling was so intense. Serhiy Haidai, head of the regional military administration in Luhansk — one of the two provinces making up the Donbas, the industrial heartland Russia covets — begged people to flee while they still could.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
Pelosi, the highest ranking U.S. official to travel to the country since the war began in February, made a three-hour stop on Saturday evening in Kyiv, as Ukrainian forces defended the country. Zelensky placed his hand on his heart as he greeted the speaker, who was accompanied by a congressional delegation that included Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank).
In a video released by the Ukrainian president Sunday, Pelosi could be seen walking outdoors among a phalanx of Ukrainian officials and armed guards.
Zelensky in recent weeks has received a parade of Western officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III a week ago. Pelosi is the next in line of succession to the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris.
The Ukrainian capital was menaced in the war’s first weeks by heavy bombardment and an enormous column of Russian armored vehicles, but Moscow broke off the attack early last month and turned its attention to Ukraine’s south and east.

Zelensky, in  an overnight address over the weekend, accused the Kremlin of cynically preparing conscript soldiers as cannon fodder for the next phase of fighting in the east.
World & Nation
A series of factors helped pave the way for former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed’s release this week as part of a prisoner exchange, at an unlikely time in Washington-Moscow relations.
“The Russian command is well aware that thousands more Russian soldiers will be killed and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks,” he said.
Summing up Ukraine’s resistance to the Russian invasion in numerical terms, Zelensky said that since the attack began Feb. 24, Ukrainian forces have destroyed an estimated 1,000 Russian tanks, 2,500 armored vehicles and nearly 200 aircraft. Some 23,000 Russian troops have been killed, he said. None of those figures could be independently confirmed.
Even after Russia broke off its effort to seize Kyiv, the capital has come under sporadic bombardment, including Russian strikes staged last week while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the city to meet with Zelensky. That attack drew widespread international condemnation, and the Ukrainian president described it as intended to humiliate the world body.
In the suburbs of Kyiv, hundreds of civilians were found dead after Russia’s occupation of the area in what Ukrainian and  Western allies have described as war crimes.
For security reasons, Pelosi’s three-hour visit was not announced in advance. A week ago, Zelensky caught U.S. officials by surprise when he spoke publicly about the planned Blinken-Austin visit hours before it had taken place.
This time, Zelensky’s office posted the video of Pelosi’s visit online only after she and the delegation had departed the country.
Pelosi tweeted afterward that the delegation’s message to Zelensky, who has won wide acclaim for his wartime leadership, was that “we are here until victory is won.” Ukraine’s fight, she said, was being waged on behalf of democracies everywhere.
Politics
If he fears a humiliating loss, Putin could order the use of a small-scale nuclear weapon against Ukraine.

“We are visiting you to say ‘thank you’ for your fight for freedom, that we’re on a frontier for freedom, and that your fight is a fight for everyone,” Pelosi said while in Kyiv. “And so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.”
Joining Pelosi in Kyiv were Schiff, who heads the House Intelligence Committee; Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee; Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.); and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.).
“We had one purpose: to reinforce our commitment to our allies,” Schiff said on Twitter.
The delegation, which also held talks with senior Polish officials including President Andrzej Duda, traveled Sunday to Rzeszow, in southeastern Poland, for a briefing on the refugee crisis fueled by the war. Poland has been a main transit point for arms being shipped to Ukraine, and also has taken in the largest share of the more than 5.4 million people who have fled fighting in Ukraine.
At a news conference in Rzeszow, Pelosi said the West should not be deterred by Kremlin threats.
“Do not be bullied by bullies,” she said. “If they are making threats, you cannot back down.”
Crow, a former Army Ranger, summed up the trip’s primary purpose as “weapons, weapons and weapons.”
Zelensky has thanked the Biden administration and other Western governments for providing heavy armaments for the battle in the east, but says more will be needed as the fighting begins in earnest.
Last week, President Biden asked Congress for an additional $33 billion to support Ukraine in its defense from Russia’s invasion and for the authority to make it easier to seize and sell the assets of Russian oligarchs, vowing anew that the U.S. was committed to ensuring Ukraine’s victory in a war likely to drag on for months.
On Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed confidence that a new aid package for Ukraine could quickly pass through Congress.
“I don’t think we have a lot of time to waste in Congress,” McCaul said on ABC’s “This Week.”
“Every day we don’t send [Ukraine] more weapons is a day where more people will be killed and a day where they could lose this war,” McCaul said. “I think they can win it. But we have to give them the tools to do it.”

Putin said there was “no doubt” Moscow would achieve its aims to protect Russian security and, blaming Ukraine, said talks between the two sides had reached a “dead end.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in turn, rejected the idea that Russia’s nearly 7-week-old invasion, plagued by logistical and supply problems, was going according to plan after Russian troops’ withdrawal from the capital, Kyiv.
“The Russian army has reached a level of irreparable losses higher than that of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan,” he said in an evening broadcast to the Ukrainian people. “Higher than that of Russia in the two wars in Chechnya.”

Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian negotiator and presidential advisor, said in a statement that negotiations were difficult “but they are ongoing.”

After failing to capture the capital, Russia  was attempting to regroup and redeploy its forces in preparation for an all-out assault in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, the  Ukrainian military said in its latest operational report. It also said Ukraine had thwarted half a dozen Russian attacks in the previous 24 hours in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
World & Nation
The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was under Russian siege and bombardment for 38 days

In devastated outlying areas of Kyiv that endured a monthlong Russian occupation, investigators and Ukrainian troops moved ahead with the bleak and dangerous task of recovering the bodies of civilians and clearing away ordnance left behind in houses and garden sheds, in buildings and on streets, some even rigged on corpses.
Zelensky excoriated Russian troops for trying to inflict new carnage even after their departure.

Once-placid suburbs and satellite towns near the capital were now filled with “shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines,” the Ukrainian leader said Monday night, adding that the Russian forces “consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after de-occupation as dangerous as possible.”
According to the   Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, more than 1,890 civilians, including 153 children, have been killed.
Russia has denied committing atrocities against civilians, but the cleanup crews continued to gather additional evidence of horrific abuses. A senior U.N. official, Sima Bahous, told the Security Council on Monday  that “brutality” against civilians must also be independently investigated, including emerging evidence of execution-style killings and rapes.
On Tuesday, President Biden said Russian actions amounted to “genocide,” a term the administration has previously avoided using to describe atrocities uncovered in Ukraine.
“Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said during a speech in Menlo, Iowa, on rising gas prices.
Later, Biden told reporters he used the term genocide because “it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out even the idea of being ... Ukrainian.”
“The evidence is mounting,” he said. “We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.”
Until now, the Biden administration has accused Putin and Russian troops of war crimes, but held back from declaring their actions to be genocide.
“We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide,” national security advisor Jake Sullivan said last week.
Zelensky was quick to praise Biden as a “true leader” for his shift in rhetoric.
“Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,” he said in a post on Twitter late Tuesday.
With Russian forces moving into place for a wide-ranging offensive in the east, Ukrainian officials redoubled pleas on Tuesday for civilians to flee while they are still able. On the Telegram messaging app, Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said bodies of civilians filled the morgues in several cities and burials were not possible because of shelling near cemeteries. In another post, he implored people to use five agreed-on humanitarian corridors to leave the area rather than “burn in your sleep” from Russian shelling.
In Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, defenders were continuing to “heroically hold” their positions, the Ukrainian army’s general staff wrote Tuesday on Telegram, a day after a besieged marine unit in the city posted on Facebook that it was running low on ammunition and that the situation was dire.
“Our soldiers remain trapped in the city and have problems with supplies,” Podolyak posted Tuesday on Twitter. “The president and the leadership of the armed forces are doing everything possible (and impossible) to find a solution and help our soldiers.”
John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said it was not inevitable that the southern port would fall to the Russians.
“Our assessment today is that Mariupol is still contested and that the Ukrainians are still fighting to defend Mariupol from the Russian seizure of it,” Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing Tuesday.
Capturing Mariupol would be a significant prize for Russia, because it would allow creation of a land corridor between Russian-controlled territory and the Crimean peninsula, seized by Moscow eight years ago.
Kirby said Mariupol would provide the Russians “unfettered and unhindered land access between the Donbas and Crimea.” But he also stressed that the city was important for Ukraine, because of what it represents to the country’s economic life.
“They haven’t given up on it,” he said. “And we’re not giving up on them either.”
Western and Ukrainian military officials said Tuesday that they were trying to ascertain whether Russia had used or intended to use chemical weapons in a bid to subdue Mariupol. Zelensky said he was paying “great attention” to reports of a projectile with a poisonous substance, but the Russian bombardment made it “impossible to conduct a full investigation and full analysis.”
In a seeming scale-back on the threat of using chemical weapons, a spokesman for Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east — who had said Monday on Russian state television that such munitions would be used against Ukrainian forces in Mariupol — said Tuesday that it had not engaged in such tactics. The spokesman, Eduard Basurin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying separatists “haven’t used any chemical weapons in Mariupol.”

On Monday night, Zelensky said without mentioning Basurin by name that the earlier statement “testifies to [Russia’s] preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders.” One senior British defense official said Tuesday that if chemical weapons were in fact used by Russian forces, “all possible options are on the table” for a response.

Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted in a report Tuesday that Russia continued limited offensive operations in eastern Ukraine and had not switched to a broader offensive as it waited for reinforcements to arrive. As a result, it had “made limited gains while continuing to sustain significant losses.”
Fighting in the east had not yet begun in earnest, British military intelligence said in an assessment Tuesday, but combat would “intensify over the next two or three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there.”
In the meantime, it said attacks were being aimed at Ukrainian positions near the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It also reported fighting around the southern cities of Kherson and Mykolaiv.
Neighboring Belarus, Russia’s ally, has become a key transit point for redeployment of Russian forces away from northern areas in preparation for fighting in the east. Putin’s comments about the war came as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko accompanied him to a spaceport in Russia’s far east.
There, Putin likened the struggle against punishing Western economic sanctions imposed after the invasion to the Cold War-era Russian space program, whose early successes stunned the United States. In televised remarks carried by Interfax, the Russian leader declared that “there is no doubt that we will achieve our goals” in Ukraine.
Sounding themes he has previously used to justify the war, Putin blamed Western aggression, and said he had acted to ensure Russia’s security.
“Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” he said of Moscow’s military campaign, which has devastated Ukrainian towns and cities and left thousands of civilians dead or wounded.
In an ominous indicator of Putin’s determination to crush dissent at home, the Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was reported to have been detained by police in Moscow. Kara-Murza recovered from two separate life-threatening bouts of poisoning that he and his supporters have blamed on the Kremlin. Word of his detention came from another opposition figure, Ilya Yashin, writing on Twitter.
Ukraine also announced that it had detained a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician. Zelensky said on Telegram Tuesday that Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian lawyer, business oligarch and politician with ties to Russia, had been detained in a “special operation.” Zelensky’s post showed a photo of Medvedchuk sitting in a chair wearing handcuffs and military fatigues.
In his late Tuesday broadcast, Zelensky proposed swapping Medvedchuk for captured Ukrainian prisoners of war and warned that Ukrainian forces would capture more soldiers.
“We will establish the full truth about all these savages,” Zelensky said. “No matter how much time and effort it takes, we will find them all. Let Medvedchuk be an example for you.”
Meanwhile, major Western companies continued an exodus from Russia. On Tuesday, Finland-based telecom network Nokia said it was exiting the Russian market. A day earlier, the Swedish telecom giant Ericsson said it was suspending operations in Russia, and France’s third-largest bank, Societe Generale, said it was selling its controlling stake in Russia’s Rosbank.
Well before it invaded, Russia was clamping down on domestic freedoms and paving the way to mount a war in Ukraine with little home-grown opposition, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
The comments came during Tuesday’s release of the annual State Department human rights report, which examines all 193 countries that are members of the U.N. for abusive practices including extrajudicial killings; repression of journalists, minorities, and members of the political opposition; and treatment of prisoners.
Each report looks at the previous year, so Russia had not yet invaded Ukraine when this edition was completed. Yet discussion of the brutality of Russian actions in Ukraine now dominated release of the report, overseen by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
“Notably we seem to be seeing a crackdown by a regime that is more aggressive beyond its borders and more repressive within its borders,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price. Last year, hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested, a trend that has only snowballed this year, Price said.
Blinken cited as one positive development the successful U.S.-led move this month to kick Russia off the U.N.’s Human Rights Council.
“A country that’s perpetrating gross and systemic violations of human rights shouldn’t sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights,” Blinken said.

Across Kyiv, major road and bridge junctions were blocked with streetcars, buses and garbage trucks. Near the ring road that surrounds the city, trucks with rocket launchers parked in fields and released a fusillade toward Russian forces’ position to the northwest. And as Russian troops pressed on outside the city, residents of Kyiv’s suburbs were feeling the strain.
“We’ve seen more civilians. Sometimes soldiers too, but much more civilians,” said Volodymyr Andriiets, deputy director of the main hospital in Brovary, 15 miles northeast of Kyiv’s center. “Bullet wounds, shrapnel wounds; the ones we’ve seen are very severe, because many of them we see an appendage amputated.”

Andriiets looked weary. Though the area around the hospital seemed quiet, fighting was slowly approaching the suburb — a change reflected in patients admitted in the last three days.
While the clashes and efforts to evacuate more people continued, there were no breakthroughs for an end to the hostilities as Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met Thursday in Antalya, Turkey, for the two countries’ highest-level talks since the war began two weeks ago.
After negotiations lasting about an hour and a half, the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers emerged still far apart in their views of a conflict that has killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of people.
Although there was discussion of humanitarian issues, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there was no progress on Kyiv’s key demand of an immediate cease-fire.


World & Nation
Low morale, logistics problems and resilient Ukrainian soldiers are slowing advances by Russian forces toward Kyiv as the war goes into a third week.

“We can’t stop the war if the country that started the attack has no willingness to do that,” Kuleba said, adding that Moscow continued vainly to seek “a surrender from Ukraine.”
Kuleba noted that the encircled southern port city of Mariupol remained under constant shelling and bombing from Russian forces, in violation of repeated agreements to allow civilians safe passage out. Mariupol officials Thursday said three people, including a child, died when a maternity hospital was hit the day before, an assault whose brutality sparked outrage around the world. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a war crime.
In Warsaw, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday condemned Russia’s bombing of the hospital and said the attack should be investigated as a potential war crime.

“Absolutely there should be an investigation,” Harris said during a joint news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw. “Just limited to what we have seen: Pregnant women going for healthcare being injured by — I don’t know — a missile, a bomb in an unprovoked, unjustified war.”


The toll from the hospital added to the more than 1,200 people killed in Mariupol alone so far, according to the city’s deputy mayor — a number that far eclipses the figure issued for all of Ukraine by the United Nations, which acknowledges its tally to be an undercount.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov brushed aside criticism over his country’s deadly strike on the hospital, calling the accusation of an atrocity another of Ukraine’s “pathetic cries.” He alleged that the facility had become a base for radical Ukrainian fighters, that women and children had been moved out and that Ukraine was using civilians as human shields.

Sticking to Moscow’s narrative of the invasion that began Feb. 24, Lavrov insisted that Russia “did not attack Ukraine” but rather launched a “special military operation” — he refused to call it a war — because Ukraine presented “a direct threat” to his country.
“Ukraine is being made into an anti-Russian state” through Western manipulation and intimidation, Lavrov said. He reiterated Moscow’s demand for the “de-militarization” and “denazification” of a country whose army is a small fraction of the size of Russia’s and whose president is Jewish.
Although some observers had speculated that the foreign ministers’ meeting could pave the way for direct talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, such a summit seems a distant prospect.
Lavrov said the two leaders would meet only if it could achieve “added value” beyond ongoing negotiations at lower levels.

The Times’ Marcus Yam, no stranger to war photography, gives a first-person account from Ukraine.

Far from the diplomatic wrangling in Turkey, officials in some of Ukraine’s most war-battered cities struggled to evacuate their people to safety.
Ukrainian authorities said evacuation routes from seven cities had been agreed on Thursday with the Russian side, but it was unclear whether fighting had actually halted in those so-called humanitarian corridors. Only three of six routes Wednesday were able to operate, Zelensky said.
Heavily besieged Mariupol, whose plight has captured international attention, was once again on the evacuation list.
Late Thursday, Zelensky said Ukrainians delivered hundreds of tons of water, food and medicine along humanitarian corridors and evacuated about 40,000 people from the cities of Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and Izyum. But the towns of Mariupol and Volnovakha remained blocked because Russian troops refused to cease fire.
“We did everything necessary to make the humanitarian corridor work,” Zelensky said in a video posted on Facebook. “But the invaders started a tank attack exactly in the area where this corridor was supposed to be. ... They did it consciously. They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment.”
After stalling for many days, Russian troops moved about three miles closer to Kyiv, a senior U.S. Defense official said Thursday afternoon at a Pentagon briefing. They are now about 12 miles north of the city center, the official added, and the city of Chernihiv is isolated and seeing heavy fighting.
The U.S. continues to provide security assistance to Ukraine, with another shipment arriving in the next 24 hours.
Forty-two Republican senators signed a letter Thursday urging President Biden to work with Poland to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine, one day after the Department of Defense said such a move could be seen by Russia as an escalation.
Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will suspend normal trade relations with Russia, a person familiar with the plan confirmed Thursday evening.
The move, which will come in concert with the Group of 7 and European Union, will pave the way for the administration to increase tariffs on Russian imports above the levels pledged to all World Trade Organization members.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said his city had turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian invasion.
“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he said, adding that even people who never expected to do so “are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”
For Ukrainians on the outskirts of Kyiv, there were small victories: A skirmish ensued about 20 miles to the northeast on Thursday when a column of Russian armored vehicles tried to breach the city’s defenses near a bridge on the main highway between Kyiv and Chernihiv.


By midmorning, Ukrainian soldiers were showing off a Russian armored personnel carrier whose occupants had run away, a Ukrainian commander said. The vehicle sat on the side of the highway, its dull-green metal glinting in the cold morning sun.
But in Brovary, Andriiets, the hospital deputy director, said fear of bombardment was forcing workers to move patients to the basement two to three times a day.
He walked to the bed of Vasil Seychuk, a 40-year-old firefighter who had been in his house when a shell slammed into it Wednesday. Part of his right thumb was gone, and his right ankle lay swathed in a large, blood-stained bandage.
“You can fit an apple in the wound there,” said Oxana, his wife.

In the same room was Vitaly, a soldier who — like most of the military personnel interviewed — gave only his first name for reasons of safety. His nickname means “bulletproof,” a moniker he appeared to earn, walking around the room and talking with an energy not seen in others on the floor.
But then he revealed what was left of his arm: A piece of shrapnel had sliced it a little beyond the elbow, the result of a hail of artillery on his position in Hoholiv, a town 10 miles east of Brovary.
Andriiets looked at it morosely, looking for the words in English before he said, “Traumatic amputation.”
Vitaly laughed. “I became two kilos lighter,” he said.
In Kyiv’s northwestern suburbs, Ukrainian and Russian forces clashed in the streets and parks of Irpin.
On Thursday afternoon, a drive through revealed a mostly empty town; even the stream of refugees was largely gone. A few pensioners and volunteers delivering aid and running shelters were the soldiers’ only company.
One woman, Tamara Ashtonova, said hello to a volunteer. She had no plans to leave; a recent hip operation meant she could not walk long distances.
For now, the front line had moved back to Irpin’s northern edge, to the bridge connecting it to Bucha, the site of repeated confrontations.
It was now quiet, but that didn’t stop Vladimir Korotya, a commander from Bucha, from ducking low and running out to an excavator parked in the road.
“My wife and family reached Poland today,” he said, a big grin on his face. “Today I’m happy.”

Americans and other outsiders are helping Ukraine mount a crowdfunding war online.

In Mariupol, Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov said Thursday morning that Russian shelling had forced fleeing people to turn back — to dire living conditions he likened in an interview with the BBC to those of “ancient times,” without heat, water or sanitation.
In a city where two weeks ago residents gathered in cafes and moved around freely, people were collecting snow in subfreezing temperatures to melt for drinking water and scrounging for firewood to cook what food they had left.
Orlov said 1,207 people in Mariupol were killed in the first nine days of the war, some of whom were recently interred in a mass grave for lack of opportunity or resources to accord them more dignified burials. Because it has been hard to recover bodies, Orlov fears the real number of dead could be three times that figure.
Of the enemy’s ultimate goal, “now I think his final aim is to have Ukraine without Ukrainians,” Orlov said. “He’s not fighting with [the] Ukrainian army and Ukrainian troops; he’s fighting with civil society, with all Ukraine as a nation.”
The International Committee of the Red Cross warned that the humanitarian situation in Mariupol has become “increasingly dire and desperate.” In an interview posted on the organization’s website, Sasha Volkov, a Red Cross representative, said that all shops and pharmacies were looted four to five days ago and people were running out of food and medical supplies.
“Some people still have food, but I’m not sure for how long it will last,” Volkov said. “People started to attack each other for food. People started to ruin someone’s car to take the gasoline out.”

Ukraine says Russia has begun its long-expected all-out assault on the east —  and Moscow’s top diplomat confirmed Tuesday that the struggle has entered its next stage.  Western military officials and analysts warned that the current Russian attacks may  be  setting the battlefield for a larger and potentially far more brutal offensive planned by Moscow.

More than 4.6 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded, but millions more have stayed to help defend their country. These are their stories.

“We think that these offensives are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,” a Pentagon official said Tuesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Russia still has about 75% of the soldiers and weapons it assembled before the Ukraine invasion and is currently conducting “shaping operations” that will lay the groundwork for more significant strikes.
On a call with key allies Tuesday, President Biden discussed providing more ammunition and other security assistance to Ukraine and imposing new economic penalties against Russia, the White House said.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. is preparing another round of sanctions against Moscow that could be announced this week.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed for the first time that Europe is planning an embargo on Russian oil imports. “We are currently developing clever mechanisms so that oil can also be included in the next sanctions step,” she told Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview over  the weekend.
While the European Union has already banned the import of Russian coal, many of its member states have been wary of giving up hydrocarbons. EU countries rely on Russia for roughly a quarter of their oil and more than 40% of their natural gas and worry that an abrupt embargo could devastate their economies.
Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, implored civilians to get out of the eastern battle zone by any means possible, but acknowledged that for a third straight day there had been no agreement reached with Russia to set up humanitarian corridors for those fleeing the fighting.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called Tuesday for a four-day pause in fighting to allow civilians to escape.
Guterres proposed that the cease-fire span Thursday to Sunday, coinciding with the Easter Holy Week celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
“Save lives. Stop the bloodshed and destruction. Open a window for dialogue and peace,” he said in a public plea to Russian and Ukrainian officials.
Guterres said more than 12 million people in Ukraine were in need of humanitarian assistance, with one-third spread between the eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol.

In Mariupol, which has been largely flattened by Russian bombs that officials say have claimed some 20,000 lives,  several thousand Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of civilians have been holed up in a network of tunnels in  a sprawling steelworks plant.
Russia has repeatedly pushed the Ukrainian forces hunkered in the plant to surrender, promising that those who lay down their arms “are guaranteed to remain alive.” But as happened over the weekend, the latest surrender deadline came and went without any sign of  Ukrainian compliance.
A Ukrainian commander says Russia has been using “bunker-buster” bombs to try to dislodge the defenders.
Mariupol’s capture would likely be hailed by Russia as a pivotal triumph in a war that has yielded few of those for Moscow. It would free up more brigades for the eastern fight, as well as enable the creation of a strategically important land corridor between Russian-controlled areas and the annexed Crimean peninsula.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most important goal at this point in the war is to capture Mariupol, to be able to portray it as a major victory in whose glow he can cast the war effort on May 9, the Victory Day marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, a senior European official said Tuesday.
The official said satellite imagery shows that 90% of Mariupol has been destroyed, and given the many civilians who were not able to escape, the death toll is likely to be high.
“We do expect the complete destruction of the city and many civilian casualties,” the official said.
“My fear is that it is going to be worse than Bucha,” he said, referring to the Kyiv suburb that has become the focal point of some of Russia’s most vicious alleged attacks on civilians.
The official, who briefed a group of reporters  on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information, said Putin’s focus on the east is part of a strategy to build a land bridge from the Donbas region to the Crimean peninsula that he  annexed eight years ago. The plan also includes controlling the Kherson area, where fighting raged Tuesday,  to secure freshwater canals to Crimea. Then, he wants to seize additional territory to the west of the Donbas as a buffer zone.

Moscow was initially silent on Monday night when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that the war for Ukraine’s industrial east, known as the Donbas, had begun. The area is made up of two large regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of which are already controlled by Russia-backed separatists who have been battling Ukrainian forces for eight years.
“We will fight,” Zelensky vowed in a video address. “We will defend ourselves.”
Russia appeared to confirm the wider offensive’s start when Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that “another stage of this operation is beginning.”
“I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation,” Lavrov told Indian television. Russia refers to Europe’s biggest land war since World War II as a “special military operation.”




Ukraine’s military said Tuesday that Russia’s apparent aim was to seize full control of the Donbas. Its general staff said in a statement that overnight and early Tuesday, “the occupiers made an attempt to break through our defenses along nearly the entire front line,” a distance of more than 300 miles.
All along the battlefront, Russian forces were probing for “sensitive spots” in Ukraine’s defense, presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said. But speaking on national television, he predicted the offensive would fail because the Russians “simply do not have enough strength.”
Even so, civilian casualties were mounting. Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said on Ukrainian television that the town of Kreminna came under heavy artillery fire overnight, setting residential buildings ablaze.
In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, hammered by near-constant bombardment, five people had been killed by shelling in the last 24 hours, the regional governor said Tuesday.
South of there, in the contested city of Kramatorsk, a massive blast Tuesday afternoon sent people and dogs scurrying from the streets. Rescue crews said the explosion was caused by a Russian X-58 missile hitting a cement factory in the center of the city.
The missile had slammed through the factory’s roof, covering manufacturing equipment and other detritus in a fine gray dust. Beside the building were the remains of a large truck and the body of a factory worker covered by a yellow tarp, a gash on his face and a pool of blood at his side.
For many in the battle zone, there’s no clear distinction between a much-heralded new phase of fighting and what has already occurred during the nearly two months since Russia invaded its smaller neighbor.
In Avdiivka, less than two miles from the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, shelling had been a constant backdrop, with many forced to live their lives largely underground. In one school, some 200 people took shelter in the dank confines of a basement, sleeping on mattresses laid over desks. They shared one bathroom, on the ground level.
A month ago, an artillery round smashed the fourth-floor apartment of the head of Avdiivka’s utility company, who gave only his first name, Rostislav, for reasons of privacy.
His family — a wife and three children, the youngest seven months old — found safety in the Black Sea city of Odesa. But the shelling stole a home whose purchase had cost him all he had.
“I’m 37, and I have nothing,” he said.
Standing in front of the ruined apartment building, he pointed out where the shell had hit, debris now in an organized pile on the side of the street. Nearby were gouges and craters in the sidewalk where other artillery rounds had fallen.
Despite Avdiivka’s proximity to the front lines of the eight-year war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces, Rostislav described a community that flourished before the Feb. 24 invasion.
“There was work, money and happiness,” he said. Now, like so many other cities across the Donbas, it was virtually  empty.
Asked if he planned to leave, he sighed.
“Not today,” he said.

In a video address overnight, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the aerial attack a day earlier near the center of Kyiv after his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres was a sign of “Russia’s true attitude to global institutions” and would provoke “a strong response.”
“We still have to drive the occupiers out,” Zelensky said, citing recent bombings in Kyiv and Fastiv, southwest of the capital, as well as Odesa, a strategic port city on the Black Sea that has increasingly become a target of missiles, including one this week that struck a major bridge and railway link.
The shifting state of affairs in Ukraine — where Russia had telegraphed its intention to focus on the eastern Donbas region claimed by pro-Moscow separatists yet has continued to assault parts of the country’s west and center — prompted the U.S., Britain and other NATO members to add troops around Ukraine and pledge billions of additional dollars in humanitarian and military aid through the summer.


“We need to be prepared for the long term,” Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said late Thursday after President Biden announced that he would ask Congress to approve $33 billion in new aid to Kyiv. “There is absolutely the possibility that this war will drag on and last for months and years.”
The British government said Friday that it would dispatch 8,000 troops over the summer to Eastern Europe for extended exercises to deter Russian aggression. The deployment is among the largest by the nation since the Cold War and will include training with thousands of troops from NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force, an alliance that includes Finland and Sweden, non-NATO nations that this week were told their membership would be fast-tracked if they petitioned to join.

Politics
President Biden vows anew that the U.S. is committed to ensuring Ukraine’s ultimate victory against Russia in a war likely to drag on for months.



Britain also said Friday that it would send war crimes investigators to Ukraine after reports of rape by Russian troops, the discovery of mass graves outside Kyiv and reports of additional mass burials near the southern city of Mariupol.
“Russia has brought barbarity to Ukraine and committed vile atrocities, including against women. British expertise will help uncover the truth and hold Putin’s regime to account for its actions. Justice will be done,” said British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.
On Friday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Russian President Vladimir Putin had accepted an invitation to participate in the Group of 20 summit planned for fall in Bali. Indonesia is the current chair of the G-20.
“Indonesia wants to unite the G-20,” he said in a statement. “Don’t let there be a split. Peace and stability are the keys to the recovery and development of the world economy.”
In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby grew emotional while speaking to reporters Friday about the war, in which many Ukrainian civilians have been targeted and killed by Russian forces overseen by Putin.
“It’s difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that,” Kirby said. “I can’t talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity.”
As Kyiv cleaned up after missiles hit a commercial and residential neighborhood, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that a body had been recovered from the rubble. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S.-funded news organization, said its worker Vira Hyrych was killed.

A 22-year-old former U.S. Marine was also killed alongside Ukrainian forces, his relatives told news outlets, in the first known death of an American citizen fighting in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press.
Willy Joseph Cancel was killed Monday while working for a military contracting company that sent him to Ukraine, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, told CNN. Cancel had recently worked as a corrections officer in Tennessee and served in the Marines Corps from 2017 to 2021, joining the year he graduated from high school, the Associated Press reported.
Cabrera told news outlets her son had signed up to work with the private military contractor shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
“He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn’t come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn’t have to be involved in it,” she said.
Cancel had a 7-month-old son.
“They haven’t found his body. They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed,” Cabrera said. “We would love for him to come back to us.”
In Mariupol, where 600 people — military and civilians — were surrounded by Russians in a vast steel plant that is Ukraine’s last holdout in the once-thriving city, another attempt at an evacuation was announced Friday, authorities said. Several attempts to transport Ukrainians out of the Azovstal plant, including Russian offers to allow safe passage, have not materialized.
At a news conference, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said that “if Mariupol is hell, Azovstal is worse,” and those trapped were “begging to be saved.”

Boychenko said his city had been “destroyed” but denied that it had fallen to Russia. “Mariupol is holding,” he said.
Fighting continued to rage in the east, along a 300-mile battlefront in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where Ukrainians and Russians have traded increasingly heavy fire for weeks as locally organized humanitarian efforts are distributing basic supplies to fleeing populations.
In Sumy, near the Russian border, officials said there were multiple rounds of shelling Friday morning but did not report deaths or injuries.

The U.S. wants to seize the luxurious superyacht Amadea — worth some $325 million — because of its shadowy ties to Russia.

In Russia, authorities reported shelling in the border regions of Kursk and Bryansk and blamed fire from Ukraine. Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the shelling, but an advisor to Zelensky said this week that Ukraine reserved the right to hit “warehouses and bases of the killers in Russia” — an assertion that U.S. and British leaders have echoed.
West of the front lines, in Dnipro, Ukrainian fighter jets flew over farmlands Friday as workers planted zucchini and cabbage. Air-raid sirens went off regularly in the city, where buses and everyday life seemed to go on without great interruption.
Sirens also sounded overnight in Lviv, the western city near the Polish border that has become a major transit point for millions of refugees, though no explosions could be heard. In the morning, the streets were full of traffic, and people clustered at coffee kiosks.
The Lviv area, which has been mostly spared from violence but has seen a few deadly missile attacks since March, is now home to 335,000 internally displaced Ukrainians, Lviv Gov. Maksym Kozytsky said Friday on Telegram. Overall, more than 8 million Ukrainians have been displaced within the country’s borders, and over 5 million have fled abroad.

After staying behind as long as they dare, residents who decide to flee besieged Mariupol find that a long and nerve-racking ordeal awaits.

In his Telegram message, Kozytsky urged residents to stay calm. “Have a nice day everyone! Everything will be fine,” he said.
In Odesa, near the Moldova border, locals said their sense of safety had been punctured in recent days after attacks severed the Zatoka bridge, a vital road and railway connection. Officials said three missiles were shot down overnight in the area.
The attacks — along with fears of the war extending to Transnistria, a breakaway Russia-backed region sandwiched between Odesa and Moldova — left many people feeling tense, said Vladislav Davidzon, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council who is originally from Odesa and lives there intermittently.
Davidzon added that the local government had scheduled a full-day curfew for Monday, the anniversary of 2014 clashes between pro-Ukraine and pro-Russia activists. Commemorative rallies are held each year.
“The city authorities are trying their best to make sure the situation doesn’t explode,” he said.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-18/syrian-fighters-ready-to-join-next-phase-of-ukraine-war;2022-04-18;Syrian fighters ready to join next phase of Ukraine war - Los Angeles Times;"During a visit to Syria in 2017, Vladimir Putin lavished praise on a Syrian general whose division played an instrumental role in defeating insurgents in the country’s long-running civil war. The Russian president told him his cooperation with Russian troops “will lead to great successes in the future.”
Now members of Brig. Gen. Suheil Hassan’s division are among hundreds of Russian-trained Syrian fighters who have reportedly signed up to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, including Syrian soldiers, former rebels and experienced fighters who fought for years against the Islamic State group in Syria’s desert.
So far, only a small number appears to have arrived in Russia for military training ahead of deployment on the front lines. Although Kremlin officials boasted early in the war of more than 16,000 applications from the Middle East, U.S. officials and activists monitoring Syria say there have not yet been significant numbers of fighters from the region joining the war in Ukraine.
Analysts, however, say this could change as Russia prepares for the next phase of the battle with a full-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine. They believe fighters from Syria are more likely to be deployed in coming weeks, especially after Putin named Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, who commanded the Russian military in Syria, as the new war commander in Ukraine.
Though some question how effective Syrian fighters would be in Ukraine, they could be brought in if more forces are needed to besiege cities or to make up for rising casualties. Dvornikov is well acquainted with the multiple paramilitary forces in Syria trained by Russia while he oversaw the strategy of ruthlessly besieging and bombarding opposition-held cities in Syria into submission.
“Russia is preparing for a greater battle” in Ukraine and Syrian fighters are likely to take part, said Ahmad Hamada, a Syrian army defector who is now a military analyst based in Turkey.
Syria observers and activists say the Russians have been actively recruiting in Syria for the Ukraine war, particularly among Russian-trained combatants.
Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported that so far about 40,000 people have registered — 22,000 with the Russian military and about 18,000 with the Russian private contractor Wagner Group.

Around 700 members of Hassan’s 25th Special Missions Forces Division, known in Syria as the Tiger Force, left Syria over the past weeks to fight along Russian forces, Abdurrahman said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed.
Pro-government activists posted videos over the last two weeks on social media showing members of the Tiger Force performing military drills including parachuting from helicopters. Russian officers appeared in one of the videos advising the paratroopers inside a helicopter as Hassan praised the young men by tapping on their heads. It was not immediately clear if the videos were new.
Abdurrahman said there are also volunteers from the Russian-trained 5th Division; the Baath brigades, which is the armed wing of Assad’s ruling Baath party; and the Palestinian Quds Brigade, made up of Palestinian refugees in Syria. All have fought alongside the Russian military in Syria’s war.
“The Russians are looking for experienced fighters. They don’t want anyone who was not trained by the Russians,” Abdurrahman said.
The Tiger Force took credit for some of the biggest government victories in the 11-year conflict. It was involved in a months-long Russian-backed campaign into the rebels’ last enclave, in the northwest province of Idlib, which ended in March 2020 with government forces capturing a vital north-south highway — though rebels remain in control of the enclave.
Hassan “is one of Russia’s men and Russia will depend on him,” said Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who runs the DeirEzzor 24, a Syria war monitoring group.
Hundreds of fighters from the 5th Division and the Quds Brigade have registered at Russia’s Hmeimeem base in western Syria, which is leading recruitment efforts, and are waiting for orders, he said.
In late March, a Russian-trained force known as the ISIS Hunters militia, which fought for years against Islamic State, posted an ad calling on men aged 23 to 49 to come forward for screening, saying those who pass the test and are found suitable will be called on later.
So far, about 100 men have registered their names in the southern province of Sweida, according to Rayan Maarouf of Suwayda24, an activist collective that covers Islamic State activities in the Syrian desert. He added that they were promised a monthly income of no less than $600, a huge sum of money amid widespread unemployment and the crash of the Syrian pound.
Earlier this month, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. had indications that the Wagner Group is trying to recruit fighters, mostly from the Middle East, to deploy in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
But he said there has been “no specific information” on numbers recruited. “We just aren’t there yet to see anything real demonstrable when it comes to reinforcement,” he added.
Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in early March that so far there are only “very small groups” trying to make their way from Syria to Ukraine, calling it a “very small trickle.”
Retired Lebanese army general Naji Malaeb, who follows the war in Syria closely, said there is no indication so far of Syrian fighters traveling to Russia, but this could change as the war drags on.
“This all depends on what the Russians plan to do in the near future,” Malaeb said.
Syrian and Palestinian officials in Syria have played down reports of fighters heading to Ukraine. The Syrian government is likely wary of having Syrian fighters flock to Ukraine, opening opportunities at the front lines that its many opponents could exploit.
In a potentially worrying sign for the Syrian government, Russia has significantly scaled down its operations in Syria since the war in Ukraine started, with fewer airstrikes targeting Islamic State or opposition positions in Idlib.
“Any change in the posture of Russian forces or pro-regime militias creates security gaps that anti-regime actors including Turkey, ISIS, al-Qaida and Syrian opposition groups can exploit,” the ISW report said.
Muhannad Haj Ali, a former legislator and a commander with the armed wing of Syria’s ruling Baath party said no Syrians have gone to fight in Ukraine and that he didn’t expect any to go.
He said he was certain Russia will win in Ukraine without any need for Syrians’ help.
“The way the operations are going is clear indication that Ukraine will not be another Afghanistan,” he said."

In Bucha, shocked into silence by atrocities that left bodies in the streets, about two dozen of the faithful gathered for a service while the exhumation of bodies continued from a mass grave in the church’s yard.
In Makariv, a handful of members visited a badly damaged riverside church, at times moved to tears. Small golden crosses for rosaries lay scattered on the floor with the shattered glass.

And in Borodyanka, where Russian attacks ripped a blackened hole in a high-rise apartment building, volunteers and donations filled an almost untouched church a short walk away, while residents lined up at the door for food and other assistance. Many were elderly people who stayed behind while others fled.
On the day when Pope Francis called for an Easter truce in Ukraine to make way for a negotiated peace, church visitors invoked God in recalling their survival.
“Each person who was leaving, from any place — Makariv, Bucha, Hostomel — or from Andriivka, the neighboring village which was destroyed to the ground; each one, even those who did not know the Lord’s Prayer, he was speaking to God with his own words,” said Alona Parkhomenko in Makariv, where the church exterior was speckled with bullet holes and the priest warned of falling glass.
The Russian retreat from the region surrounding Kyiv has enabled some of the millions of Ukrainians who fled over the border or to other parts of the country to return home. Some are finding their places of worship damaged or destroyed. Ukrainian authorities in late March said at least 59 spiritual sites including churches, mosques and synagogues had been hit.
In Makariv, the priest, Bogdan Lisechenko, said the church beside the river is in critical condition with spring rains looming. “Now we are taking out the icons, saving them because the water is coming,” he said. “For now, we will close the windows to prevent looting.”
For Easter, which this year the Orthodox world observes on April 24, the priest said the blessing would be given in a church in another village that so far has escaped damage in the war."

In Dnipro, hundreds of worshipers arrived at the end of curfew at dawn to celebrate Orthodox Christian Easter at Troitska Church illuminated with hundreds of candles inside. They circled the church carrying Easter baskets, filled with Easter cakes, fruit, and other goodies, along with a lighted candle.

Anatolii Oliinyk returned to his humble home in Bucha three days ago. He found his father facedown on the floor of his bedroom. Russian forces had broken the door open and killed him, leaving his barefoot body beside the bed where he slept. On the wall hung photographs of his children and his own portrait as a young man. Anatoly, age 38, a mechanic, evacuated with his wife and three children, but his father was too old to travel and didn’t want to go.

A simple, wooden cross marks the grave where Anatolii buried his father, also named Anatolii Oliinyk, 90, in the garden behind the house. He said he will take his father to the morgue to have his execution documented by investigators before giving him a proper burial next week.


Three members of the Ostrovskii family — Viktorya, 51; Anatoli, 75; and Vyacheslav, 32 — were buried together in a single grave at the Bucah cemetery Friday. The three were shot and killed by Russians on March 7, as they tried to flee Bucha in their car. A family friend was the only person there to see the bodies laid to rest.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-04-28/bad-roads-review-ukraine-oscar-submission;2022-04-28;'Bad Roads' review: A grim dispatch from Russian-occupied Donbas region - Los Angeles Times;"The four tales told in “Bad Roads,” Natalya Vorozhbit’s bleak and unnerving first feature, add up to a startlingly grim panorama of life during wartime. We are in the battle-scarred Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, sometime after the spring of 2014, when tensions between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists flared into armed conflict but long before the terrible escalations of the last few months. Like Sergei Loznitsa’s recently rereleased “Donbass,” though less sprawling in scope and more intimate in feel, this omnibus work functions as both a lament and a prophecy. With each story, Vorozhbit pulls us a little deeper into the heart of contested, occupied territory, where soldiers and civilians dwell in unbearable tension, women are grievously exploited and, as the title suggests, wrong turns and ill-advised journeys abound.
The first unlucky traveler we meet is a middle-aged school principal (Igor Koltovskyy) driving through a security checkpoint. It’s a routine trek that quickly goes south when he can’t find his passport; his mild inebriation doesn’t help his case. As he pleads with two armed soldiers (Andrey Lelyukh and Vladimir Gurin), you fear, not for the last time in this movie, that impatience will tilt into aggression and violence. But Vorozhbit has a gift for building tension through narrative restraint and mordant humor; she also has a keen sense of misdirection. What gives the story its moral sting is the moment the principal recognizes — or thinks he recognizes — a young woman in a soldier’s nearby bunker, the latest living casualty of a war without end.
For the record:
2:20 p.m. April 29, 2022An earlier version of this review misspelled director Natalya Vorozhbit’s last name as Volorozhbit.
Does the principal really see what he thinks he sees? “Bad Roads,” which was Ukraine’s 2021 Oscar submission for international feature, suggests the question is irrelevant: Whatever’s happening in this particular instance, it speaks to the long-term trauma of an ongoing military presence and the malevolence that can seep, without warning, into everyday encounters. This first story, which takes place under a hot sun and centers on three men, is both a prologue and a bit of an anomaly: It establishes a theme — the plight of women in wartime — that will be given more unflinching attention in the remaining three vignettes, each of which focuses on a woman’s experience and unfolds under cover of darkness.
Those stories are all self-enclosed, with conversant themes and beats but no overlapping characters. It’s a structural choice that underscores each character’s sense of isolation, but it also highlights the weird, sometimes terrible intimacy that can take root between strangers. The second story focuses on a trio of teenage girls waiting at a bus stop for their boyfriends, who turn out to be enemy soldiers. We never meet those men but their presence is felt in scraps of gossip that reveal the desperate, transactional nature of relationships in a place where everything — a cigarette, a bag of seeds, a woman’s body — has a price. As nighttime shadows descend, the camera lingers on one of the girls (Anna Zhurakovskaya) as she has a lonely nighttime meeting with her grandmother (Yuliya Matrosova), who begs her to come home with her, invoking memories of happier, less fraught times.
The understated, open-air melancholy of the second story devolves into horrific, claustrophobic violence in the third, which follows a female journalist (Maryna Klimova) as she’s imprisoned and verbally and physically abused by a soldier (Yuri Kulinich) in an underground bunker. The actors’ commitment to this brutal spectacle is remarkable, especially Klimova’s as her character tries, with as much sober determination as she can muster, to appeal to her captor’s long-abandoned sense of decency. But Vorozhbit’s technical virtuosity — the starkness of the production design, the intricate pools of light and shadow at play in her carefully composed frames and the soundtrack’s relentless “Stalker”-esque drip-drip of water — serves only to emphasize the artificiality of this longest and most punishing episode. (It runs about 40 minutes and seems to go on for hours, which is surely by design.)
The two middle stories in particular are marked by a certain staginess, a sense of visual abstraction, that points to the movie’s origins in Vorozhbit’s 2017 play, also titled “Bad Roads.” More convincingly inhabited is the film’s fourth and finest segment, in which a young woman (Zoya Baranovskaya) accidentally runs over a chicken with her car and tries to compensate its owners, a poor older couple (Oksana Voronina and Sergei Solovyov). What begins as an admirable, if naive, act of atonement gradually spirals, in quietly terrifying and mordantly funny fashion, into a waking nightmare as a lifetime of class resentment and economic woe comes writhing to the surface. Impressively restrained in its flirtation with full-bore horror, it’s a reminder that when inhumanity is the everyday norm, there may be few things more futile — or dangerous — than the stirrings of individual conscience.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-17/pope-makes-easter-plea-for-ukraine-peace-cites-nuclear-risk;2022-04-17;Pope makes Easter plea for Ukraine peace, cites nuclear risk - Los Angeles Times;"On what is supposed to be Christianity’s most joyful day, Pope Francis made an anguished Easter Sunday plea for peace in the “senseless” war in Ukraine and in other armed conflicts raging around the world, and voiced worry about the risk of nuclear warfare.
“May there be peace for war-torn Ukraine, so sorely tried by the violence and destruction of this cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged,” Francis said, speaking from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Square.
The pontiff had just finished celebrating Easter Mass in the square packed by the faithful for the holiday for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020. Applause erupted from many in the crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number 100,000 in the square and on a nearby avenue, when he mentioned Ukraine.
“Please, please, let us not get used to war,’' Francis pleaded, after denouncing ”the flexing of muscles while people are suffering.” Yet again, the pontiff didn’t cite Russian President Vladimir Putin for the decision to launch the invasion and attacks against Ukraine on Feb. 24.
People’s hearts are filled with “fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing,” the pontiff said.
“Let us all commit ourselves to imploring peace, from our balconies and in our streets,’' Francis said. ”May the leaders of nations hear people’s plea for peace.”
In a clear reference to the threat of nuclear warfare, Francis quoted from a noted declaration of 1955: “‘Shall we put an end to the human race, or shall mankind renounce war?’”
He was quoting from a manifesto written by philosopher Bertrand Russell and physicist Albert Einstein. The manifesto’s text, sounding a grim warning against the consequences of nuclear warfare, was issued a few months after Einstein died.

Meanwhile, in Britain, the leader of the Anglican church, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, called for Russia to declare a cease-fire and withdraw from Ukraine.
Noting that in the Eastern Orthodox church, followed by many in Russia and Ukraine, Sunday marks the start of Holy Week — with Easter coming on April 24 — Welby exhorted Russia to withdraw from Ukraine and commit to talks.
Francis also drew attention to other wars in the speech known by its Latin name, “Urbi et Orbi” — to the city and to the world.
“May the conflict in Europe also make us more concerned about other situations of conflict, suffering and sorrow, situations that affect all too many areas of our world, situations that we cannot overlook and do not want to forget,’' Francis said.
Two days after Palestinians and Israeli police clashed in Jerusalem, Francis prayed that “Israelis, Palestinians and all the inhabitants of the Holy City, together with pilgrims, experience the beauty of peace, of living in brotherhood and of accessing Holy Places” in reciprocal respect.
He called for peace and reconciliation for the peoples of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Libya.
Francis spoke plaintively about Yemen, “which suffers from a conflict forgotten by all, with continuous victims.” He expressed hope that a recent truce would restore hope to that country’s people.
He also prayed that God grant “reconciliation for Myanmar, where a dramatic scenario of hatred and violence persists,” and for Afghanistan, which is gripped by a humanitarian crisis, including food shortages.
Francis denounced the exploitation of the African continent and “terrorist attacks — particularly in the Sahel region,” as well as the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia and violence in Congo.
In Latin America, many have seen their plight worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, aggravating social problems stemming from corruption, violence and drug trafficking, the pontiff said.
But Francis found hope in the “open doors of all those families and communities that are welcoming migrants and refugees throughout Europe,’' referring to the roughly 10 million people who have either fled Ukraine or are internally displaced by the war.
At the Polish border station of Medyka, a paramedic from Warsaw helped set out a traditional Easter breakfast with ham, cheese and Easter cakes for some of the latest refugees from Ukraine, the majority of whom have streamed into neighboring Poland.
“They lost their homes. They are seeking refuge in our country,” said volunteer Agnieszka Kuszaj. She hoped that the meal would help them “forget for a moment about all the terrible things” that have happened.
Maria Dontsova, 31, who is from Kharviv, the heavily bombed city in eastern Ukraine said: “I wish all families peace who are suffering in Ukraine at this great holiday Easter.” Speaking in English, she expressed hope that war will end “as soon as possible, and people stop suffering, and we can prevent the war [from] spreading to Europe”
Earlier, the pontiff, who has a knee ligament problem, limped badly as he made his way to an altar set up in front of St. Peter’s Basilica. After Easter morning Mass, Francis boarded the white popemobile for a whirl through the square among the cheering ranks of the crowd.
In Spain, believers and secular enthusiasts flocked back in large numbers to Holy Week processions this week for the first time since the start of the pandemic after most health restrictions were lifted.

Go count them': Russia batters Ukraine's east - Los Angeles Times;"The rows of graves were marked with simple crosses of fresh-cut wood. Black plaques with gold lettering declared the names. The occasional wreath broke the monotony of dull earthen colors, and, in the front, three rectangular holes awaited the newly fallen.
“How many graves? I don’t know. Go count them,” said the caretaker of this cemetery on Severodonetsk’s southern edge, which started to grow when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. “We’re digging new ones almost every day now.”
In the escalating fight over eastern Ukraine, Russia’s army — after consolidating and redeploying its forces from other parts of the country, including the capital, Kyiv — has renewed its thrust to seize the Donbas region. Fresh destruction is wreaked daily on communities battered both by nearly eight years of war against Moscow-backed separatists as well as this latest onslaught the Russians call a “special military operation.”
Russia’s strategy is to encircle the east and close in on Ukrainian forces. That has placed Severodonetsk, the easternmost tip of Ukrainian government control in the Donbas, as well as the city of Slavyansk, some 40 miles to the west on the strategic M03 highway, at the top of Moscow’s target list.
The main fear for residents here is that Russia will attempt to shell this region into submission as it is doing in the southern port city of Mariupol. With the growing certainty that the vise is closing — Russian troops on Friday fought Ukrainian soldiers for control of a town just over a mile northwest of Severodonetsk — many have already escaped. Only a fifth of Severodonetsk’s 106,000 people and possibly a quarter of Slavyansk’s 111,000-strong population have stayed put, authorities say.
Those who remain endure a surreal existence under increasingly lethal skies.
The few who brave the streets of Severodonetsk keep one eye on the ground as  they pick their way past artillery-ravaged buildings, mangled cars and low-hanging power lines. Sounds of destruction echo around them. Some ride a bicycle or walk their dog near the large square in front of the city council, past a crater with the remains of a rocket still inside. Wary soldiers, stationed with their rifles at the corner behind stacked sandbags, watch them go, fingers on trigger guards.
War makes suspicion even of neighbors. After more than fifty days of fighting, some, like Vladimir Kadavy, 49, a thin, shabbily-dressed man who worked as a caretaker maintaining Severodonetsk’s public spaces, seemed inured to the erratic drumbeat of missiles and shells playing above.
“I don’t have a basement or anywhere to shelter. I’m not afraid anymore. I hear this every day,” said Kadavy, his tired eyes unflinching as a thunderclap of artillery sounded.
He looked around the square, his voice tinged with sadness. The places he had spent much of his life keeping beautiful now lay in ruin. His boss told him that he would be evacuated in three days, but Kadavy, like many others interviewed, thought he would be at a loss if he left his hometown.
“If we go, who cares about us?” he said. “I was born here. Somehow I will survive here, I think.”
Though they did not display the same equanimity, Yura Alforov and his wife, Olga, didn’t want to leave either.
“We’re not calm about this. We just want peace,” Olga said.
The couple were on the way to the hospital, which was even closer to the front line. Yura, an electric maintenance engineer who had moved to Severodonetsk in 1984, had sprained his ankle while rushing to the basement during a shelling.
“We don’t have money to go, and have no place to go to anyway. How would we live if we left?” Alforov said. He took off his glasses and wiped away a tear.
The choice to stay is hard, but the decision to leave one’s home carries its own uncertainty.
Miles to the west, on a grimy corner near the Slavyansk train station, where a trio of stray dogs growled at each other over a scrap of food, Yuri Kovalenko, a 58-year-old coal miner, waited for the bus that would take him and his family to safety.
Two hours before, he had left his wife back at their farm in the mining town of Gorskaya, bringing with him his daughter Yulia and his two grandchildren, Dmitri, 7, and 5-year-old Igor. They were going to his sister’s place near Chernihiv.
“If we all came, it would be different,” he said, his blue eyes staring steadily ahead. “But my wife is staying to take care of the animals. I worry about her. So many years we lived together, had our life together, and now it’s time to go. How do I feel? I wish I never felt this.”
His gaze faltered; he walked away, his eyes reddening for a moment before he looked at his grandchildren playing off to the side and pulled himself together.
A shell falling near their town a day earlier had spurred the family’s escape. But it was also about the threat of living under Russian-backed separatist rule and the economic evisceration that was sure to follow.
“If Russians come here,” he said, “it will become a dangerous place.”
Their leaving wasn’t a moment too soon: That morning, train service was suspended from Slavyansk after an attack on the railway somewhere to the north and the Russian advance on the city of Barvinkove, 25 miles to the east. Many were also too afraid to go by train after last week’s horrific attack on the station in the nearby city of Kramatorsk.
Scenes of departures have become intimate portraits of loss and fear twined into the shared burden of survival.
Near the Slavyansk City Council building, a crowd of 71 people lugged suitcases, overstuffed backpacks and bags toward seven vans that would take them to the western Ukrainian city of Ternopyl. Among them was Dina Zhivilyak, 18. She helped an elderly woman, Lyudmilla Botkovskaya, carry her dog Kashtanka (so named after the dog in the eponymous short story by Anton  Chekhov; it means “little chestnut”) to one of the vans before wrestling with her own suitcase.
“I have the essentials here. Clothes I need for the trip, comfortable shoes, documents. And this,” Zhivilyak said, rummaging through her bags before coming up with a ragged-looking teddy bear: a gift from her foster parents when they first brought her from the orphanage.
With most shops shuttered and only a few major grocery stores operating, municipal authorities had taken to dispatching trucks to various parts of the city to distribute aid. One of them parked near Slavyansk’s central square. People queued to receive a bag full of onions and carrots.
“It’s very hard to get products. Everything is closed. So I’m standing here. I don’t even know what they’re giving out,” said Tanya, a 62-year-old pensioner who gave only her first name for reasons of privacy.
She was staying behind because of her three cats, she said, but had little fear anything would happen.
“I’m an optimist,” she said.
Just as fervent in her belief was Lydia Mychislavena,  a caretaker in the city’s Alexander Nevsky church. She lit the candles for the second daily  service. A few parishioners came, kneeling and bowing their heads as a priest and two women sang, their voices resonating across the church’s ornate interior.
“In the 2014 war, we stayed. We won’t go now,” said Mychislavena. She recounted how she was getting out of the shower and heard a voice in her head telling her to move to the other room. She did so, and saw shells coming; she prayed, and they flew over her head.
“Our prayer is stronger a million times than the bombs.”

Perhaps not a million, but many bombs have fallen between Slavyansk and Severodonetsk. They have taken lives, roads, shops and animals; they have ripped across fields and leveled buildings. Sergei Zaharolka, the 51-year-old deputy director of the Severodonetsk School, was bunkered with his wife, Lila, and several others at the school.
“The director went away, but I stayed. Where would we go? We want to watch over the school,” said Zaharolka.
They had converted much of the space underground into living quarters, including the school clinic and areas near the indoor swimming pool. Some staff members were assigned to cook food (bean stew, chicken and freshly baked bread). Others would clean or rig solutions to get amenities.
Zaharolka, a handsome man who resembled David Lynch — he believed he looked more like the dancer  Mikhail Baryshnikov — did woodwork. The atmosphere seemed less siege than strange camping trip, with two kids playing hide-and-seek in one of the hallways before straying into a boiler room crowded with mattresses, religious icons and belongings.
But all that did little to improve the mood of Natalya, the 44-year-old cleaning lady, who was there with her 9-year-old daughter Alona. She had stayed at the school almost from the beginning of the invasion on Feb. 24. She too had no intention to go, but was terrified of the bedlam happening nearby.
“Only fear. I feel nothing else. Just fear,” she said. She added that Alona understood there was war and wasn’t asking too many questions. Still, when the bombing became too much, “we just sit here and pray.”
Zaharolka walked up the stairs to the school’s outer yard. To the side lay a stack of crosses. Locals had asked him to make them, along with coffins. It was another way he could help, he said, and they would soon be going to the cemetery — a prospect he met with a shrug.
“I’m a carpenter. Some live. Some die. This is life.”
Moments later, an artillery shell landed to the north, striking something that released a dark, angry-looking plume of smoke that rose for miles, darkening the skies above the city."

Russian forces, meanwhile, rained shells on eastern Ukraine as they pressed ahead with their devastating 2-month-old invasion.
Addressing the first such supply disruption since the war’s start, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov strongly hinted that other European economies may be next. He told reporters Wednesday that if some customers “decline to pay under the new system” Russia has instituted — meaning in rubles instead of dollars or euros — they “of course” could face the same treatment.
Along a 300-mile battlefront in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Russian forces managed to capture a small town, Zarichne, the Ukrainian military said in an early morning operational report. The giant Azovstal steelworks in the battered southern port city of Mariupol, which has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, also came under new bombardment, the military said.
Russia has been trying since the start of the war to capture Mariupol, and the city’s last-ditch defenders and some civilians are holed up inside the sprawling Soviet-era steel complex laced with tunnels and bunkers. Even though fighting continues, Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed victory in the siege of the city, which Ukraine has not acknowledged.

The northeastern city of Kharkiv, partially hemmed in by Russian troops and under heavy bombardment since the start of the war, was rocked by loud explosions shortly after midnight. Later, the regional governor said on the messaging app Telegram that overnight strikes in outlying towns had killed three people and wounded 15 others.
Heavy pounding in advance of major ground movement, sometimes including strikes on civilian areas, is key to the Russian strategy in the east, British military intelligence said in an assessment Wednesday.

World & Nation
After staying behind as long as they dare, residents who decide to flee besieged Mariupol find that a long and nerve-racking ordeal awaits.

Amid fears of a widening war, officials in a pro-Russia breakaway region of Moldova — Ukraine’s small, impoverished western neighbor — accused Ukraine on Wednesday of attacking it. Russia last week telegraphed its aim of seizing Ukraine’s southern seacoast to link up with that breakaway region, Transnistria, as well as with the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.
In an overnight address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of attempting to cause a “global price crisis” and sow chaos in the food market.
“Ukrainian exports will help stabilize markets,” he said, “so it is beneficial not only for us, but also for all Europeans.”
The war has disrupted commodity markets and altered global patterns of trade and production in ways that will keep prices at historically high levels through the end of 2024, according to a World Bank report released this week.
Energy prices worldwide are projected to increase more than 50% in 2022 before easing in 2023 and 2024, the report said. Non-energy prices are expected to rise nearly 20% this year.
Russia is the world’s second-largest gas producer, behind the U.S. It is among the top three nations in oil production, alongside the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, supplying about 10% of what’s consumed worldwide.
Russia is also a major producer of wheat, palladium and nickel, while Ukraine is a large exporter of corn and wheat, and a key route for the flow of Russian natural gas to Europe. Wheat prices are forecast to increase by more than 40% this year, the report found.
“This amounts to the largest commodity shock we’ve experienced since the 1970s. As was the case then, the shock is being aggravated by a surge in restrictions in trade of food, fuel and fertilizers,” Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s vice president for equitable growth, finance and institutions, said in a statement.
Wednesday’s announcement by Russia’s state-run fuel company, Gazprom, of the cutoff of Poland and Bulgaria came a day after Western allies, at U.S. urging, vowed to redouble shipments of weaponry to help Ukraine fight off Russian forces for what could prove to be a protracted confrontation.

The war between Ukraine and Russia, which supply 75% of the world’s sunflower oil, has caused already-rising cooking oil prices to spiral upward.

Germany, in a policy shift, said it would ship armored antiaircraft systems to Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, speaking at Tuesday’s gathering of NATO and other allies at a U.S. air base in western Germany, called on those who want to help Ukraine to “move at the speed of war” to rush in more heavy armaments.
As Russia readies more troops and armor for its expanded offensive in eastern Ukraine, its Defense Ministry in Moscow said 59 Ukrainian military targets were destroyed overnight in airstrikes. It said targets included hangars containing foreign-supplied weapons and ammunition, but did not provide specifics. The claims could not be independently verified.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that dozens of the U.S. howitzers promised last week by the Biden administration are now in Ukraine.
U.S. training of Ukrainian personnel to use the howitzers is also underway in neighboring countries, Kirby said.
“It’s an active, kinetic fight there in the Donbas,” he said.
The suspension of gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria came after both countries, along with most other European Union nations, rejected Moscow’s demand that energy shipments be paid for in rubles, which would help prop up the Russian currency. Existing contracts almost uniformly specify dollar payments.
The EU promised Wednesday that it would forge a unified response to the cutoff, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called a Russian attempt to “blackmail” Europe.
“This is unjustified and unacceptable,” Von der Leyen said in a statement. “And it shows once again the unreliability of Russia as a gas supplier.”
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also scoffed at Moscow’s move. He told lawmakers that Russian-supplied energy was expected to be replaced by a combination of local production and gas transported from Norway.
Poland has drawn particular Russian ire because it has not only supplied Ukraine with weapons, but also has been a key conduit for arms from other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. The Polish government said it was prepared for the Russian step, which the onset of spring and warmer temperatures makes less alarming than if it had occurred just a few weeks ago.

The claim of Ukrainian aggression in Transnistria, also known as Trans-Dniester, came from the Interior Ministry of the separatist region, which said Ukraine launched drones and fired shots aimed at its territory. Local officials said this week that two radio towers were damaged in strikes, with explosions also reported in the pro-Moscow enclave’s capital, Tiraspol.
The Ukrainian government in Kyiv has denied any hostile actions directed at Transnistria, where a Russian garrison is stationed.
In Mariupol, prospects of alleviating the dire humanitarian situation for civilians — tens of thousands of whom remained trapped in the city, in addition to the few thousand sheltering at the steel plant — continued to remain distant.
Ukrainian officials said no agreements had been reached for setting up a humanitarian corridor Wednesday to try to get civilians out. A trickle of people has managed to flee the city, but Ukraine says Russia has repeatedly reneged on promises of safe passage for noncombatants.
Municipal authorities have estimated that the siege has left about 20,000 dead in bombardment and from starvation, and satellite imagery testifies to the presence of several mass graves on Mariupol’s outskirts.
Ukraine said there were no prospects for face-to-face talks between Zelensky and Putin, something Kyiv has repeatedly sought.
“The time of a meeting of the two countries’ presidents and the context of the meeting have not yet been determined,” said Ukraine’s lead negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak.
A senior Biden administration official told reporters Wednesday that a prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia did not represent a change in the U.S. government’s stance on the war in Ukraine. The exchange involved a U.S. Marine veteran held by Russia and a convicted Russian drug trafficker imprisoned in the United States.

The funding request — which earmarks $20 billion for military assistance, $8.5 billion in economic assistance to help Ukraine’s government continue to function and $3 billion in humanitarian aid — is what the U.S. believes will be necessary over the next five months as the war becomes a protracted conflict.
“We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,” Biden said during a speech from the White House. “The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is more costly.”

Biden also wants lawmakers to make it a crime for a person to “knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government,” double the statute of limitations for foreign money laundering offenses to 10 years, and expand the definition of racketeering under U.S. law to include efforts to evade sanctions.
“These are bad guys,” Biden said.
The president  asked Congress to allow the federal government to use the proceeds from selling the seized assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs to help the people of Ukraine. That proposal was already gaining bipartisan support in Congress, with Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and  Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) introducing legislation last month that would allow the Justice Department to liquidate confiscated assets and direct the funding  toward a new State Department relief fund for Ukraine.
The U.S. has already spent $14 billion to bolster Ukraine.
The latest White House push to broaden its support for Ukraine follows Biden’s announcement earlier this month of $1.6 billion in new defense aid, a tranche that included offensive weapons — howitzers, drones and helicopters — that Ukraine’s military desperately needs as the conflict shifts to a brutal ground battle in the country’s eastern Donbas region. And it comes just days after Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III traveled to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

After a top-flight U.S. delegation visits Kyiv, the U.S. says it will reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital

The increasing willingness of the U.S. and other NATO allies to heavily arm Ukraine marks a clear strategic shift away from the war’s initial phase, when allies had been more hesitant to send weapons and munitions that Russian President Vladimir Putin might view as an escalation.
In recent days, Moscow has reiterated threats that it may resort to more direct attacks against the West if it continues its support of Ukraine but those threats have not deterred the U.S. and other allies.
Biden, however, scoffed at claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Western support for Ukraine amounted to aggression against Moscow.
“We’re not attacking Russia. We’re helping Ukraine defend itself,” Biden said. “Russia is the aggressor. No if, ands or buts about it.”
He said Putin’s recent bluster was, in his view, “a reflection of [Russia’s] failure” on the battlefield.

But political scientists, military experts and opposition political leaders said the decision does not change Germany’s fundamental resistance to playing a leading role in trying to end the war.
They said that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had little choice but to bend to pressure from international allies and domestic political forces and that the 50 armored vehicles his government promised are a meager contribution compared with military aid flowing into Ukraine from the United States and other NATO members.
“Scholz and his political party still believe in the old Cold War slogan ‘Waffen bringen kein Frieden’ (“Weapons don’t bring peace”), so sending weapons to Ukraine has been anathema for them and still is,” said Thomas Jaeger, a political scientist at Cologne University.
In a country that has harbored deeply pacifist beliefs since the end of World War II, pollsters say a majority of Germans agree with the chancellor. A survey for RTL television on Tuesday found that only 26% believe the government should take a tougher stance against Russia.
“I think it’s a mistake for us to send weapons to Ukraine,” said Thomas Krueger, a 55-year-old manager of a small construction company in the city of Jueterbog. “I wouldn’t do anything to provoke [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in light of  all the nuclear warheads they have. Getting into a war with Russia is dangerous for the whole world.”
World & Nation
Many migrants from the former Soviet Union living in Germany support Vladimir Putin.

He blamed the United States for the war by encouraging the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to Russia’s doorstep — a belief that is widespread in the formerly communist eastern German states.

Germany and Russia have a long history of wars, revolutions and misunderstandings, but recent generations of German leaders, especially on the political left, have argued that peace and prosperity in Europe is possible only with a stable German-Russian alliance. They worked to deepen economic ties with Russia and raised German dependency on Russian energy to unprecedented levels.
In the buildup to the war, with 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s borders, Germany said it could not provide any lethal weapons but would gladly send steel helmets. The offer was roundly mocked, prompting the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to ask whether Germany would send pillows next.
Since the invasion, the most prosperous country in Europe has been reluctant to use any of its economic and military muscle to try to end the war.

New attacks hit Ukraine’s east and its capital as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres visits, declaring, “The war is evil.”

Though Scholz suspended the recently completed Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which would have made his country even more dependent on Russian energy, Germany is still paying Russia $220 million a day for energy — money that critics say is helping Moscow finance its invasion of Ukraine.
In contrast to the United States and much of the rest of Europe, Germany hesitated to sever banking ties with Russia and to provide any arms to Ukraine.
“Germany’s credibility as the champion of European values is under great pressure — other countries are growing very skeptical,” said Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe who is now a consultant in Germany.
“Germany should step up and offer to be the framework nation for air and missile defense for NATO’s eastern flank,” he said.
But the dominant feeling in Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party has been that instead of arming Ukraine, the West should do more to help Russia find a face-saving way to end the war.
The chancellor has offered multiple reasons for his opposition to sending heavy weapons. He said at first that he wanted to avoid escalating the war, then that he feared provoking Russia, finally arguing that it would take too long to train Ukrainian soldiers how to use the high-tech German tanks and other armaments.

Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is among German dignitaries and artists who have been ostracized or publicly dismissed in the last week because they decline to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We can’t have a nuclear war,” he said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine published Saturday.
The decision Tuesday to send tanks came at the U.S. air base in the small German town of Ramstein, where the United States held a summit to rally 40 countries to provide long-term military support to Ukraine.
“It would have been a total embarrassment for the German government to come to Ramstein, in their own country, still refusing to send heavy weapons to Ukraine,” Jaeger said. “They had to step up their game.”
He noted that most of the heavy weapons on Ukraine’s wish list from Germany were not approved for shipment to Ukraine.
“It looks like they agreed to send the least-useful heavy weapons under consideration,” he said. “It looks like this was just for the sake of appearances.”
Claudia Major, a defense policy expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said it could take weeks or month to ready the German tanks for battle.
“These are older models, and they need to be refurbished,” she said. “There are several other questions like ammunition, spare parts, maintenance and technical support that still need to be sorted out — and especially the training for the Ukrainian armed forces who haven’t yet worked with this system.”
Major said a German arms maker was holding the decommissioned tanks in storage and had made the offer to refurbish them six weeks ago.

Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

“The Defense Ministry has only now authorized this, or more precisely no longer prevented it,” she said.
Scholz was also facing a domestic rebellion before he bowed to the pressure. The Free Democratic Party and the Greens — both junior partners in his ruling coalition — had been pressing his party do more to support Ukraine.
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a leader of the Greens, said that the promise to send heavy weapons wasn’t a “snap decision” but  had been worked out with the United States and other allies and that there was no doubt that Germany was doing the right thing.
“Otherwise we would have had to tell Ukraine, ‘Go ahead fight on your own,’ and we didn’t want to do that,” she told Parliament on Wednesday. “We want to show our solidarity alongside Ukraine. We want to support Ukraine and its courageous fight for freedom and security in Europe.”
It remains unclear whether the public will eventually come around to that position.
“A lot of Germans think if we don’t hurt anyone else, no one will try to harm us,” Jaeger said. “Most Germans don’t think Ukraine can possibly win this war and a lot of them don’t want Ukraine to win — because they want to go back to business as usual with Russia.”"

Japan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia’s invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.
The video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia’s invasion and showed the three World War II-era leaders with the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945” underneath their photos.
Japan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a god until he renounced his divinity after Japan’s defeat. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided. He is known posthumously in Japan as Emperor Showa.
“Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,” Isozaki told reporters. “It was extremely regrettable.”
Isozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of the emperor’s image, which Ukraine has done.

Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.

“Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government tweeted Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.”

Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, also apologized in a tweet Monday, saying the creator of the video lacked an understanding of history.
Hirohito’s son, former Emperor Akihito, devoted his reign to atoning for the impact of the war in and outside Japan.
The video has been replaced with one without Hirohito’s photo, but many Japanese on social media continued to criticize the original as an insult and said Japan should stop supporting Ukraine. Others said Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged, would have been a better choice than Hirohito for the video.

The U.S. secretaries of State and Defense, after a high-level visit to Kyiv, vow to help Ukraine win the war and want to see Russia ‘weakened.’

Some, however, raised concern that Japan’s demand amounted to censorship and said Ukraine’s concession set a bad precedent that would embolden Japanese conservatives to further rewrite Japan’s wartime history.
Japan has worried that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could have an effect on East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has threatened to unite with Chinese-claimed Taiwan by force if necessary. Japan has tried to play a greater role as part of the Group of 7 industrialized nations in response to the invasion, joining a series of sanctions against Moscow and providing support for Ukraine in line with other members.
Japan provided $300 million for Ukraine and neighboring countries that have accepted displaced Ukrainians, and has also accepted hundreds of evacuees since Russia’s invasion began Feb. 24."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-26/explainer-how-is-trans-dniester-related-to-war-in-ukraine;2022-04-26;About 1,500 Russian troops already are stationed in Trans-Dniester - Los Angeles Times;"Among the sites of the former Soviet Union’s “frozen conflicts,” a long and narrow strip of land in Moldova has been the most stable for three decades. Transnistria hasn’t seen fighting since the end of a separatist war in 1992.
But explosions in the past two days have raised concerns that Russia’s war in Ukraine could extend there. About 1,500 Russian troops already are stationed in Transnistria. Another outbreak of hostilities would pose a severe challenge to Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries.
What is Transnistria?
Transnistria extends some 249 miles between the eastern bank of the Dniester River in Moldova and the country’s border with Ukraine. Most of the breakaway region’s population of 470,000 speaks Russian, although residents identify themselves as ethnically Moldovan, Ukrainian or Russian.
Moves to make Moldovan Moldova’s official language in 1989, when it still was part of the Soviet Union, alarmed people in Transnistria. The region declared independence in 1990 and clashes broke out. Fighting intensified in March 1992 and lasted until a July cease-fire; more than 700 people are estimated to have died in the conflict.
As part of the cease-fire agreement, a contingent of Russian troops stayed in Transnistria as nominal peacekeepers. Since then, the region has insisted it is not part of Moldova, which declared independence in 1991.
Transnistria has retained many Soviet ways and iconography, including using the hammer-and-sickle image on its flag. But it has remained generally peaceful, and some tourists come to relish the anachronisms.
What happened there this week?

Explosions rocked the headquarters of the region’s state security ministry on Monday. The building reportedly was empty due to the Orthodox Easter holiday, and no casualties were reported. Officials said the attackers used rocket-propelled grenades. Local media showed what appeared to be firing tubes lying on a street.
On Tuesday morning, a pair of explosions at a broadcasting facility knocked two powerful antennas out of service. No claims of responsibility for the attacks have been made.
Transnistria’s president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, called Tuesday for imposing anti-terrorist security measures at a “red level” for 15 days, including setting up checkpoints   at the entrances to cities.
The United States has warned amid the war in Ukraine that Russia could launch “false-flag” attacks in nearby nations as a pretext for sending in troops.
Does Russia have ambitions in the region?
Russia does not recognize Transnistria as independent, as it does with other breakaway areas, such as South Ossetia, Abkhazia and the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Its recognition of those areas came either after Russia and Georgia fought a 2008 war or as justification for Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. An outburst of fighting in Transnistria could change the Kremlin’s political calculus; Russia’s security policy states it has the right to protect ethnic Russian populations throughout the world.
A senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces were aiming to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would also open a land corridor between Russia and Transnistria, also known as Trans-Dniester.
Achieving that  objective would require significant military operations  to capture Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, including the major port city of Odesa. Russian soldiers would surely encounter enormous resistance.
“Russia has problems in logistics. If they begin a military operation in Trans-Dniester, to create a corridor to Trans-Dniester, they have to solve the problem of Odesa,” Moldovan analyst Anatol Taranu, a former ambassador to Russia, told the Associated Press.
The Russian military contingent stationed in Transnistria is focused on guarding ammunition and warehouses, and its fitness for combat is uncertain. Transnistria also has about 10,000 of its own soldiers.
Moldova is constitutionally neutral, so Russia could not cite the country seeking to join NATO to justify an invasion, as Russian President Vladimir Putin did with Ukraine. But expanding to Moldova would give Russia a presence next to NATO member Romania.
Taranu said that from a strategic point of view, taking Transnistria does not seem sensible.
“But there is a political logic,” he said, considering Russia’s failure to take control of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the intense resistance mounted by Ukrainian forces.
Putin “has to tell the public some success story,” Taranu said, noting that the Russian leader may want to claim some achievement on Victory Day, the May 9 observance that is Russia’s major secular holiday."

Waving signs that said “Stop Putin,” about 100 Ukrainian Americans and Russian Americans opposed to the invasion kicked things off about 10 a.m. with a march through Hollywood. Residents of apartment buildings along Hollywood Boulevard waved and shouted messages of support from their balconies to the group, which included several families with young children.
“Putin doesn’t speak for us,” said Erina Volodartseva, 32, who is Russian and brought along her children, ages 6 and 4. “We are against the war. Ukraine is our brother.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-26/russia-ukraine-war-pushes-up-cooking-oil-prices;2022-04-26;War in Ukraine raises cooking oil prices in global squeeze - Los Angeles Times;"For months, Istanbul restaurant Tarihi Balikca tried to absorb the surging cost of the sunflower oil its cooks use to fry fish, squid and mussels.
But in early April, with oil prices nearly four times higher than they were in 2019, the restaurant finally raised its prices. Now, even some longtime customers look at the menu and walk away.
“We resisted. We said, ‘Let’s wait a bit — maybe the market will improve, maybe [prices] will stabilize.’ But we saw that there is no improvement,” said Mahsun Aktas, a waiter and cook at the restaurant. “The customer cannot afford it.”
Global cooking oil prices have been rising since the COVID-19 pandemic began for multiple reasons, including poor harvests in South America, coronavirus-related labor shortages and steadily increasing demand from the biofuel industry. The war in Ukraine — which supplies nearly half of the world’s sunflower oil, with Russia supplying an additional 25% — has interrupted shipments and sent cooking oil prices spiraling.
It’s the latest fallout from the war for the global food supply, and another rising cost pinching households and businesses as inflation soars. The conflict has fueled already-high food and energy costs, hitting the poorest people the hardest.
The food supply is particularly at risk as the war has disrupted crucial grain shipments from Ukraine and Russia and worsened a global fertilizer crunch that will mean costlier, less abundant food. The loss of affordable supplies of wheat, barley and other grains raises the prospect of food shortages and political instability in Middle Eastern, African and some Asian countries where millions rely on subsidized bread and cheap noodles.

Politics
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen says finance leaders need to look for ways to combat food insecurity, which Russia’s war in Ukraine has made worse.

Vegetable oil prices hit a record high in February, then increased an additional 23% in March, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Soybean oil, which sold for $765 per metric ton in 2019, was averaging $1,957 per metric ton in March, the World Bank said. Palm oil prices were up 200% and are set to go even higher afterIndonesia, one of the world’s top producers, bans cooking oil exports starting Thursday to protect domestic supply.

Some supermarkets in Turkey have imposed limits on the amount of vegetable oil that households can purchase after concerns about shortages sparked panic-buying. Some stores in Spain, Italy and Britain also have set limits. German shoppers are posting photos on social media of empty shelves where sunflower and canola oil usually sit. In a recent tweet, Kenya’s main power company warned that thieves were draining toxic fluid from electrical transformers and reselling it as cooking oil.
“We will just have to boil everything now — the days of the frying pan are gone,” said Glaudina Nyoni, scanning prices in a supermarket in Harare, Zimbabwe, where vegetable oil costs have almost doubled since the outbreak of the war. A two-liter bottle now costs up to $9.
Emiwati, who runs a food stall in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, said she needs 24 liters of cooking oil each day. She makes nasi kapau, traditional mixed rice that she serves with dishes like deep-fried spiced beef jerky. Since January, she’s had trouble ensuring that supply, and what she does buy is much more expensive. Profits are down, but she fears losing customers if she raises prices.


Business
Airlines say they must go carbon-neutral to satisfy consumers and avoid harsh regulations. Biofuels can get the industry partway there, but it will also require technological breakthroughs.

“I am sad,” said Emiwati, who uses only one name. “We accept the price of cooking oil increasing, but we cannot increase the price of the foods we sell.”
The high cost of cooking oil is partly behind recent protests in Jakarta. Indonesia has imposed price caps on palm oil at home, and the ban on exports starting Thursday will create a new squeeze worldwide. Palm oil has been sought as an alternative to sunflower oil and is used in many products, from cookies to cosmetics.
Across the world in London, Yawar Khan, who owns Akash Tandoori restaurant, said a 20-liter drum of cooking oil cost him about $28 a few months ago; it’s now $49.
“We cannot pass all the price [rises] to the consumer. That will cause a catastrophe too,” said Khan, who also struggles with rising costs for meat, spices, energy and labor.

Food
Butter, oil, lard and other rendered animal fats can be used for frying, but different ones work best for different types of cooking.


Big companies are feeling the pain too. London-based Unilever, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, said it has contracts for crucial ingredients like palm oil for the first half of the year. But it warned investors that its costs could rise significantly in the second half.
Cargill, a global food giant that makes vegetable oils, said its customers are changing formulas and experimenting with different kinds of oils at a higher rate than usual. That can be tricky because oils have different properties: Olive oil burns at a lower temperature than sunflower oil, for example, while palm oil is more viscous.
Prices could moderate by this fall, when farmers in the Northern Hemisphere harvest corn, soybeans and other crops, said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. But there’s always the danger of bad weather. Last year, drought parched Canada’s canola crop and Brazil’s soybean crop.
Farmers may be hesitant to plant enough crops to make up for shortfalls from Ukraine or Russia because they don’t know when the war might end, said Steve Mathews, co-head of research at Gro Intelligence, an agriculture data and analytics company.

“If there were a cease-fire or something like that, we would see prices decline in the short run,” he said.
Longer term, the crisis may lead countries to reconsider biofuel mandates, which dictate the amount of vegetable oils that must be blended with fuel in a bid to reduce emissions and energy imports. In the U.S., for example, 42% of soybean oil goes toward biofuel production, Glauber said. Indonesia recently delayed a plan to require 40% palm-oil-based biodiesel, while the European Commission said it would support member states that choose to reduce their biofuel mandates.
In the meantime, consumers and businesses are struggling.
Harry Niazi, who owns Famous Olley’s Fish Experience in London, says he used to pay about $29 for a 20-liter jug of sunflower oil; the cost recently jumped to $55. Niazi goes through as many as eight jugs a week.

Politics
California has touched off a biofuel boom in pursuit of climate action. But environmental activists and analysts fear an unwelcome chain reaction in agriculture.


But what worries him even more than rising prices is the thought of running out of sunflower oil altogether. He’s thinking of selling his truck and using the cash to stock up on oil.
“It’s very, very scary, and I don’t know how the fish and chips industry is going to cope. I really don’t,” he said.
At Jordan’s Grab’n Go, a small restaurant in Dyersburg, Tenn., known for its fried cheeseburgers, owner Christine Coronado also agonizes about price increases. With costs up 20% across the board — and cooking oil prices nearly tripling since she opened in 2018 — she finally raised prices in April.
“You hate to raise prices on people, but it’s just that costs are so much higher than they were a couple of years ago,” she said."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-24/ukrainians-mark-a-somber-easter-as-top-u-s-officials-plan-visit-kyiv;2022-04-25;After Ukraine visit, Blinken and Austin vow to 'help them win' - Los Angeles Times;"Following the highest-level U.S. mission to Ukraine since the start of the war, the secretaries of State and Defense said Monday that the Biden administration was intent on helping the country win its war against Russia and on seeing Moscow “weakened to the point” where it cannot mount such aggression again.
To that end, the U.S. pledged an additional $300 million in military aid to Ukraine, promised to nominate an ambassador to Kyiv and said the U.S. Embassy there would reopen as soon as possible.
“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III told reporters Monday after crossing back into Poland from Ukraine. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can ... to ensure that gets to them.”
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who joined Austin on a trip shrouded in extraordinary security and much secrecy, declared that Russia was already falling short in its war aims.
“Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine, to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence. That has failed,” Blinken said. Austin added that the U.S. wanted “to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country” and also “to see Russia weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine.”
The two senior U.S. officials met for several hours with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who in recent weeks has hosted a number of Western leaders eager to show their support for Kyiv.
In addition to the new $300-million aid package for Ukraine, the U.S. pledged another $400 million in assistance to other NATO countries and allies who are providing equipment and assistance to the embattled nation.
The high-level U.S. visit came as fighting continued raging in the eastern and southern parts of the country and Ukrainians marked a somber Orthodox Easter.






The Biden administration has sent or committed $3.4 billion in armaments for Ukraine during the war, including two $800-million packages in the last 10 days that contained heavier materiel such as artillery, howitzers, tactical drones and combat helicopters.
Zelensky said more powerful weaponry was increasingly vital as Russia appears to be expanding its war goal to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine in addition to the eastern Donbas region.
Although U.S. officials did not comment publicly on the trip ahead of it, President Biden issued a statement Sunday praising the fact that Ukraine “still stands” as the war enters its third month.
“We will continue to support Ukrainians in their fight to defend their homeland,” Biden said.
As the mournful wail of sirens echoed through the emptied-out cities and towns of Ukraine’s east, Russian troops along a boomerang-shaped, 300-mile-long front line continued a fierce artillery barrage across Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces that make up the Donbas region, according to the Ukraine military’s general staff.
It added that Russia pressed on with its assault of the Azovstal steelworks plant — where the last of Ukrainian defenders in the southern city of Mariupol remain bunkered — and that it also had deployed Iskander-M mobile battlefield missile launchers some 40 miles from the Ukrainian border as part of an ongoing shelling campaign in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.
Senior presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Russian forces were “continuously attacking” the steel mill in Mariupol with bombs and artillery. Speaking on Twitter early Sunday, he pleaded for an Easter cease-fire, humanitarian escape corridors for civilians and a “special round of negotiations” to exchange military prisoners. Moscow has rejected all the demands, Ukrainian officials said.
Entering a third month, the invasion is spurring the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II with  more than 5 million fleeing the country and 6.5 internally displaced, according to the U.N. However, Russian troops are failing to make significant territorial gains because of a robust defense, Western officials say.
“Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,” the British Defense Ministry’s intelligence assessment said on Sunday.
World & Nation
Russian forces have more artillery, tanks and heavy fighting units than Ukraine, but they have been plagued by problems as they enter a pivotal battle for eastern Ukraine.

The visit by Blinken and Austin follows a stream of European leaders who have already made what has amounted to a pilgrimage of sorts to Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Several countries are also reestablishing their diplomatic missions in the capital — the latest being Britain — after having left ahead of the war. The Biden administration will be under pressure to follow suit. U.S. diplomats initially relocated to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then pulled out altogether to Poland.
Zelensky said he “expected specific things and specific weapons” when world leaders come, adding that he had seen an increase in both the amount and the speed of arms deliveries, especially from Washington.
“They should not come here with empty hands,” he said before the arrival of the U.S. officials, adding that Ukraine should not be used as a prop for “tragic selfies.” “We will return all our land the moment we receive necessary arms.”
In Kramatorsk, one of the prime targets in Russia’s new phase of the assault, only a few dozen residents attended Easter midnight Mass at the Syvato-Troyitskyy church, a reflection of the tense, fearful atmosphere engulfing the city as the battles edge ever closer. Approximately three-quarters of the city’s population has been evacuated.
“Of course people are afraid to go out, but it’s my responsibility to be here in the church, to remain close to God,” said Sergei Kapitonenko, a 44-year-old priest in Kramatorsk.
Easter is the most sacred holiday on the Orthodox Christian calendar but was marked this year at cemeteries, in the ruins of bombed churches and with prayers for the dead, the missing, the trapped and those fighting.
“We’re praying that God gives us quiet, and will kick out evil from the hearts of people, and give them understanding and forgiveness in their heart,” Kapitonenko said.
With services concluded, a few people came to the church to deliver baskets of colored Easter eggs and traditional Easter cakes decorated with sprinkles and icing as an offering to the needy.
World & Nation
Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.
For Kapitonenko, a kindly-looking man sporting a long beard inflected with a few strands of white, the last two months of the war had been “almost like a movie.”
“It’s unreal for me. It’s hard to understand what’s happening, that it could be like this,” he said.
Still, he chose to stay. The situation was still relatively quiet in Kramatorsk, he explained, and as long as the possibility was there to stay, he would.
“The people still here, they’re the children of the church,” he said. “And the father cannot leave them and run away elsewhere.”

Several hours to the west, in the river city of Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth largest on the edge of the Donbas region, hundreds of worshipers emerged early Sunday when an overnight curfew lifted at dawn to celebrate Easter at the Troitska Church, which was bathed in the light of hundreds of candles inside.
They circled the church carrying Easter baskets, filled with cakes, fruit and other goodies, each with its own candle. Normally the food would be blessed by the priest and then taken home to share within the family on Easter, but this year all the baskets are going to the soldiers on the front lines, the residents said.
Another 50 miles or so to the south, the checkpoint on the eastern edge of  Zaporizhzhia was quiet until early afternoon, when a police car, lights flashing, led a convoy of a dozen cars or more, all people escaping Russian occupation in the southern city of Melitopol, which fell to the Russians several weeks ago.
Tatyana Brogko, 42, was squeezed into the back seat of a car packed with five other members of her family. They escaped from  a resort town on the Sea of Azov also now held by Russians.
“I was so scared at the Russian checkpoints,” she said, wiping away tears of relief. “They were checking all the passports, checking the men for tattoos. I didn’t understand anything they were saying. There were 20 checkpoints. Thank God they didn’t do anything to us.”
Zaporizhzhia has become a way station for refugees fleeing Melitopol and Mariupol, with volunteers offering shelter, food and medical care.

Several of those arriving said they were taking advantage of the Easter holiday to escape, hoping the fighting would have calmed.
Zelensky issued an Easter message to his people. Speaking from the gold-domed St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, he noted the majestic house of worship survived invasions and occupations through the centuries and still stood strong — an analogy he made to the nation.
“We are enduring dark times,” Zelensky said, but added: “Today we all believe in a new victory for Ukraine. And we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or evil.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-12/how-to-investigate-alleged-chemical-attacks-in-ukraine;2022-04-13;How to investigate alleged Russian chemical attacks in Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Ukraine said Tuesday that it is investigating a claim that a poisonous substance was dropped on the besieged city of Mariupol. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said it was possible that phosphorus munitions — which cause horrendous burns but are not classified as chemical weapons — had been used.
Now the question is how to establish the truth amid the fog of war that has descended over a city still under attack from Russian forces. A clear answer is unlikely to emerge anytime soon.
The global chemical weapons watchdog said Tuesday that it is “concerned by the recent unconfirmed report of chemical weapons use in Mariupol” and is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine belong to the 193-member Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The  OPCW, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013, says that it “remains ready to assist any State Party upon its request, in case of use or threat of use of chemical weapons.”
First in line to investigate in Ukraine is the country’s own law enforcement agencies. There also are teams from other nations investigating allegations — particularly around the Ukrainian town of Bucha — of war crimes, and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation in Ukraine. The OPCW has, so far, not announced any investigations in Ukraine, although it says on its website that it “is monitoring the status of relevant chemical industrial facilities and any threats of use of toxic chemicals as weapons in the country.”
World & Nation
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol, as Russians use mobile cremation equipment to conceal war crimes, a city official says.


Marc-Michael Blum, former head of the OPCW’s laboratory and now an independent consultant, said the organization won’t send a team to Mariupol anytime soon to investigate.
“We have an active war zone where the OPCW would not send a team in because the security of the team cannot be guaranteed,” Blum told the Associated Press.
If a team of experts were able to investigate what was used and by whom, it would seek to build a dossier of evidence based on laboratory tests of samples collected at the scene and from victims. That means taking soil samples and testing them for traces of possible chemical weapons or other munitions. Samples of blood and urine from victims who were exposed to the munition would also be tested.

Then investigators would seek to interview witnesses and survivors, to build a picture of what they experienced, and the physicians who treated them. In past investigations, experts have studied gas dispersion models and topographic charts and looked at digital images. The OPCW has experience building such investigations in Syria, where its experts have confirmed the use of chemical weapons on multiple occasions.
Damascus denies using chemical weapons.
World & Nation
President Biden has flatly called Vladimir Putin a ‘war criminal’ after Russia bombed hospitals and maternity wards in Ukraine.


Hundreds of people were killed in gas poisoning attacks in Syria during the country’s civil war. The OPCW faced numerous hurdles and Russian vetoes complicating the establishment of investigation mechanisms. To this day, no one has been held accountable.
Two recent cases outside Syria show how a suspected chemical weapon use can be investigated by local authorities — the poisoning in 2020 of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in 2018.
In those cases, authorities in Germany, where Navalny went for treatment, and in the United Kingdom in the case of the Skripals, took and tested biological samples and concluded that they were targeted with a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok. In those cases, the OPCW tested the samples and confirmed the findings by national authorities.
Russia denied involvement in both attacks.
Phosphorus munitions are not considered chemical weapons. Most armies have phosphorus munitions to use for illuminating battlefields or targets or to produce smoke screens. However, if an army deliberately fired a phosphorus munition into an enclosed space in order to expose people to toxic fumes, it could be a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Blum.
“Once you start using the properties of white phosphorus, toxic properties, specifically and deliberately, then it becomes banned,” he said.
Politics
In Russia’s war in Ukraine, investigators are able to collect evidence of war crimes “in real time,” lawyers and experts say, giving hope of more timely justice.


Blum is not optimistic. Given that the current situation in Mariupol is “almost impossible to really pin down,” he said he has “no high hopes” for any kind of investigation."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-03-30/ukraine-war-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelensky-peace-talks-turkey-economic-sanctions;2022-03-30;Op-Ed: How does the war in Ukraine end? - Los Angeles Times;"Vladimir Putin is in a predicament. In the first 20 days of fighting, by one conservative Pentagon estimate, more than 7,000 Russian troops were killed — greater than 20 years of U.S. losses in Afghanistan and Iraq. NATO’s figures are even higher — up to 40,000 Russians killed, wounded, missing or taken prisoner. Retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus assessed it simply: The Russians, and Ukrainians, are stuck in “a bloody stalemate.”
“Tell me how this ends” was a Petraeus catchphrase when he served as a major general early in the Iraq war. Applied to the war in Ukraine, answers are starting to appear.
The West’s economic attacks aren’t going to halt the fighting. The world’s condemnation of Putin has been unified, swift and ever-increasing, but sanctions can do little to hasten the outcome in the short term. We in the West place too much faith in frozen bank accounts and the ruble tanking. We are mirror-imaging, imagining that if we faced the same hardships as the Russians, we’d demand our government retreat right away. But we aren’t Russian. At best, sanctions are one factor, not the thing that pushes the parties to serious talks.
Battlefield success isn’t doing it either. Neither side can militarily defeat their opponent.
World & Nation
Moscow says it will scale back its offensive around the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv in part to give more impetus to peace talks.

The Russians don’t have the capacity for an outright victory in conventional warfare. Experts from the beginning have noted that Russia lacks the troops on the ground to seize cities and hold terrain. No amount of scorched-earth threats — chemical, biological or tactical nuclear weapons — will change the fact that Russia cannot control Ukraine without calling up conscripts, which would further devastate its economy.
As for the much-smaller Ukrainian forces, even with infusions of materiel from the West and their remarkable resilience thus far, they also would not win a war of attrition, even if it went on for years.
But hope lies in facts on the ground. Call it diplomacy forced by force.

War is many awful things, but it at least reveals raw truths to the combatants. Whatever wishful falsehoods the parties told themselves about their strengths and their adversary’s weaknesses pre-contact, fighting dispels them. It is objective. It focuses the public mind; it makes it so that political leaders cannot avoid hard calls they otherwise might ignore.
In 2009, the U.S. Army commissioned more than a dozen top historians to review how America ends its wars. The study covered conflicts as far back as the Revolutionary War, right up to the moment the question was posed. It identified important patterns, summarized in an essay by military historian Roger Spiller.
“Wars are defined,” wrote Spiller, “not by their extremes but by their limitations.” “No matter how unyielding or uncompromising” a war’s initial aims may be, they “are constantly revised by the stresses and actions of war.” And all sides “gradually converge toward an agreement to stop fighting.”
That may be what we’re seeing now — a willingness to concede previously untouchable topics in light of newly realized pain and failure.
Diplomats from the two sides met in Turkey on Tuesday. Russia said it was ready to set a meeting between Putin and Zelensky when a draft peace agreement is ready. A deputy Russian defense minister claimed Russia would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, a significant shift from a month ago, when the rough rhetoric of regime change and the subjugation of all Ukraine headed the Kremlin’s talking points.
Zelensky has already signaled flexibility on Ukraine’s goal of joining NATO and suggested a framework for “discussions” on Crimea and the Donbas.
Handicapping outcomes at this early stage amounts to strategic malpractice, but we know how the road to peace must be built.
It begins with Putin accepting that what he reached for is more than his army can hold. The bargaining will not look kind or generous on Russia’s part, but Putin will have to concede enough to convince Zelensky to call off the rhetorical, financial and diplomatic dogs.
Then attention shifts to Zelensky. Only he can bring the world back to Russia. That’s his leverage in the negotiations. Putin may have more rockets and RPGs, but Zelensky’s golden voice currently commands the globe.
It is Zelensky’s say-so that will unwind what Putin calls the West’s “economic blitzkrieg.” Zelensky alone can coax back the hundreds of global companies that have fled Russia (and Ukraine). These companies left because of an illegal war, and they will only return for a just peace, which requires more than just the two parties at the signing ceremony.
The last hurdle will be convincing the Ukrainian people to accept a bargain. Whatever specific deal emerges, it will contain shattering concessions. Every inch of Ukrainian ground given up will seem like sacred soil. The terms will feel like surrender, and it will be a Herculean task for the millions whose lives have been destroyed by Russia’s hubris to agree that any compromise could possibly be worth what’s been sacrificed.
That may be the toughest challenge Zelensky has yet faced. Because war is hard, peace is hard.

Blinken declared Monday that “Russia is failing” in its war aims, as new fighting flared in Ukraine’s eastern battle zone and Russian forces reportedly aimed a round of airstrikes at railway facilities in the country’s west and center.
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, who traveled with Blinken to the Ukrainian capital to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, made clear that Washington‘s goals extend far beyond seeing Ukraine repel Moscow’s forces.
For the record:
8:09 a.m. April 25, 2022In an earlier version of this article, remarks about Washington wanting to see Russia “weakened” were incorrectly attributed to Antony J. Blinken. They were said by Lloyd J. Austin III.
He said he wanted to see Russia “weakened to the point” where it cannot mount such aggression again.
Blinken and Austin made their remarks to reporters after crossing into Poland from Ukraine, following the first official U.S. visit to Kyiv since the war began two months ago. In a show of support, the two announced a fresh infusion of $300 million in military aid and a revived U.S. diplomatic presence in Ukraine.
“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Austin said after the visit. “We believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can ... to ensure that gets to them.”
World & Nation
Russian forces have more artillery, tanks and heavy fighting units than Ukraine, but they have been plagued by problems as they enter a pivotal battle for eastern Ukraine.


Zelensky, in an address to his nation Monday, thanked Biden and the people of the U.S. for “the strong and sincere” support.
“These are real things that strengthen not only our state, but democracy as a whole,” he said. “We share the same understanding with the United States: When democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world.”
The coming weeks will probably be critical militarily, analysts say, with Russia having announced its determination to seize the entire Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. Moscow last week also signaled aspirations to win control of the country’s southern seacoasts, which would render Ukraine landlocked, crippling it economically.

The war, which has killed thousands and created an immense humanitarian disaster, has also sparked a refugee crisis whose scale has not been seen on the European continent since World War II.
Nearly 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled into exile, according to the latest figures from the United Nations refugee agency, and almost 8 million others are internally displaced, according to separate estimates from the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.
At the same time, there have been few major shifts on the battlefields. In the week since Russia embarked on a redoubled offensive in the east, its forces have made only “minor advances” along a 300-mile battle front, Britain’s military intelligence said in an assessment Monday.
“Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough,” the assessment said.
Zelensky lauded the successes of Ukrainian forces in his nightly video address, noting that 931 settlements in Ukraine had been liberated after temporary occupation by Russia.
“Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,” he said. “But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land.”
World & Nation
Finland has long seen Russia as a threat. Now politicians and ordinary Finns are saying it aloud.

Russia’s missteps have inflicted a steep toll on its troops. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in the House of Commons on Monday that about 15,000 have been killed and that about 25% of Russian battalion tactical groups sent to Ukraine have been “rendered not combat effective” as Russia has lost more than 2,000 armored vehicles and 60 helicopters and fighter planes.
Still, Moscow last week claimed what would be its biggest victory of the war: control of the strategic southern port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Ukrainian defenders continue to hold a last redoubt, a sprawling steelworks plant, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to blockade.
Russia’s military Monday said it would temporarily halt hostilities at the plant to allow civilians also sheltering inside to be brought out safely. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency as saying civilians who emerged would be transported in any direction they chose.
Ukraine swiftly spurned the Russian offer, with its deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, saying on Telegram that a unilaterally announced evacuation plan “does not provide security.” Kyiv for weeks has accused Moscow of sending thousands of Ukrainians trying to flee Mariupol to Russian-controlled areas or to Russia itself.

Putin’s order to besiege rather than directly attack the giant Azovstal plant means that “many Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed,” the British assessment said. The fight for Mariupol, it added, has “exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.”
Mariupol remains largely cut off from the outside world, but may prove the scene of the war’s worst mass atrocities against civilians. Municipal authorities say an estimated 20,000 people have died in bombardment or of hunger and privation since the city came under attack in the first days of the war.
In his remarks in Poland, Blinken hammered on the theme that Moscow, despite superior firepower, has not succeeded in subduing its smaller neighbor. So far in the war, Russia has ravaged whole Ukrainian cities but also suffered setbacks, including a failed bid to capture Kyiv and the loss of its Black Sea flagship to what Ukrainian and Western officials said was a missile attack.
World & Nation
President Biden’s decision to dramatically ramp up delivery of artillery guns to Ukraine comes at a potentially crucial point in the war.

“When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding,” Blinken said. “Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine, to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence. That has failed.”
Following Blinken’s announcement of a renewed U.S. diplomatic presence in Ukraine, the White House said that President Biden would nominate Bridget Brink, currently the U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as the next U.S. ambassador to Kyiv. The post has remained officially vacant since the previous ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was removed by then-President Trump three years ago.
Western unity over the war has been a linchpin of the Biden administration’s policy toward Putin, acting in concert to punish Russia economically and provide Ukraine with weapons.
Most European Union leaders were relieved after French President Emmanuel Macron won reelection Sunday over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who threatened to upend that solidarity.
Politics
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has now brought about a sea change in U.S. foreign policy.

Zelensky tweeted his congratulations to Macron, calling him, in French, a “true friend” of Ukraine. Putin, whose cordial relationship with Le Pen became a campaign issue, also congratulated Macron.
As fighting continued to rage, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that overnight and early Monday, its air force hit 56 targets it described as Ukrainian military infrastructure. Moscow also claimed to have hit a big oil refinery northwest of the central city of Dnipro.
Dnipro itself — a city of almost a million people that some consider the gateway to the Donbas region — felt almost normal, with shops open, restaurants operating and even traffic on the streets. By contrast, another key Donbas city, Kramatorsk, heard a steady soundtrack of explosions and sirens reverberating across abandoned roads.
Reflecting concerns about stepped-up Russian attacks outside the eastern battle zone, the Kyiv regional administration said that starting Monday, the capital will be placed under an ongoing curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Russia broke off its attempt to capture Kyiv nearly a month ago.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials took stock of death and damage from airstrikes that rained down unabated Sunday, when Eastern rite Christians celebrated Easter.
Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas, came under heavy shelling on the holiday, provincial Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote Monday on Telegram. He said structures set ablaze included three high-rise buildings and four private homes.
The war also appeared to spill across Ukraine’s southwestern border Monday afternoon into Transnistria, a Russia-aligned breakaway enclave of Moldova. Several explosions rocked a security agency building in the region’s capital, Tiraspol. The local ministry of internal affairs said in a statement there were no injuries and initial data indicated the shots were fired from rocket-propelled grenades.
Ukraine’s intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense claimed in a Facebook post that the explosions were a “planned provocation” carried out by Russian intelligence services. Russia did not comment on the attacks. Last week, a senior Russian military official told state media that Russia’s goal was to seize full control of southern Ukraine and open a land corridor to Transnistria.

As investigators gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine, family members visit mass graves and claim their dead in suburbs of Kyiv.

Reports also emerged early Monday that five railway facilities in the country’s west and center had come under fire, causing a yet-undetermined number of casualties. The head of Ukraine’s railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin, said information about the attacks was still being gathered.
One of the strikes was reported to have hit not far from Lviv, Ukraine’s main western hub, which has largely escaped the brunt of the fighting. The regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, said a missile struck a rail facility at Krasne, about 25 miles east of Lviv, setting it ablaze.
Earlier this month, in one of the most devastating single attacks of the war, about 60 people were killed at a train station in Kramatorsk as they waited for transportation out of the battle zone.
In striking at critical transportation infrastructure, Russia likely sought to disrupt Ukrainian reinforcements and logistics and demonstrate its ability to interfere with Western aid shipments, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in an assessment.
However, the analysts concluded: “Russian precision strike capabilities will remain limited and unlikely to decisively affect the course of the war.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-12/jews-fleeing-ukraine-passover;2022-04-12;For Jews fleeing Ukraine, Passover takes on new meaning - Los Angeles Times;"“Good morning! Happy morning!” Rabbi Avraham Wolff exclaimed, with a big smile, as he walked into the Chabad synagogue in Odesa on a recent morning.
Russian missiles had just struck an oil refinery in the Ukrainian city, turning the sky charcoal gray. Hundreds were lining up outside his synagogue hoping to receive a kilo of matzah each for their Passover dinner tables. The unleavened flatbread, imperative at the ritual meal known as a Seder, is now hard to find in war-torn Ukraine amid a crippling food shortage.
But the rabbi wanted no challenge to get him down — be it the lack of matzah or that he was missing his wife and children who had fled the Black Sea port for Berlin days ago.
“I need to smile for my community,” Wolff said. “We need humor. We need hope.”
Tens of thousands of Ukrainian Jews have fled while about 80% remain in Ukraine, according to estimates from Chabad, one of the largest Hasidic Jewish organizations in the world. Inside and outside Ukraine, a nation steeped in Jewish history and heritage, people are preparing to celebrate Passover, which begins sundown on April 15. It has been a challenge, to say the least.
The holiday marks the liberation of Jewish people from slavery in ancient Egypt, and their exodus under the leadership of Moses. The story is taking on special meaning for thousands of Jewish Ukrainian refugees who are living a dramatic story in real time.
World & Nation
In a rapidly growing wave, thousands of Ukrainian Jews have fled to Israel.


Chabad, which has deep roots and a wide network in Ukraine, and other groups such as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Jewish Federations of North America, have mobilized to help Ukrainian Jews celebrate Passover wherever they have sought refuge. In Ukraine, Chabad plans 52 public Seders welcoming about 9,000 people.
In Odesa, Wolff is preparing to host two large Seders — one in early evening at the Chabad synagogue for families with young children and a later Seder at a hotel where participants can stay the night, obeying a 9 p.m. curfew.
He’s been waving in trucks loaded with Passover supplies — matzah from Israel, milk from France, meat from Britain.

“We may not all be together, but it’s going to be an unforgettable Passover,” Wolff said. “This year, we celebrate as one big Jewish family around the world.”
JDC, which has evacuated more than 11,600 Jews from Ukraine, has shipped more than 2 tons of matzah, over 400 bottles of grape juice and over 700 pounds of kosher Passover food for refugees in Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania, said Chen Tzuk, the organization’s director of operations in Europe, Asia and Africa. In Ukraine, their social service centers and corps of volunteers are distributing nearly 16 tons of matzah to elderly Jews and families in need, she said.
“Passover is something familiar and basic for Jewish people,” Tzuk said. “For refugees who have left everything behind, it’s important to be able celebrate this holiday with honor and dignity.”
World & Nation
President Biden, in a speech on rising gas prices, says Russia’s actions in Ukraine amount to ‘genocide,’ a term the administration has previously avoided.

JDC is organizing in-person Seders in countries bordering Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, she said, and is facilitating online Seders where it’s too dangerous to gather in person.
The Jewish Federations of North America has set up a volunteer hub in support of refugees fleeing Ukraine; it’s a partnership with the Jewish Agency for Israel, the JDC and IsraAID. Russian-speaking volunteers, such as Alina Spaulding, will help organize a Seder for 100 refugees at a hotel in Budapest.
Spaulding, a resident of Greensboro, N.C., fled Kharkiv, Ukraine, as a 5-year-old in the 1970s with her parents. She said the war has rekindled strong connections to Ukraine.
“My mom showed me a photo of me with my grandpa on a street that was recently bombed,” Spaulding said. “We talked about the university in Kharkiv where my mom and dad went, which was also hit. Suddenly, it all felt so personal.”
Spaulding believes spending Passover with refugees will be “an experience to remember.”
World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

“Part of the magic of Passover is finding your own story,” she said. “We’re in the middle of a modern-day exodus. I can’t even imagine the stories I will hear.”
Celebrating a holiday can give people a rush of hope and happiness even in grim situations, said Rabbi Jacob Biderman, who leads Chabad activities throughout Austria, including a center in Vienna that is sheltering about 800 Ukrainian Jews. Days after refugees reached his center, Biderman led a joyous celebration of Purim, a festival commemorating the deliverance of Jews from a planned massacre in ancient Persia.
“The look on their faces changed from sorrow to joy. ... Their eyes lit up,” Biderman said. “It gave them a sense of normalcy, dignity and the belief that their spiritual life is something no one can take away from them.”
That fueled Biderman’s determination to provide a memorable Passover Seder for the refugees.

The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was under Russian siege and bombardment for 38 days


Dr. Yaacov Gaissinovitch, his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children — ages 11, 8 and 4 — will be part of that celebration. They fled the Ukrainian city of Dnipro by car on March 4, a Friday. Gaissinovitch, a urologist and mohel who performs the Jewish rite of circumcision, said it pained him, as an observant Jew, to drive on Shabbat — a forbidden act on the day of rest and prayer except when lives are at stake.
“I drove nonstop for 12 hours to Moldova to save us all,” he said. “We sang all the Shabbat songs in the car. It was very, very hard.”
In Dnipro, Gaissinovitch had his offices in the sprawling Menorah Center, which serves as a center of Jewish life, housing a synagogue, shops, restaurants, museums and the office of the city’s chief rabbi.
After a month of being severed from everything familiar, the Chabad center in Vienna has been a blessing, Gaissinovitch said.
“We’ve been accepted here very warmly,” he said. “After being disconnected for days, the children have been able to see that our life hasn’t stopped.”
A similar community at the Chabad center in Berlin is housing about 1,000 refugees, including Rabbi Avraham Wolff’s wife and children from Odesa. The center plans to host eight Seders citywide and has distributed matzah and other food to community members. Refugees, including 120 children from an Odesa orphanage who arrived in Berlin along with Wolff’s family, distributed the items to locals, said Yehuda Teichtal, the chief rabbi of Berlin.
“To me, this is extremely touching,” he said. “That people on the receiving end are able to give and not be viewed as victims. It’s empowering and energizing.”
As they prepare for Passover, Teichtal, Biderman and Wolff said they have been inspired by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who was among the most influential global leaders in Judaism in modern times. April 5 marked the rabbi’s 120th birth anniversary, a special number in Jewish tradition.
The rabbi “built a strong foundation [in Ukraine] so we’re able to do what we’re doing now,” Wolff said.
Schneerson grew up in Ukraine during a challenging time in the former Soviet Union, Teichtal said.
“In spite of all the darkness, his focus was selflessness, dedication, love for all humanity and the unwavering faith that we are going to overcome,” Teichtal said."

It wasn’t the first time.
“If anyone decides to meddle [in Ukraine] and create unacceptable strategic threats for Russia, they must know our response will be lightning-quick,” Putin said Wednesday. “We have all the tools for this … and we will use them if we have to.”

Politics
Young Americans say politics is bad for their mental health. Democrats’ chances depend on keeping them engaged nonetheless.

Two days earlier, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov delivered the same message a little more diplomatically.
“The risk is serious, real. It should not be underestimated,” Lavrov said. “Under no circumstances should a third World War be allowed to happen.”
Nuclear saber-rattling is an unattractive habit, and Putin and his aides resort to it often. In 2008, they warned Poland that it would risk annihilation if it joined a U.S.-sponsored missile-defense program. (The Poles joined anyway.) In 2014, they warned that an attempt to push Russia out of Crimea, which they had grabbed from Ukraine, could trigger a nuclear response.
And in February, as he launched his invasion of Ukraine, Putin ordered his unhappy-looking defense minister to raise Russia’s nuclear forces to “strategic combat readiness.”
The elaborate threat appeared intended to frighten the United States and its European allies away from the war. Once again, the threat didn’t work.
U.S. officials said they didn’t take Putin’s threat literally, perhaps because they had heard it before. CIA Director William Burns dismissed it as “rhetorical posturing,” noting that Russia hadn’t visibly readied its nuclear forces.

There is one form of nuclear warfare, however, that Burns and others consider a more imminent threat: tactical nuclear weapons, relatively small warheads designed mainly to be used on a battlefield, not to level an entire city.
“Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” Burns said last month.
Russia has more than 2,000 battlefield nuclear weapons, and their use is a routine part of Moscow’s war planning and military training.
The devices are small only in comparison with the missile-borne warheads that Russia and the United States have aimed at each other since the Cold War.
Many “low-yield” nukes are almost as powerful as the bomb the United States dropped in 1945 on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, killing at least 70,000. Some are larger.
The scenario U.S. officials and outside experts worry most about is this:
If Putin faces a humiliating defeat in Ukraine, he might order the use of tactical nuclear weapons against military units or cities to try to shock the Ukrainians into surrendering.
Even if a “low-yield” detonation did not compel Ukraine to surrender, it would break a globally observed taboo on nuclear warfighting that has held, almost miraculously, since 1945.
So President Biden has issued a warning to Putin in return — but it has been deliberately quieter than the Russian threats.
“With respect to any use of weapons of mass destruction — nuclear, chemical, biological — Russia would pay a severe price,” national security advisor Jake Sullivan said in March.
One diplomat told me he believes Biden has asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Putin’s most important global ally, to send the same message.
Stanford nuclear scholar Scott Sagan has suggested another step — private warnings to Russian military leaders that they would be held responsible for war crimes if they used tactical nuclear weapons against civilian targets.
“The United States has a long history of hunting down war criminals,” he told me. “Russian generals may be reluctant to cross the nuclear threshold ... and the United States should reinforce that reluctance by adding very personal reasons for restraint.”
What happens if deterrence fails?
Harvard strategist Graham Allison posed a difficult version of the question last month: If Russia detonated a nuclear warhead, then challenged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “to agree to a cease-fire or wait to see what a Ukrainian Nagasaki looks like, what would the United States and NATO do?”
Just as in the bad old days of the Cold War, we are being forced to think the unthinkable.
Part of the answer may be counterintuitive: If Russia uses nuclear weapons, the United States need not — and should not — respond in kind.
U.S. nuclear retaliation could launch a tit-for-tat cycle of escalation and lead to a global holocaust.
And it wouldn’t be necessary. The United States and its allies have conventional weapons that could destroy Russia’s ability to continue the war in Ukraine.
“The response to a tactical nuclear weapon does not have to be nuclear,” Sagan said. “There are lots of conventional responses that would be very harmful to the Russian military. ... The Russian base where their nuclear attack originated could be suddenly destroyed, or many Russian warships could be suddenly sunk.”
Even after a Russian nuclear strike, in other words, Ukraine and its allies could still pursue their goals — to turn back the Russian invasion, secure Ukraine’s sovereignty and give Putin a black eye.
With luck, those hard questions won’t need to be confronted.
But if Putin is backed into a corner — even though it will be a product of his own brutal mistakes — he’ll be even more dangerous than he is today.
That’s the warning he’s been sending all along."

Alexander was born in Orange County, but on that day in December, authorities told Quintana he would not be allowed to leave the country with his son and would have to surrender the boy to his grandmother in Ukraine.
A year earlier, Quintana’s estranged wife, Antonina Aslanova, had abducted their son from his Aliso Viejo apartment amid their divorce and fled to her home country, Orange County prosecutors say. She took Alexander to Mariupol, the port city that is now being bombarded by Russian artillery.
Now Quintana, 35, plans to travel into the war zone to find his son. He’s unsure what awaits him — or even whether his estranged wife and Alexander are among the millions of refugees who have fled Ukraine.
The last time he saw Alexander was during a brief video call March 2, six days after Russia launched its invasion.
“Like you say in the Army, never leave a man behind. But that’s my son,” Quintana told The Times. “I know there’s worry of life or death. But that’s my son. I can’t just leave him. I can’t.”

World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

He plans to travel to Poland and then to Ukraine as a volunteer with a humanitarian aid group. To him, there are no other options.
This week, Quintana went to the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., to sign up to enter Ukraine as part of a humanitarian mission.

Joining him on his trip was Noelle Hunter, co-founder of iStand Parent Network, a nonprofit that assists parents in cases of parental child abduction.
Hunter said Quintana’s situation was difficult because of the war but not entirely uncommon. Her own ex-husband had joint custody of their daughter when he fled to Mali in 2011, less than a year before war broke out there and the president was ousted in a coup. After a campaign similar to Quintana’s, Hunter was reunited with her daughter when the courts in Mali ruled in her favor.
“Like any parent, Cesar is going to the ends of the earth for his son,” Hunter told The Times.
Quintana said he was recovering from gallbladder surgery the day Aslanova took their son in December 2020. When he woke up, his apartment was empty, and he messaged Aslanova that he would call the police if she didn’t immediately return, according to a letter from Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamara Jacobs to the U.S. State Department.
While Quintana and Aslanova were going through their divorce, she was allowed supervised visits with Alexander under court order. By December 2020, Quintana had full custody of Alexander, according to the Orange County district attorney’s office.
World & Nation
Russian missiles hit an aircraft repair facility near Lviv’s airport in Ukraine, bringing the war within miles of the eastern border of NATO.


Aslanova lost custody after multiple convictions for driving under the influence, according to court records and the letter from the district attorney’s office.
Quintana said he thinks Aslanova’s mother was the driving force behind Alexander’s abduction. He told Aslanova he was reluctant to leave Alexander alone with her mother, he said, adding that after his son was taken to Ukraine, his mother-in-law demanded money for him to see the boy.
“My mother-in-law is the one who has been in control of that baby,” Quintana said. “She’s been the one who has extorted me for cash, time and time again, for my son.”
A warrant was issued for Aslanova by an Orange County Superior Court judge after she fled the country, and both parents have appeared remotely in family court. Aslanova was charged with child abduction by county prosecutors.
Quintana’s attorney in Orange County has attempted to bring Alexander back to the U.S. under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which is a treaty that allows for the return from one member country to another of children abducted by a parent across an international boundary. Ukraine is a signatory to the treaty.
Though Quintana is Alexander’s legal guardian and obtained a court order from a U.S. judge for custody, he was stopped twice in the last year while trying to leave Ukraine with his son.
According to a Feb. 15 letter from the State Department to the office of Rep. Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), Quintana did not have Aslanova’s consent to take Alexander back to the U.S. or the approval of Ukrainian authorities, and would need to follow a legal process to bring his son home.
“Attempts to remove the child to the United States may endanger the child and others, prejudice any future judicial efforts, and could result in arrest and imprisonment,” wrote April Conway, an official with the State Department’s Office of Children’s Issues.
In 2020, the State Department handled more than 660 international child abduction cases, with 246 new cases opened that year, 129 cases resolved and 185 children returned to the United States. Hunter, of iStand Parent Network, said she believes many more abduction cases are not reported.
Hunter said she warned Quintana of the danger in his plan to search for his son in Ukraine.
“I explained to Cesar the task he was setting out on, but he is a smart man and a determined father,” Hunter said.
Civilian casualties in Ukraine have mounted as Russian forces attack hospitals, theaters and other locations where civilians are sheltering.
Quintana understands that he will be stepping into a war zone.
“Our government is so concerned with the defense of Ukraine, but I wish they would show even a fraction of concern for one of their own citizens who is a victim of kidnapping,” he said.
As the war rages on, Quintana can only think of holding his son again and leaving Ukraine together."

Russia, a declining power, seemed almost an afterthought. All Biden wanted from Moscow, he said last year, was “a stable, predictable relationship.”

Politics
The House will be more proportionate by some measures, but also more partisan and even more prone to gridlock.

Vladimir Putin had other ideas. Two months ago, Putin invaded Ukraine — and the result has been not only a tragic war, but a sea change in U.S. policy.
The struggle for Ukraine is now Biden’s main national security focus. The United States and Russia appear locked in a long-term confrontation reminiscent of the 20th century’s Cold War. The challenge of China is still out there, but strategists who hoped to shift U.S. troops from Europe to Asia have put those plans on hold.
Last week, Biden announced that he was sending an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, bringing the total over the last two months to more than $3 billion. More important than the dollar figure were the weapons included: heavy artillery, helicopters, armored personnel carriers, antiaircraft radar systems and the Phoenix Ghost, a new kamikaze attack drone.
The shopping list reflected a gradual escalation since the opening weeks of the war, when Biden and his aides emphasized the limits of what the United States was willing to do — in part to avoid risking direct conflict between Russian forces and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
There would be no boots on the ground, they said, no long-range offensive weapons, and no U.S.-enforced “no-fly zone” to stop Russia’s air force from bombing Ukrainian cities. Nor would the United States agree to move MiG-29 aircraft from Poland through Germany to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and American hawks complained, but last week, Zelensky said the new aid package was “just what we were waiting for.”
What changed? As Ukraine’s armed forces performed better than expected — and Russia’s performed worse — the administration’s commitment to Kyiv deepened.
“Our policy is unequivocal that we will do whatever we can to help Ukraine succeed,” Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said in a TV interview. “At the end of the day, what we want to see is a free and independent Ukraine [and] a weakened and isolated Russia.”
The administration’s attitude was also hardened, he added, by “what the Russians have done, frankly — killing civilians, atrocities, war crimes.”
More broadly, Biden’s commitment to Ukraine appears to signal the end of a period of retrenchment in which Presidents Obama and Trump sought to disengage from the military entanglements launched by President George W. Bush.
Columbia University scholar Stephen Sestanovich has long argued that U.S. foreign policy tends to alternate between cycles of assertive international engagement, which he calls “maximalism,” and retrenchment.
“What puts an end to retrenchment is almost always some sort of shock,” he told me last week, something that “makes people think that downsized policies, however desirable they might have seemed a few years earlier, just won’t cut it in a more dangerous world.”
“Putin’s war has been exactly that sort of mind-focusing stimulus, and its effects are likely to be lasting ones,” he said.
If he’s right, the broader effects of the Ukraine crisis could include a Cold War-style division of the world into two blocs, one led by the United States, the other by China and Russia; long-term pressure from Congress for higher defense spending; and perhaps even a modest revival of bipartisanship in foreign policy.
Those trends will all feel familiar to Biden, who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the last half of the Cold War. A year or two ago, his fondness for NATO and other traditional U.S. alliances may have sounded like a throwback, but it has come in handy now.
He and his aides worked to focus NATO on Putin’s threats long before the invasion, enabling the alliance to impose coordinated sanctions as soon as the tanks rolled. His old-fashioned return to alliance-building turned out to be exactly what the West needed.
Biden’s foreign policy has been far from perfect. His withdrawal from Afghanistan, to take only the most painful example, was a fiasco.
But in Ukraine, at least, the president’s experience and instincts have served him well."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-04-11/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-has-also-made-it-a-pariah-in-space;2022-04-11;Russia's Ukraine invasion has escalated a brewing battle over space - Los Angeles Times;"A 57-second video posted by the Russian government last month caught the attention of scientists and diplomats, but not in a way that inspired optimism about the future of global cooperation in outer space.
In it, Russian cosmonauts floated about the International Space Station, hugging and waving goodbye to an American astronaut. Then they entered their portion of the complex and sealed airlock doors behind them. With the video blasting a Russian song, “Farewell,” CGI took over and depicted the cosmonaut’s segment detaching from the station and drifting away (to the applause of Russian ground controllers).
The dark yet jaunty satirical video, depicting what would be the certain demise of the station, presaged more serious threats to an endeavor that has come to symbolize post-Cold War cooperation in space.
It is also a further sign that friction with the Kremlin, most recently aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has seeped into space, exacerbating tensions over the rules of behavior there and halting negotiations over space weapons at a time when the battlegrounds of war are moving to the edges of Earth’s atmosphere.
“The whole world is sort of readjusting to this whole notion of not just competition, but possible and even unintentional confrontation with other big powers” over how they use space, said Jessica West, a senior researcher with Project Ploughshares, a peace research group based in Canada.
Space has long been a barometer of the U.S.-Russia relationship. Cold War competition pushed Moscow and Washington toward new human feats in the 1960s, including the U.S. moon landing in 1969. Anxiety over President Reagan’s “Star Wars” defensive weapons program drove arms negotiations in the 1980s that presaged the end of the Soviet Union.
The 1998 space station agreement — which also includes the European Union, Japan and Canada — signaled a new era of shared advancement in the post-Cold War period. For more than two decades, the jointly operated station has been spinning around Earth.
That space détente was waning long before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and the U.S. and its allies targeted Moscow’s space industry in a raft of economic sanctions. For two decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed for an aggressive expansion of his country’s space weapons program.

American officials have alleged, starting in 2009, that the Kremlin was developing anti-satellite missiles and more recently an anti-satellite mobile laser.
Russia launched what it described as an inspector satellite in 2017, prompting deep skepticism from American officials over what they labeled the craft’s “abnormal behavior,” suggesting it may also have a military use. Two years later, Russia placed a satellite within close range of a U.S. spy satellite, prompting concerns of an unintentional confrontation between the two military powers.
In November, Russia tested a missile that struck a satellite and blasted it into more than 1,500 large pieces of debris, any chunk of which could doom manned and unmanned commercial and military spacecraft, including the crew of the space station, which was forced to take shelter.
The U.S. and its allies sharply criticized Russia over the test, with Vice President Kamala Harris calling it an “irresponsible act [that] endangered the satellites of other nations as well as the astronauts on the International Space Station.”
Meanwhile, the Trump and Biden administrations have ratcheted up efforts to counter competition from Russia and China in space. This was underscored by Trump’s decision to start a new branch of the military, the Space Force.
The new military branch is one of his few legacies that Biden has embraced, with the White House submitting a recent budget request of $24.5 billion for the Space Force, a bump of about 40% over the prior year. That’s almost as much as the $26 billion Biden requested for NASA, which predates Space Force by more than 60 years.
Those lingering tensions have complicated attempts to rewrite international rules on space debris, and the invasion of Ukraine has led U.S. officials to put on ice any direct talks between Washington and Moscow over space-related issues.
“We see no need for those discussions while they are in conflict with the Ukrainians,” Eric Desautels, acting deputy assistant secretary of State for emerging security challenges and defense policy, said in a recent interview hosted by the National Security Space Assn., a nonprofit that encourages cooperation between government and industry.
Desautels said that Russia and China would like a future treaty that constrains the U.S. from placing space-based missile defenses in orbit. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is defining defensive weapons versus those with offensive capabilities. The U.S. argues that commercial actors could be caught up in more restrictive rules, even if their work lacks a military intent.
Complicating potential negotiations are a raft of economic sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine war. The U.S. has taken intentional aim at the Russian space industry, with Biden vowing on the day of the invasion that U.S. sanctions were designed, in part, at degrading “their aerospace industry, including their space program.”
The economic crackdown against Russia has prompted a series of threats from its space officials. The head of Russia’s space program, Dmitry Rogozin, tweeted on April 2 in Russian that “the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions.”
Even before the Ukraine invasion, Moscow had indicated that it may leave the partnership in the next few years — citing safety concerns with aging metal — as it signs new agreements with China on space exploration and lunar research. The station, which has also become a rental hub for billionaire space tourists, is set to retire by 2030.
Zhanna Malekos Smith, a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Russia has created “strategic fog” with its mixed signals over the space station pact. But she pointed to signs of hope, including the March 30 return from the station of American astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who traveled back to Kazakhstan with two cosmonauts — Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov — in a Russian capsule.
When Shkaplerov handed control of the station to astronaut Thomas Marshburn a day earlier, he said that whatever problems existed on Earth — “in orbit, we are like one crew.”
West, the researcher with Project Ploughshares, said the invasion of Ukraine has accelerated and reframed many of the conversations around the militarization of space, including the interplay between civilian and government interests. Satellites, in particular, connect so much of the modern world while helping militaries coordinate troop movements and pinpoint missile strikes.
It’s a dramatic change in mindset compared with a ground war, where “you’re either in a war zone or you’re not,” she said.
She pointed out that other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, France, India, China, Russia and Japan, have moved toward creating more formalized space commands, like Space Force, a recognition that the battlefield has shifted.
They are all coming to the conclusion that space is not just for exploration. It’s also a new front line."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-11/even-greater-peril-to-civilians-seen-as-russia-readies-eastern-ukraine-onslaught;2022-04-12;Mariupol teeters as Russia readies eastern Ukraine onslaught - Los Angeles Times;"With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling compatriots to brace for a fateful week, Western military officials warned Monday that Russian forces would likely resort to even more brutal tactics against civilians in a looming offensive in the country’s south and east.
Nearly seven weeks into the war, Russian forces, whose campaign has been marked by strategic stumbles, appeared poised to achieve a major objective: capturing the port city of Mariupol. A Ukrainian marine brigade that described itself as among the last holdouts posted on Facebook that the unit had suffered a “mountain of wounded” and was running out of ammunition.
“For some, death, and for some, captivity,” said the post, which criticized Ukrainian military higher-ups for not providing more weaponry and resources for the fight.
Hours earlier, Zelensky said the city, the scene of one of the war’s most sustained and savage Russian offensives, had been “destroyed” and that tens of thousands of its residents were dead.
Later, Zelensky said in a virtual address to the Ukrainian people that he took seriously concerns that Russians could deploy chemical weapons in Mariupol. He urged Western leaders to impose a tougher package of sanctions, one that included an oil embargo against Russia.
“It is time,” he said, “to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side.”
Amid the carnage and rising atrocities in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin held his first face-to-face talks since the Feb. 24 invasion with a European leader, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. Nehammer was criticized in some quarters for handing the Kremlin a potential propaganda opportunity, but said afterward he had delivered a tough message to Putin that the war must end and Russian troops responsible for war crimes “would be held to account.”
In a news conference after his meeting with Putin, Nehammer said he was not optimistic. It was clear, he said, that Russian forces were preparing for a major offensive in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

“The battle being threatened cannot be underestimated in its violence,” he said.
Austria is a member of the 27-nation European Union, which has imposed stringent sanctions against Russia, but is militarily neutral and not a member of NATO — a status that in the past has allowed it to maintain closer links with Moscow. Nehammer, who met over the weekend with Zelensky, has demanded a war-crimes investigation against Russia, which denies its troops have committed atrocities against civilians.
European leaders, meanwhile, signaled that more sanctions against Moscow may be in the works. But the bloc is running out of ways to try to force Putin to break off the biggest ground war in Europe in decades, which has triggered the continent’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.
More than 4.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country, according to the latest United Nations figures, and about another 7 million are internally displaced. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes, the United Nations Children’s Fund said Monday.
“In my 31 years as a humanitarian, I have rarely seen so much damage caused in so little time,” Manuel Fontaine, director of UNICEF’s office of emergency programs, told the U.N. Security Council.
Sanctions “are always on the table,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told reporters as he headed into a meeting Monday with the bloc’s foreign ministers in Luxembourg.

World & Nation
Ukraine stiffens military defenses as President Volodymyr Zelensky framed the Russian invasion as an existential threat to all of European democracy.

The United States, for its part, was stepping up diplomatic efforts to bring more countries into the anti-Russia coalition. President Biden held a virtual meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is a U.S. ally, but has not imposed any sanctions against Russia. Among a four-nation group of allies known colloquially as the Quad — the U.S., Japan, Australia and India — Biden has previously described India as the only “somewhat shaky” country regarding Ukraine.
A senior Pentagon official said Monday that a long convoy of Russian military vehicles rolling toward the eastern city of Izyum with artillery, aviation and infantry support would reinforce and resupply their forces in the Donbas region. But the Russian effort to reinforce their capabilities, the official said, did not necessarily represent the beginning of a new Russian offensive in the region. Further south, the Russians were beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk with artillery units.
With a new phase of the war considered all but certain, Ukrainian civilians continued to try to escape from what is expected to become the next main battleground, the country’s eastern industrial heartland and its southern seacoasts.
Even with nearly another 3,000 people fleeing those areas on Sunday, according to Ukrainian officials, the pace of the exodus has been slowed by fear of more attacks like the one on a railway station last week in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, which killed at least 57 people, including five children.
After the rocket strike on the railway station, the evacuation of the Donetsk region will be carried out from the neighboring towns of Sloviansk and Povrovsk, said Oleksandr Honcharenko, the mayor of Kramatorsk. About 160,000 residents had already fled his city, he said, and about 45,000 remain, most of whom had endured the hostilities in 2014 and would probably remain if there is no heavy shelling.
Honcharenko emphasized that any resident who wanted to get out of the city could leave.
“The experience of other cities, such as Mariupol and Chernihiv, shows that the occupants are trying to use residents as hostages for their hostilities,” he said. “Therefore, the task of the city authorities, every mayor, is to keep the number of people, especially women and children, in the cities as small as possible.”
Zelensky’s account of death and destruction in Mariupol came in a video-link speech to South Korea’s parliament — the latest in a series of virtual addresses to lawmakers around the world to drum up support and plead for more weaponry for his beleaguered country.
Since the start of the war, Moscow’s forces have sought to capture Mariupol to establish a land corridor between Russian-controlled areas of the east and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized eight years ago.
On Monday, the head of the separatist rebel government in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces had suffered significant defeats in Mariupol.
“The port of Mariupol, it is already under our control,” Denis Pushilin, president of the Donetsk People’s Republic, told Russian state television, according to Russian news outlets. His claim could not immediately be verified.
Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said in an interview with the Associated Press that more than 10,000 civilians had died in his city and the death toll could exceed 20,000. Russian forces, he said, were attempting to conceal war crimes by bringing in mobile cremation equipment to dispose of the bodies.
“Mobile crematoriums have arrived in the form of trucks: You open it, and there is a pipe inside and these bodies are burned,” he said.
Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted in a report Sunday that Russian forces had made significant territorial gains in Mariupol, bisecting the besieged city from the city center to the coast and isolating the remaining Ukrainian troops in the Azovstal steel plant in the east and the main port of Mariupol in the southwest.
A British military intelligence assessment on Monday warned that Russia might resort to the use of phosphorus weapons in its bid to finally secure control of the city, and said civilians in many areas were imperiled by the invaders’ use of indiscriminate firepower.
“Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes, while greatly increasing the risk of further civilian casualties,” the assessment said.
Claims on social media and elsewhere that chemical weapons or an unknown substance had been deployed by Russian troops could not be independently verified and were not referenced by Zelensky in his speech Monday.
John F. Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said the U.S. was aware of the social media reports involving potential chemical munitions in Mariupol but could not confirm them. The U.S. would “continue to monitor the situation closely,” Kirby said.
Artillery strikes rocked several eastern cities early Monday. Air-raid sirens also wailed in the southern city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, where a massive blast reverberated late Sunday. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said in a video posted Monday that it was a missile strike that caused no deaths.
In his overnight video address, Zelensky said Russia was trying to evade responsibility for war crimes such as the reign of terror visited on areas outside Kyiv during a monthlong occupation before abandoning the bid to swiftly seize the capital city and topple the Ukrainian government.
Investigators and Ukrainian forces have been in satellite towns outside Kyiv, recovering bodies of civilians, many killed execution-style and thrown into mass graves. Forensic specialists from France arrived Monday to help with the preservation of evidence. Ukrainian officials say the count of fatalities in those outlying areas has surpassed 1,200.
“We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people, who tortured our people, destroyed our cities, looted and tormented,” Zelensky said.
He added that the coming week will be as “tense” as any in the course of the war, as Russian forces prepare to stage “even larger operations in the east of our state.”
In laying groundwork for that offensive, Russian missiles strikes destroyed the central city of Dnipro’s airport in a missile strike Sunday, Ukrainian officials acknowledged. But Ukrainian forces have also repulsed several assaults in eastern regions, “resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment,” the British military assessment said.
Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, said at a Monday briefing that Ukrainian troops had repulsed seven Russian attacks in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the last 24 hours.
“The enemy is finalizing the restoring of its units and redeploying them to the territory of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts,” Motuzyanyk said. “We predict that active combat operations will begin anytime soon. The Ukrainian army is ready for it.”
Russian forces also kept up unrelenting strikes near the seaport of Mariupol and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov, wrote on Facebook that eight people, including a 13-year-old child, died in bombardment on Monday and 19 people were injured.
“These are military crimes against peaceful Ukrainians who will never forgive Russians!” Sinegubov wrote.
Fears over the fate of Ukrainian civilians were heightened with word over the weekend that Russia has appointed a military chief known for atrocities in Syria to oversee the Kremlin’s war effort. The appointment of Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, Western officials say, suggests that the deliberate targeting of civilians, a hallmark of Russia’s war strategy, is likely to continue.
Adding to the sense of menace, the notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been leading fighters in Ukraine from his Russian republic, declared Monday that he was a loyal “foot soldier” to Putin and suggested that Ukrainian cities faced devastation if resistance to the Russian assault continues.
“Don’t let Kyiv be destroyed, Kharkiv and other cities,” Kadyrov, who has been sanctioned for human rights abuses, wrote in a Telegram post that also mentioned Mariupol, Luhansk and Donetsk.
Russia’s military setbacks since the start of the invasion have been plainly visible, but more details are emerging about the nature of its losses. The British Broadcasting Corp. reported more than 20% of the military personnel confirmed dead and identified by name were officers, including specialists like fighter pilots and veteran commanders.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-23/russia-ukraine-military-strategy;2022-04-23;Russia has advantages but faces challenges in the battle for Ukraine's east - Los Angeles Times;"When Russian troops blitzed into Ukraine, what was supposed to be an easy victory quickly foundered as Ukrainian forces mounted a strong defense that — along with Russia’s many missteps — have left Moscow mired in a withering two-month war with no end in sight.
Unable to take the capital, Kyiv, Russia’s war machine has since narrowed its ambitions, focusing on an intensifying battle to win the eastern Donbas region, where fighting has been waged since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its backing of Ukrainian separatists.

Rather than dense urban centers, Russian and Ukrainian forces are facing off across wide tracts of mostly flat, open farmland, interspersed with smaller towns and cities with a fraction of the population of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Such a scenario is reminiscent of the battlefields of World War II when tanks and artillery ravaged the plains of Europe.
And instead of rapier-thin thrusts to breach Ukraine’s borders, the Russian army and its separatist allies are now deployed along a contiguous front line shaped like a boomerang. That terrain begins north of Kharkiv to the city of Izyum, wrapping around the country’s eastern border and stretching along the southern coast to Kherson.
Experts say those two factors put Russia — plagued since the Feb. 24 invasion by supply, logistical, command and supply problems — in a more favorable position even as its troops have had little rest and Ukrainian forces continue to receive weapons and military technology from the U.S. and its NATO allies.
“When this war started, the Russians decided to invade from too many axes of advances, diluting the military’s capability,” said Rob Lee, a former U.S. Marine officer who is a Russia military specialist at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.

The shifting battlefield, said Lee, has changed that. Russia has a numerical advantage over the Ukrainian army when it comes to artillery, tanks and heavy units, especially when fighting in the open rather than in cities, where armor is less effective and big armies must often contend with swift-moving guerrilla offensives.
The Russians are also benefiting from maneuvering on territory controlled by Moscow-backed separatists who claimed roughly a third of the Donbas region before the wider war began. Russia won’t have to deal with the supply-line setbacks it faced in the initial phase of the invasion, when it had amassed as many as 190,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders, said John Arterbury, a European security expert at Navanti, based in Arlington, Va.
“They can equip directly from the separatist and border areas, and wouldn’t have to route them through Belarus and other areas,” he said. “They have a shorter head-to-tail logistic supply line, which would presumably allow them more cohesive advances.”
Despite assertions that the major offensive in the east has already begun, there so far have been no big tank battles. But multiple visits to different parts of the front lines, where dozens of towns have been battered and graves freshly dug, indicate the foundations for a large Russian advance against Ukrainian forces is almost in place.
Russian President Vladimir Putin — stung this month by the sinking of his nation’s flagship off the coast of Ukraine — is desperate for a military win ahead of the May 9 celebration of Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
In Severodonetsk, the easternmost tip of Ukrainian government control, one officer, who gave his name as Andrey, said that recent days had seen a sharp increase in Russia’s military presence — including 100 armored vehicles and special forces operatives — in Kreminna, 12 miles to the northwest and the first town to be captured by Russian forces since the new phase of the operation began.
Russia has also ramped up the use of artillery and drones, rather than launching the smaller incursions that proved its undoing on the outskirts of Kyiv, where its forces were bogged down for weeks and unable to penetrate the capital. Some analysts suggest that Russia has a Potemkin army — one that looks good, trains well, but has failed on the battlefield.
“Before, they were trying to move fast,” said Andrey. “Now they’re going slowly and preparing fortifications, something more for a long war.”
The picture is different closer to Izyum. There, said Lt. Vladimir, who works with a special reconnaissance unit and asked to be identified by only one name, Moscow’s forces have swarmed small villages with large amounts of armor as they engage in a sort of thunder run to attack the city of Lyman from two sides.
That puts them about 12 miles northeast of Slovyansk, which, along with neighboring Kramatorsk, are seen as the linchpins needed for Russia to link up with forces coming from the south, including from the besieged port city of Mariupol, in a strategy to encircle the Ukrainian army.
The lieutenant said the Russians appeared to have learned from past mistakes.
“When we try to target them with artillery with coordinates from our drones, they move very quickly into the forests and hide,” he said.
Ukraine, meanwhile, has fortified its defenses in the area, building on the already large troop presence set up in the Donbas over the nearly eight years of war with the separatists.
In recent days, convoys of heavy materiel, including howitzers, tanks, multiple-rocket launcher trucks and other armored vehicles — many of them camouflaged with branches of trees to blend in with the forests — have appeared on the streets of Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Lyman.
Authorities have employed similar tactics to those they used in the run-up to the assault on Kyiv: blowing up bridges, introducing chokepoints on highways with antitank Czech hedgehogs and obscuring road signs to confuse the Russian invaders. One such sign outside Slovyansk had profanities spray-painted over each city name.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have dug trenches in the fields by major highways, with the aim of denying Russian armor the ability to move off-road, even as the intense rains of the Ukrainian spring have turned fields into muddy pits that slow heavy vehicles.
The coming battle will put additional pressure on a Russian army, which includes mercenaries from Syria and Libya, still reeling from its losses in the first round of the invasion. Recent estimates put the losses at somewhere above 13,000 dead, double that figure of wounded, with an additional 7,000 missing.
“The force they’ve cobbled together, it’s dramatically diminished compared to what they started the war with,” said Michael Kofman, the Russian studies director at the CNA think tank in Arlington, Va.
Although the task set before them is different from the diffuse, multi-front assault they planned in the beginning, “it still doesn’t mean that all the Russian forces are well positioned to take on the fairly sizable number of Ukrainian units defending the Donbas,” he added.
And the attrition among Russian units will only increase as the offensive drags on, Arterbury said: “They’re pulling units from everywhere, and you can’t keep every unit on the front line, and ultimately the question is how long can they put up with it.”
The situation regarding Ukrainian losses is more opaque. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said between 2,500 and 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and roughly 10,000 wounded. Western intelligence agencies estimate the casualties are more than twice those numbers.
Yet the bigger issue is equipment losses, with Ukraine unable to replace tanks and heavy weaponry at the rate that Russia can, Arterbury said.
“Ukraine can still trade space for time,” Lee said. “No country wants to give up land, but ultimately, if they pull back if it’s too difficult, they can still do that, and still try to maintain a more defensible position.”
Whatever the outcome, Kofman said, Russia’s army will be ill-equipped to continue fighting for more territory.
“The reality is that whatever happens in the next fighting, the Russian military is likely to be exhausted afterward,” he said. “The likelihood of them going beyond the Donbas is quite low.”"

Ultimatum ignored in Mariupol as attacks intensify in east Ukraine
Russia tightened its grip around Ukraine’s last stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol, whose desperate defenders, holed up in underground shelters beneath a massive steel plant, pleaded for international help, declaring that they were “probably facing our last days, if not hours.”
Along hundreds of miles of a scythe-shaped battlefront in Ukraine’s east, the din of Russian bombardment echoed in cities and towns, while Moscow’s ground forces made a series of what Ukrainian military officials described as probing attacks that did not yield any substantial new territorial gains.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the nation that nearly all of Russia’s combat-ready forces were “concentrated on the territory of our state” and just outside its borders. Moscow, he said, was deploying “almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting.”

Inflation brings California food banks a surge in first-time users on ‘razor’s edge’

Food banks across the state are seeing an influx of new faces as spikes in the cost of groceries and gas have some Californians seeking help for the first time. The numbers of those receiving services dipped at the start of the year as the spread of the COVID-19 virus waned, but are now rising in the face of the highest inflation in 41 years.
The issue is twofold, as food bank administrators are grappling with their own higher costs for food and the gas it takes to transport it to local pantries. The California Assn. of Food Banks is calling for nearly twice as much money from the state than Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed in his January budget for the regional organizations, warning that relief from the government that had buoyed low-income families during the pandemic is expiring and will further contribute to financial woes.
L.A. says it can’t take care of its sickest and most vulnerable. The county isn’t buying it
This month, Los Angeles officials announced a partial settlement of a 2-year-old federal lawsuit over homelessness. The city pledged to create housing, either permanent or interim, for 60% of the city’s unsheltered homeless population. Lawyers representing L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, the group that filed the lawsuit, endorsed the agreement.
Conspicuously absent from the event were representatives of Los Angeles County, which is also being sued by the group. They bashed the settlement, saying the city was in effect seeking to dump responsibility for thousands of severely ill homeless people onto the county.
The dispute has exposed a growing wedge between the city and county that threatens to undo years of cooperation between the massive bureaucracies at a time when homelessness continues to spiral out of control.

How long COVID upended the life of an L.A. teen
Week after week, 13-year-old Ami Korn holed up in his Tarzana bedroom with his dog, Barley, to quarantine after testing positive for the coronavirus. Korn ended up missing much of eighth grade as he continued to endure long COVID, a phenomenon in which symptoms persist for weeks or months after a coronavirus infection.
More than a year later, he has regained his physical strength and is back to playing baseball. He and his parents credit his work in cardiopulmonary rehab, along with acupuncture, medication, vitamins and other therapies.
But at school, he is still grappling with brain fog and struggling with his faltering memory. He once prided himself on his recall but now comes up empty when asked about things that came up in class just days before.

The Supreme Court sounds ready to shield police from lawsuits for Miranda warning violations. The justices heard arguments in a case — arising from a 2014 confrontation between a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy and a hospital nursing assistant — that seeks to answer for the first time whether officers who don’t provide a Miranda warning can be sued for violating a suspect’s constitutional rights.
A ‘wall of fire’ forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes near Flagstaff, Ariz. Officials declared an emergency after the wildfire ballooned from 100 acres to over nine square miles by evening, and ash rained from the sky outside a northern Arizona tourist town. Coconino County officials said 766 homes and 1,000 animals had been evacuated.
Can Texas declare a border ‘invasion’ and return migrants to Mexico? Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is facing mounting pressure from far-right and former Trump administration officials to immediately declare a migrant “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border, under a constitutional provision that would allow local law enforcement and National Guard troops to stop migrants at the border and send them back to Mexico.
USC suggested that student filmmakers went rogue in a production that ended in the death of a Chapman cinematographer. School officials said students from its prestigious film school appeared to have flouted university safety policies and procedures in carrying out the Imperial County film shoot in which a young cinematographer from Chapman University died.
New Mexico handed the ‘Rust’ production its maximum fine for safety violations. A state agency issued the movie production a fine of $136,793 for violations that led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in October. The agency concluded that the management of the production knew that firearm safety procedures were not being followed on set.
With a pair of reissues and a tour, Pavement is back. Stephen Malkmus promises he’s excited. The band will rerelease its first and final albums, two records that bookended one of the greatest and most influential indie rock catalogs of the 1990s. Malkmus spoke to The Times about the band’s music, TikTok and what he has in common with Kanye West.
Netflix’s ‘Russian Doll’ didn’t need a second season, but the series has pulled it off beautifully. Stylistically and philosophically consistent with its predecessor, it’s different enough not to feel like a calculating retread. As before, it’s admirable in its ingenuity, a little radical and deeply felt in ways that are not radical at all, writes television critic Robert Lloyd.

Mortgage rates are rising. Will that slow our out-of-control housing market? Several top real estate experts said they didn’t foresee price declines — at least meaningful ones — absent a recession. Several factors should largely uphold home values: a severe shortage of homes for sale, rising incomes, falling unemployment and — in plain language — a tendency for homeowners to be greedy.
Elon Musk says he’s a ‘free speech absolutist,’ but he has a long history of opposing speech and transparency. Musk might be serious about taking over Twitter. But he’s been sued for defamation, has defended himself by saying no one takes him literally and was fined by the government for making fraudulent business claims — he’s what you’d call an unreliable narrator.
The future of weed isn’t in California. It’s somewhere totally unexpected. Oklahoma is a politically conservative, medical-marijuana-only state in the South that’s a beacon of hope, a cautionary tale and a strategic long game all at once.

Hockey is making inroads in Mexico. Yes, Mexico. According to the Mexico Ice Hockey Federation 2,690 players participate in the sport in Mexico, 1,600 of whom are junior players. It’s a small number, but it still has drawn the attention of several NHL teams, which see a chance to grow the game and develop a new fan base.
Oscar De La Hoya is accused of sexual assault. A tequila company executive filed a civil suit in L.A. County Superior Court accusing the former boxing great of two instances of sexual assault. The woman alleges that during a trip to Mexico in March 2020 to visit the Casa Mexico Tequila distillery, De La Hoya banged on her hotel room door “with his pants dropped down to his ankles, then pushed his way into the room, and got into her bed,” according to the lawsuit.
So long, Johnny Juzang. The UCLA shooting guard’s departure for the NBA draft, which he announced in an Instagram post, clears the way for the Bruins’ next highly coveted wing player, Amari Bailey, to feature more prominently in the team’s plans for next season. That’s not to say Juzang won’t be missed.

The latest scare tactic to rile the GOP base? The word ‘groomer.’ Mangling the meaning of the word may help score a few political points for conservatives who are in a panic about gay and trans rights. But it slanders people who actually care about the healthy sexual development of children and trivializes the very real phenomenon of child sexual abuse, writes columnist Robin Abcarian.
Food fight! A tussle over olive oil has sparked a debate: Who can use California’s name? The McEvoy family, along with other Northern California olive oil artisans, believe their regional brand is sacred — much like Italians with their Parmigiano-Reggiano or the French with their Champagne. But in this case, the brand is California extra virgin olive oil, a product connoisseurs seek out for its pungency and pepperiness.
A new state law punishes those who improperly use the California name to peddle oil from elsewhere. The movement that led to the new law triggered one of the biggest food fights in California since Napa vintners got the state to ban charlatans from marketing their wines with the region’s name. It has implications extending far beyond the scenic olive groves of Northern California, drawing into the debate food safety advocates, global marketing consultants, even hedge fund players who see potential for big profits in products labeled as Californian.
Eighty-eight years ago today, the Daily Mail printed a photo that was said to depict the Loch Ness monster. A few days later — after the pic was “rushed from London to New York by radiograph and then sent air mail to Los Angeles” — The Times published it with a breathless, boxed caption. (To be fair, we did pair the coverage with a story on a 1904 hoax involving a hippogriff.)
The image became known as the “surgeon’s photograph.” A 1987 story in The Times on the continuing search for the legendary beast said that in 1934 “a London surgeon, Dr. Robert K. Wilson, snapped the first and most famous of several photographs purporting to show the Loch Ness monster. Ever since, Wilson’s picture, depicting what seemed to be a small, dark head on an elongated neck, has been the accepted vision of Nessie.”

A son found lying with his hands folded beneath his cheek, as if sleeping. People run over by Russian armored vehicles, their mangled remains pulled from a mass grave. A woman’s corpse covered only by a thin nightgown that offered no scrim of dignity.
In the brutal landscape of what were once placid and prosperous suburbs and satellite towns near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, investigators struggle daily to document evidence of mass atrocities against the people who once lived here.
Because the dead, in their way, can speak.
They work painstakingly, these caretakers and curators, these examiners and searchers who are affording the most meticulous care to this scatter of carnage, for the sake of the knowledge to bring the perpetrators to justice — perhaps.
And painstakingly, also, in the sense that they — along with the stunned mourners they minister to, as best they can — are absorbing the horror of what transpired here, along roadsides, in cellars, and in the mud of gardens and backyards.
The Russians have been gone for nearly as long as they occupied  these small Ukrainian communities, living among those whose lives they would take or change forever. Over the weeks, it became clearer that the Russian military advance would stall here, that the invaders’ imagined swift and triumphal push into the capital would be derailed in a tangle of logistical and other problems.
World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.


For that ignominious failure, and the backlash it ignited, civilians paid the price. Hundreds died here, Ukrainian officials say, and an outraged world is demanding war crimes investigations and eventual accountability.
That’s for later. For now, a sorrowful procession arrives daily at the morgue in Bucha, a town whose name has become a byword for hideous suffering coming to light weeks after the fact. The crowd is small and desolate, waiting for the bodies of loved ones to be formally identified and released as the exactitude of forensic science folds into simple grief.
Out front, a dozen gurneys bore numbered plastic body bags. Some of the remains had been exhumed days before from the mass grave at the church of St. George, a few blocks away. More than 50 bodies were recovered there.
Now, the ragged trench has been filled in with dirt. A bloodied comforter still lay on the ground.
At the morgue, Zena Laboonska leaned over the body bag holding her 31-year-old son, Sergey Sydorchuk, bearing a tag with the number 184. With both hands, she touched the white plastic covering.
Nearby, a man named Sergey Bauepa was waiting to collect the remains of his son Nicolai, dead at 37. Even after an interval of weeks, the father had the air of a person trying to process something beyond his capacity to wonder.
“They killed him,” he said.
Up the road in the heavily damaged town of Borodyanka, black-clad Ukrainian police investigators went about their bleak task: taking pictures and measurements of a dug-up grave containing six  bodies.
Alexander Salov, 39, already knew the fate of his 64-year-old father, Sergey: body mainly intact, head crushed. He had stood in front of a Russian armored vehicle, trying to stop it, witnesses said. It ran him over.
Another of the six bodies in the grave also had been run over by heavy vehicles, while four other corpses, at least one of them a woman, bore the marks of gunshot wounds.

Photojournalist Carolyn Cole documents Ukrainian life amid Russia’s invasion.

A few yards away, police tape marked off an area where three other bodies, two male and one female, were uncovered by police investigators. Nadya Boyko had buried her son there after he was shot and killed by Russian troops on Feb. 28.
Now, after the investigators finished their work, she would return him to the earth a second time.
The body of a woman exhumed was covered only by a thin nightgown, suggestive of other horrors. Along with cataloging the many signs of execution-style killings, war-crimes investigators are documenting evidence of sexual atrocities committed by the occupying forces.
Near the town of Andriivka, about 50 miles north of Kyiv, Nadya Savran knew something was wrong when her son Igor, a car mechanic, didn’t come home on March 19. The Russians had occupied their village since Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began.
She feared the worst. But even after the Russians retreated on March 30, the 66-year-old mother was told it was too dangerous to look for him. The area was laced with mines.
Finally, as if in an eerie game of hide-and-seek, townspeople inspected two underground bunkers the Russians had created by burying a car and truck. Nearby, in a white building with wooden doors, she found her 46-year-old son’s body lying on his side, shot twice in the chest.
Recounting the moment, she mimed a posture of sleep — slumber, as  that of a child.
Now there are a dozen freshly dug graves in the town’s  graveyard, newly cleared of mines. Igor and his boyhood friend Vladimir Pozharnikov, who went missing at the same time, are buried side by side.
Atop their graves are yellow flowers and pieces of candy. A butter cookie.
Savran and her son had talked about the Russian presence, but didn’t fully grasp how war so quickly encroaches. When he was out of the house, she didn’t hide in the basement; she stayed in the living room, with her cat for company.
She remembers something he said to her during those days, as if the very idea that someone would attack him for no reason was unfathomable.
“Why,” he asked, “should I have to die?”
No answer came. Perhaps one never would.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-29/russia-ukraine-invasion-military-history-russo-japanese-war;2022-04-29;Op-Ed: Russia didn't learn from the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. But Ukraine can - Los Angeles Times;"On television and online, commentators reach furiously for comparisons to past conflicts for insights into the Ukrainian-Russian war. How will it ever end?
At the same time, military analysts watch closely to see how lethal new technologies lead to ghastly carnage like in Donbas and Irpin. What can we learn about how to fight future wars?
Surprising answers arise from comparisons to an often-overlooked conflict more than a century ago, between a small nation just elbowing its way onto the world stage and a huge but faltering Western power that just happened to be Russia.
Opinion
It may sound like a neat way to avoid ‘boots on the ground’ for Americans, but the bloodshed would be immense.

The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 was a big deal at the time, and it is generally considered the first modern war. The world watched with rapt attention. In the story of this conflict, we can find clues to what is happening, and what may still happen, in Vladimir Putin’s misbegotten and bloody invasion of  Ukraine.
Repeating rifles, machine guns and fast-firing artillery were as new in 1904 as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Turkish drones are today. They all played roles, as did swiftly maneuvering steel warships. The Japanese navy’s destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet, which had sailed halfway around the planet, shocked the world in 1905 as much as Ukrainian missiles’ sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva did this month.
But it shouldn’t have. And nor would the struggles of the Russian military today surprise anyone who studied the Russo-Japanese War. Rivers of similarities run through these two conflicts.
Naturally, there were differences, the biggest being that Japan, angered by diplomatic betrayals and Russian expansion in Asia, started the war. It began with a surprise nighttime torpedo boat attack against the Russian fleet in Port Arthur (now the Lüshunkou District of China).
Opinion
KGB agents are apparently not taught history, or so it would seem from Vladimir Putin’s recent statement that only “God knows” how a portion of southeastern Ukraine ever became part of that country.

Japan’s navy was modern, its traditions based on Britain’s Royal Navy; Japanese sailors even ate curry on Fridays like their English counterparts. (They still do.) Its warships were state-of-the-art and built in England. Thus, a major Western power supplied modern technologies to the smaller of the warring nations, like in the current conflict.

The Japanese soldiers and sailors, swept up in their nation’s extraordinary shift to modernity, were motivated to fight. They were also trained and fed well. And they saw Russia as a greedy, overreaching bully.
Russian soldiers, meanwhile, quickly found themselves under siege in the barren winter hellscape of Port Arthur, thousands of miles from Russia’s major urban centers — and with no real rationale in their heads as to why they were fighting. Supply lines, already extraordinarily long, were easily cut. Russian soldiers’ equipment, training and basic supplies were lacking.
Sound familiar?
Opinion
War is on everybody’s mind in Germany. But not always the immediate war in Ukraine — sometimes it’s the wars of the past we promised never to have again.

The world was sure Russia would win. It had a vaunted military in the grand European tradition. How could little upstart Japan possibly emerge victorious?
Like the conflict in Ukraine that has been livestreamed to and from smartphones, the Russo-Japanese war was witnessed globally almost in real time. Telegraph wires and steam-powered newspaper presses sent new editions onto the streets hourly to feed a hungry public.
The Japanese bottled up the Russian Pacific squadron at Port Arthur, and so Russian Emperor Nicholas II — ever confident of victory, despite setback after setback — shifted tactics and sent his huge Baltic Fleet on an around-the-world voyage to teach the upstart Japanese a lesson.

Opinion
It’s hard to find a sane analyst who argues that Putin invaded Ukraine solely in the name of Russia’s rational self-interest rather than his own notions of glory and historical retribution.

Around Africa they went, beset by logistical and maintenance problems. The ships were out of date and badly maintained, the crews’ training minimal. So incompetent were the captains that, while off the coast of England, they opened fire on British fishing boats, believing them to be Japanese attackers. Reparations were paid. Reminds one of the seemingly ungoverned Russian forces bumbling around Ukraine.
Finally, after seven months, the Russian fleet arrived in the Far East. Alerted by telegraph from the island of Tsushima, the Japanese admiral, Heihachirō Tōgō, set sail with his fresh, eager fleet to meet the exhausted Russians. In a matter of hours, practically all the Russian battleships were at the bottom of the sea.
Tōgō and his command staff conducted the battle from the open-air bridge atop his flagship, the Mikasa. The Russian admiral, by comparison, remained hunkered within the enclosed steel wheelhouse of his ship. Tōgō thus had a 360-degree view of everything that was happening, and perhaps more importantly, his crews could see him — in the open, watching it all through binoculars as shells whizzed past.
Not unlike Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s stubbornly visible leadership today.
The two countries soon had a negotiated peace. Japan had become a world power.

Opinion
Ukraine’s resistance to Putin’s invasion continues a multigenerational drive for self-determination against Russian supremacists.

The legacy of that war was long-lasting, and not necessarily positive. It presaged the horror of World War I battlefields. Anger over the defeat was one reason the Russian people eventually rose up against Nicholas II in revolution. In Japan, overconfidence from this conflict led military leaders to believe that Western powers were hollowed out, with no will to fight, and could be beaten with surprise, brains and guts. This brought us to Pearl Harbor.
The world’s savvy militaries took to heart lessons about trench building, frontal attacks and the power of a well-maintained, well-trained and well-drilled squadron of battleships armed with turreted heavy guns and smokeless powder — just as today’s onlookers are wrestling with the deadly lessons of those Javelins, drones and Neptune anti-ship missiles.
There is still pride in Japan over the victory at Tsushima. The Mikasa is now a museum in Yokosuka near Tokyo. You can visit Tōgō’s cabin and admire his bathtub. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to admire Zelensky’s bathtub in Kyiv.

But that was just pretend. War had come swift and brutal to this palace. There were no children racing upstairs to dance lessons. No performers dabbing on makeup. No seamstresses putting the final touches on a costume. There was only the crack of broken glass underfoot and the roar of artillery, shattering any illusions of art or culture.

It has been slightly more than a month since Russian troops advanced on Rubizhne, a small, well-appointed city nestled in a verdant slice of land by the Seversky Donets River. With the intense rains of the Ukrainian spring above them, they shelled the town for days, sending a lethal deluge of ordnance that obliterated everything in its path,  as most of the city’s 55,000 people fled while they still could.
It wasn’t the first time conflict visited Rubizhne. In World War II, the Nazis occupied it, making it the site of a prison until the Red Army liberated it in 1943. In 2014, fighting engulfed the city once more, this time with the Moscow-backed separatists, who took over for three months before they were expelled by government forces.

But now it was a new war, a push by Russians to seize a wide swath of eastern Ukraine. Enemy soldiers entered the city proper, waging grinding street battles against Ukrainian defenders. The destruction was ubiquitous.  On a drive through the southern part of the city, there seemed a repetitive sameness to it: almost every structure a gutted, blackened husk of rubble, splintered wood and broken glass.
The palace, though scarred, was one of the few still standing, a refuge, a sentinel in a town that, like many others, had hoped cruelty would not visit and fresh graves would not be dug.

Roughly a dozen people were sheltering here, including 19-year-old Evgenia, a culinary school student. A month ago, fighting near the city’s train station destroyed the house she was in, forcing her to move to her grandmother’s home. That too was destroyed, so she, along with her parents and one grandmother, came here. The other grandmother was stuck in Kreminna, a neighboring city, which had fallen to the Russians  this week.
Rubizhne has become a landscape of smashed, scorched buildings and cratered boulevards.
“I can’t leave my grandmothers now,” she said,  explaining why she didn’t evacuate herself.
Down in the basement were others, most of them pensioners too poor or too old to countenance the idea of going anywhere. “My daughter is now in Germany. My mother is here, and she can’t travel. I have nobody to help,” said Luda, a 60-year-old pensioner and former teacher. She came here in the first days of the Russian attack, when a shell whistled through her roof and water fell into her living room.
She stood in almost complete darkness, save for the flickering light of an almost-spent candle. Others around her were lying down, swathed in blankets. It was spring, but some nights it felt like winter. One man, a cantankerous 65-year-old miner named Misha, was eating a can of what appeared to be minced meat.
No electricity or gas meant they used candles for light and wood for heating water, which was trucked in by aid workers.
“We lost signal on our phone a while ago. We get our news via FM radio. Ukrainian,” Luda said.
The news wasn’t good. It seldom was these days.
So much of the palace seemed like a snapshot of what was now a distant past: a  bandoneon abandoned in a debris-filled room, along with some music drawn up on a stave for a lesson now never to be learned; costumes arrayed in the dressing room; and in the theater a wooden cutout of a cartoonish-looking cow for some children’s play that would never have another performance.

Would the palace survive? Would it come back? If it did, would it be the same? It didn’t seem likely. Underground, the people shut the basement door, sitting in the darkness, listening to sounds distant and close.
Later that day, the Russian army declared it had taken over Rubizhne."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-22/french-election-macron-le-pen-pivotal-moment-ukraine;2022-04-22;French presidential race comes at pivotal moment for Europe - Los Angeles Times;"Days before a consequential French election, at a fraught moment of the war on Europe’s eastern edge, President Emmanuel Macron had a telling debate exchange with challenger Marine Le Pen, who embodies the far right’s best chance yet to seize power in one of the continent’s most important and influential nations.
“I am not like you,” declared Le Pen, 53, a longtime politician who has worked hard to soften her extreme anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-European Union image since the two last went head to head at the polls five years ago.
“You are not like me — thank you for the reminder,” retorted Macron, 44, an EU-embracing, cosmopolitan centrist who became France’s youngest elected president when he trounced Le Pen in the 2017 contest.
Polls suggest that Macron will again prevail in Sunday’s runoff vote against the nationalist-populist Le Pen, but by what could be a considerably closer margin than the last time around.
Opinion
Looking at the French presidential election makes me grateful for our two-party system and constitutional safeguards.


This contest, analysts say, is driven by a divisive political dynamic: Backers of both Macron and Le Pen view the opposing camp’s candidate not merely as unappealing but as an active threat to the country and its way of life.
Even after the election is over, the deep fissures laid bare by the campaign will continue to reverberate outside France’s borders.
The country is the European Union’s second-biggest economy and the bloc’s most powerful state alongside Germany. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, it is the only EU country with veto power in the world body. And the war in Ukraine vastly raises the stakes for European unity.

Although Le Pen has condemned Russia’s invasion of its neighbor, she opposes sanctions on Russian gas and oil, a direction in which the EU is moving. She has backed off from her previous advocacy for quitting NATO but says she would withdraw France from the alliance’s integrated command structure, has been friendly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and argues for a “strategic rapprochement” between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
In a sign of their concern over what might happen in Sunday’s runoff, the leaders of Germany, Spain and Portugal published a column Thursday in several European papers urging French voters to back Macron. The commentary did not mention either candidate by name but referred to oneas a “democratic” politician who supports a “powerful and autonomous European Union” and the other as an “extreme-right candidate who openly sides with those who attack our freedom and democracy.”
Analysts say that simply by being a more viable candidate in Sunday’s rematch than she was five years ago, Le Pen has already achieved a significant victory. She and Macron were the two top vote-getters in the April 10 first-round vote, separated by fewer than 5 percentage points.
World & Nation
With war singeing the European Union’s eastern edge, French voters will make a choice in a presidential election that will have an effect beyond the country’s borders.

“Never, in the modern history of France, never has a candidate from the extreme right gotten so close to power,” said Vincent Martigny, a professor of political science at the University of Nice.
Since the initial vote this month, Macron has widened his lead, polling up to 12 percentage points ahead in some surveys. Nonetheless, Le Pen’s first-round performance was seen as a wake-up call for the French political establishment.
Macron swept into office in 2017 promising a new kind of politics, appealing to voters on both sides of the political spectrum. But in some quarters, disillusionment has set in.
Once ensconced in the Elysee Palace, he veered to the right, alienating supporters on the left, and failed to deliver the environmental program that activists had hoped for. Many of those struggling economically say Macron is out of touch, and a common gibe labels him the “president of the rich.”

The president got a brief bump in the polls over his statesmanlike role before and after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, but as the war has dragged on for two months, initial enthusiasm for his diplomacy on the world stage has subsided.
On the campaign trail, Le Pen has played down earlier demands to end immigration, leave the European Union and ban the Muslim head scarf in public places. Instead, she has stressed pocketbook issues that resonate well with not only her voter base but also Macron’s.
Conversely, Macron has moved to the right on some issues to try to steal some of Le Pen’s thunder and keep abreast of a general rightward shift by the French electorate. He has toughened his stance on immigration and appointed a hard-line interior minister to burnish his law-and-order credentials.
In Wednesday evening’s debate, Le Pen delivered a more polished performance than her crash-and-burn stage presence during the 2017 debate but made clear that her core beliefs had not changed.
“We are facing barbarism,” she said. “We must deal with the problem of massive, unregulated immigration, which is aggravating insecurity in our country.” Le Pen also called Muslim head coverings for women “a uniform imposed by Islamists.”
Seemingly aware of his image as aloof and arrogant, Macron used the debate to try to convince voters that he empathized with them, understood their difficulties — and was the only candidate with realistic solutions. He pledged help for students and higher wages for teachers, and promised to improve working conditions for healthcare workers.
World & Nation
France is allowing healthcare workers who are infected with the coronavirus but have few or no symptoms to keep treating patients rather than isolate.


But his body language — arms crossed as he listened, an expression on his face some saw as patronizing — undercut efforts to identify with everyman voters. So did some of his rhetoric. When Le Pen tried to talk about the national debt, which swelled because of Macron’s pandemic bailout package, he scolded her: “Stop mixing things up.”
With the war in Ukraine, Le Pen’s longtime friendly stance toward Putin has become a point of political vulnerability. In the debate, Macron jabbed at her over a loan to her party for her previous presidential campaign that was contracted through a Russian bank.
“You’re talking about your banker when you talk about Russia,” he said. “You depend on Russian power. You depend on Mr. Putin.”
Over the last decade, Le Pen has tried to rehabilitate her image and that of her movement, an effort critics and backers alike describe as “de-demonization.” In 2011, she rebranded her party as the National Rally, changing its name from the National Front, which under her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was long associated with antisemitism and attacks on immigrants.
World & Nation
In France, an upsurge of physical and verbal attacks directed at public officials — often over COVID-19 policies — are ringing alarm bells.

While emphasizing a sympathy for the common man, she has tried to cultivate an almost maternal demeanor that, to some, eclipsed hard-line elements of her platform.
“Her image isn’t excellent, but it’s better than five years ago, and maybe ever,” said Emilien Houard-Vial, who teaches political science at Paris’ Sciences Po university.
At a recent rally, Le Pen took a supporter’s 6-year-old daughter onstage and agreed to the child’s plea that the candidate take her to Disneyland if she is elected president. “This promise, be sure, I will also keep,” Le Pen’s official Twitter account said afterward.
Political theater aside, many voters say they will go to the polls with the aim of defeating one of the candidates, rather than in a genuine expression of support for the other.
World & Nation
A wave of killings of women by their current or former partners has rattled France, where critics blame a deeply entrenched sexism.

Jean Galen, a property developer in southwestern France, plans to vote for Le Pen. He said he now sees Macron, whom he backed in 2017, as domineering and authoritarian-minded.
“I suspect that many will vote for Macron out of fear of Le Pen,” he said. “I am going to vote for Le Pen out of fear of Macron.”
For him, as for a chunk of the electorate, the COVID-19 pandemic is a wedge issue.
In January, Macron used a pungent epithet to describe his desire to isolate and inconvenience those who refuse to be vaccinated. Although some compatriots cheered that remark, Galen was emphatically not among them.
Coralie Renardier, a 27-year-old guest-relations specialist in Paris, doesn’t think Macron lived up to his promises but plans to vote for him anyway.
“It will be too dangerous,” she said, “to have the extreme right.”

Russia intensifies its assault with fresh strikes on eastern Ukraine
Determined to seize control of Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Russia intensified its assaults across the country’s east while keeping up the bombardment of Ukrainian forces in the besieged southern port of Mariupol.
Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that in 24 hours, Russian forces had launched strikes against more than 1,200 Ukrainian military facilities and targeted more than 1,200 troop concentrations, details that could not be independently verified.
Ukraine says Russia has begun its long-expected all-out assault on the east — and Moscow’s top diplomat confirmed that the struggle has entered its next stage. Western military officials and analysts warned that the current Russian attacks may be setting the battlefield for a larger and potentially far more brutal offensive planned by Moscow.

The new mask-optional phase of the pandemic fuels fears and some cheers
A new mask-optional phase of the pandemic is arriving, sparking concern from some experts that the shift is occurring too soon. For months, local officials have been easing mask rules in public places such as supermarkets and shopping malls. But a federal court ruling striking down the federal mask-wearing order on public transportation systems accelerated the trend.
Parents of young children who cannot get vaccinated and  advocates for people with compromised immune systems are alarmed. It’s unclear, for now, whether the lifting of the mask order at this time on public transit will dramatically worsen the pandemic. But making masks optional too soon on transit could create more vulnerabilities if another variant comes along.

They called for defunding the LAPD. Now they’re looking to defeat City Council members
Labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martinez, college administrator Dulce Vasquez and community activist Eunisses Hernandez are running for Los Angeles City Council in the June 7 election, looking to unseat a trio of incumbents who have served on the body for nearly a decade.
Hernandez is running against Councilman Gil Cedillo on the Eastside. Vasquez is challenging Councilman Curren Price in South Los Angeles. Soto-Martinez is looking to unseat Councilman Mitch O’Farrell in Hollywood.
All three challengers are mounting credible campaigns, hoping to replicate the 2020 success of Nithya Raman, who became the first council candidate to unseat an incumbent in 17 years. Two years after the city erupted in protest over police killings, those candidates — and several others — will test the public’s appetite for reining in law enforcement spending.

Netflix loses 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter
After experiencing unprecedented growth during the pandemic, Netflix is now losing subscribers. The global streaming giant said  it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter, missing its own projections of adding 2.5 million  and marking the first decline in a decade.
The company estimated it would lose 2 million global subscribers in the current quarter. Although Netflix remains the dominant player in streaming with 222 million subscribers globally, it faces rising competition and an inevitable slowdown after a surge in business during the pandemic. Investors were rattled by the results. After Netflix released its earnings, the shares plunged 23% to $267.68 in after-hours trading.
She lost one son to violence. Now she’s fighting to keep her other two alive
Latasha Bracks’ eldest son, Tashon Logan, was shot to death at age 19 on March 31, 2019. She is not the first mother to bear the weight of raising children in a tough neighborhood with more gangs and guns than opportunity. But hers is an uncommon common story, one of atonement and second chances.
Bracks is a 47-year-old single mother and recovering addict who lived for two years in a rescue mission and a string of flophouses before finding a stable home to raise her family. She lost one son and almost lost another.
And as she works through the grief and pain of Logan’s slaying, she is newly focused. On bettering herself and her community. On her two remaining sons. On the job of keeping them alive.

A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge sentenced Aariel Maynor, the man convicted in the murder of well-known philanthropist Avant to more than 150 years to life in prison, saying he shot a “highly vulnerable” 81-year-old woman in the back and then giggled about it afterward.
Grieving cyclists call for a safer Griffith Park after a 77-year-old is killed. Griffith Park, which occupies more than 4,000 acres of rolling hills, is popular with cyclists who whiz down its tree-lined roads, often crossing over from the nearby L.A. River bike path. But the few bike lanes that exist do not have barriers separating riders from cars.

Looking back at the absolutely unexpected and totally wild origin of 420. What do the Point Reyes lighthouse, French chemist Louis Pasteur and the Grateful Dead all have in common? Well, they’re all part of the origin story of how 420 methodically worked its way from a secret code to mainstream weed lingo. The tale starts in 1971, with five San Rafael High School students who, in keeping with their goofy sense of humor, met up at 4:20 p.m. to smoke as much cannabis as they could find.
A secret no more, 420 has become a representation of cannabis culture — love it or hate it — and a day and time that is observed by cannabis enthusiasts around the world. It was even a recent “Jeopardy!” clue. This year, two of those friends — a group known as The Waldos — spoke to The Times to explain what it was like to see the term take on a life of its own and their views on the future of weed.
Seventy-three years ago today, on April 20, 1949, jockey Bill Shoemaker won his first race, at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, Calif. It was just one month after he made his professional debut. He would go on to have 8,833 wins over his long career. He won 11 Triple Crown races — four Derbys, two Preaknesses and five Belmonts, The Times reported in his 2003 obituary.
Shoemaker had 26 rides in the Kentucky Derby, more than any other jockey and in 1986 became the oldest jockey to win the Derby, at age 54.
In a 1988 autobiography, excerpted by The Times, he set the record straight on a few subjects, including the story that he was put in a shoebox the night of his birth. Shoemaker — who weighed 98 pounds as an adult — was 2 1/2 pounds when he was born. “One thing that became a legend about me was that I was put into a shoebox and shoved into the stove in my grandmother’s house when I was born.” He said he consulted his grandmother for the real story, who replied: “No, I didn’t stick you in no oven.” She said that after the doctor said “there were no chance” for the tiny infant, she wrapped him warmly and placed him on pillows “on the stove door.” Shoemaker said the heat from the oven kept him warm, “and I lived.”

With the fighting showing signs of intensifying in the country’s south and east, Ukrainian officials told residents of the Luhansk region to evacuate before the onslaught. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Wednesday on Facebook that people were escaping “under the roar of enemy guns.”

In suburbs around the capital, Kyiv, Ukrainian investigators pressed ahead with the grim task of documenting evidence of war crimes in the form of mass graves and mutilated bodies as Ukrainian troops and mine clearers worked to defuse booby traps and explosives left behind by retreating Russian forces.
Moscow continued to brush aside mounting world outrage over the apparent execution-style killings of civilians even as Washington and its Western allies moved to impose sharp new sanctions.
Ukrainian officials accused Russia of trying to cover up war crimes in other occupied areas, saying that Moscow is now aware that haphazard efforts in the Kyiv region had left an abundance of evidence behind.
In the southern port city of Mariupol, where municipal authorities say thousands of civilians have died, the City Council claimed Wednesday on social media that Russia was using mobile crematoriums to dispose of corpses.
World & Nation
Russian forces retreat from the city in Ukraine, leaving behind corpses and live mines.


That allegation could not be verified. Mariupol remains in Ukrainian hands, but many people have been killed trying to leave the city.
Russia has furiously denied committing atrocities, saying graphic video and images that have surfaced in recent days are fake.

As foreign ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gathered in Brussels to weigh options to better support Ukraine in its 6-week-old battle against the Russian invaders, the European Union was set to vote on whether to ban Russian coal imports.

At the same time, Britain, no longer in the EU, imposed sweeping new sanctions, including a full asset freeze on the largest Russian bank, a pledge to end Russian coal and oil imports by the end of the year and the targeting of eight more Russian oligarchs.
In Washington, the Biden administration announced similar measures, targeting two major Russian financial institutions as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two daughters and the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
“I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha,” President Biden said in a tweet.
World & Nation
U.N. votes to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council and the European Union bans Russian coal as Ukraine’s leader calls for more military aid.

“Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in announcing her country’s measures.
The EU steps under consideration, with a vote expected Thursday, would be the most stringent yet by the 27-nation bloc since Russia invaded its neighbor Feb. 24. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking by video link to the Irish Parliament, urged lawmakers to persuade EU partners to enact “sanctions that will really stop Russia’s military machine.”
That would include banning imports of Russian oil and natural gas, a drastic step to which the bloc is beginning to signal openness. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said Wednesday that such a move, despite its disruptiveness, probably would have to occur “sooner or later.”
Although Western leaders have voiced concerns about the Ukraine war spilling over into NATO territory, the alliance said it was prepared for a protracted conflict near its eastern flank.
“The war can end now” if Putin withdraws his forces, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said as foreign ministers from alliance nations, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, began consultations in Brussels. But the fighting could also go on for “many months, even many years,” Stoltenberg said.
World & Nation
German officials say their economy would spiral into recession if they stop purchasing Russian energy.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that it’s “impossible” to know how long the war in Ukraine will continue if not ended through diplomacy.
“The fact that [Putin] is going to concentrate in a smaller geographic area certainly presents the possibility that the violence will continue,” Kirby said. “It could even intensify in that part of Ukraine.”
In Ukraine, Russia has clear military superiority yet has been unable to seize Kyiv or capture and hold major cities. But its forces have devastated parts of Ukraine with long-range missile and artillery attacks, and evidence continues to emerge of atrocities against civilians in areas previously held by Russian troops.
In an overnight video address broadcast in Ukraine,  Zelensky warned compatriots that more hardships lay ahead. He has made increasingly desperate pleas for more Western help, including a scorching speech Tuesday to the United Nations Security Council in which he questioned why the world body even exists if it is helpless in the face of an attack on a sovereign country.
“We don’t have a choice — the fate of our land and of our people is being decided,” Zelensky said in his overnight address. “We know what we are fighting for — and we will do everything to win.”
Mariupol and the northeastern metropolis of Kharkiv — battered by almost daily bombardment — were again prime Russian targets on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said. Putin’s forces for weeks have besieged Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, whose capture would help Moscow create a land bridge to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.
World & Nation
Putin’s war relies on an ultranationalist ideology pushed by far-right Russian thinkers who see Ukrainian nationhood as a fiction.

Another principal target has been the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, where dozens died last week when a missile strike blasted a gaping hole in a government building. The city was hit again Wednesday.
Conditions are increasingly desperate in Mariupol, where tens of thousands of people have been under heavy bombardment, lacking food, water, power and medicine. Ukrainian officials said more than 500 people made it out of Mariupol on Wednesday to the relative safety of the city of Zaporizhzhia.
“The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening,” an assessment by British military intelligence said Wednesday, noting that the cutoff of humanitarian access was probably a tactic “to pressure defenders to surrender.”
While Mariupol’s ordeal has taken place largely out of the world’s sight, Bucha, outside Kyiv, has become an international byword for Ukraine’s suffering after the horrors of its occupation by Russian troops came to light in recent days. On Wednesday, Pope Francis pointed sorrowfully to the town’s plight as a symbol of why the world must support Ukraine.
Welcoming a small group of Ukrainian children at his general audience at the Vatican, the pontiff called for prayers for the country as a whole and for “victims whose innocent blood cries up to the sky.”
Francis then kissed a grimy, bedraggled Ukrainian flag that he said had been brought from Bucha.

Russia’s diplomatic isolation over alleged war crimes deepened Wednesday as Greece became the latest European country to join in the expulsion of Russian diplomats. The government in Athens said a dozen members of embassy or consular staff had been asked to leave, joining what has become a tally of hundreds of Russian diplomats across the EU who have been informed that they are no longer welcome.
In another sign of diplomatic tensions, Ukraine’s ambassador was summoned Wednesday by Hungary’s Foreign Ministry after days of feuding between Prime Minister Viktor Orban — considered Putin’s closest friend in the European Union — and Zelensky. Orban won a landslide reelection victory Sunday.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook that Orban’s government condemns “military aggression” and supports Ukrainian sovereignty, but added that “this is not our war.” Hungary has refused to join other EU countries in providing weapons to Ukraine or allowing arms to be sent to Ukraine via its territory.
Hungary’s tensions with the EU were underscored Wednesday when Orban, speaking to reporters in Budapest, the capital, declared his willingness to pay the country’s energy bills to Russia in rubles, as the Kremlin has demanded. The EU has refused to do so.
Amid the widening repercussions of the war — economic disruptions and threats to the world food supply — another hazard has emerged: naval mines drifting outside the conflict zone.
Officials from Turkey said Wednesday that for the third time, its military had detected a mine drifting in the Black Sea and was preparing to deactivate it. An earlier episode caused the closure of the Bosporus Strait, one of the world’s busiest waterways.

Yellen and Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko walked out of a Group of 20 meeting Wednesday as Russia’s representative started talking.
Several finance ministers and central bank governors also left the room, said an official familiar with the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event was not public. Some ministers and central bank governors who attended the meeting virtually turned their cameras off when the Russian representative spoke, the person said.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said of Yellen’s walkout: “Certainly we support her steps, and it’s an indication of the fact that President [Vladimir] Putin and Russia has become a pariah on the global stage.”
The incident came amid the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, in which finance  leaders  try to tackle the world’s most pressing issues. The brutal effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine have taken center stage, and Treasury Department officials said this week that Yellen would try to avoid contact with Russians who plan to attend some G-20 virtually.
President Biden has said that Russia should not remain a member of the G-20, an international body of the world’s biggest economies that promotes economic cooperation among countries. Indonesia is the host country for the G-20 summit in November.
Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia’s finance minister, when asked about Russia’s participation in the G-20 and about the walkout, said the multilateral forum is a place to “express the views of all members and invitees.”
Psaki reiterated the administration’s position that “we can’t have business as usual” at the G-20 and other international forums when it comes to Russia."

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-06/putins-russia-war-crimes;2022-04-06;Editorial: Putin and Russia must answer for atrocities in Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"In a powerful speech to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of the “most terrible war crimes” since World War II and rightly demanded that Russia face “full accountability” for its atrocities committed during its unprovoked invasion.
“They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children,” Zelensky said of Russian forces. “Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.”
Other nations need not take Zelensky’s word for the existence of Russian war crimes. The world has been disgusted by images of dead civilians lying on the streets of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, from which Russian forces have withdrawn, and horrified by the accounts of abuse. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Tuesday that what happened in Bucha was “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.” President Biden joined other world leaders in calling for the prosecution of Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes.
World & Nation
Rescue efforts continued Monday outside Kyiv as Biden and European leaders called for swift action against Russia for civilian deaths.

Not all the allegations of war crimes involve Bucha. Human Rights Watch says that it has documented several cases of Russian military forces committing “laws-of-war violations” against civilians in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions of Ukraine, including a case of repeated rape and two cases of summary execution. Russia has also been denounced for the bombing of locations where civilians were hiding in Mariupol in March, notably a theater and a maternity hospital.
Predictably — and unpersuasively — Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, denied that Russian troops were targeting civilians, adding that while Bucha was under Russian control “not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence.” On Tuesday, Kremlin officials ludicrously insisted that the bodies in Bucha were fake. Russia continues to blame the victim.
It won’t be easy to hold Russia or its leaders accountable for these atrocities. In his speech to the Security Council, Zelensky complained about the fact that Russia, as a permanent member of the council, could veto any resolution — and thus protect itself. He suggested that Russia could be deprived of that power, but that is unlikely.
Yet other bodies can gather evidence of Russian atrocities. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has opened an investigation of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine. The European Union also plans to send investigators to Ukraine to help the local authorities “document war crimes.”

Opinion
Despite knowing that their payments for Russian oil and gas allow Putin to reequip his army, most EU countries have reacted only with soft measures.

Whether or not they lead to criminal convictions, atrocities by Russian troops strengthen the case for increasing sanctions. On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia. It’s an appropriate move, but should be extended to cover all energy supplies. The Biden administration is also expected to announce new financial sanctions.
Even if Russia had been scrupulous about safeguarding civilians, its unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, a sovereign nation, was an outrage that warranted significant reprisals. That the “special military operation” has been pursued with despicable brutality only strengthens the case for holding Russia accountable and empowering Ukraine to continue to defend itself.
No nation should want to be a party to this continuing savagery. The global community should cut off Russia from any source of funding that fuels its appalling campaign of violence and mutilation against the people of a country it claims are its brethren. While that may cause some pain, especially to Europeans who depend heavily on Russian oil and gas, it is a small price to pay if it can stop the massacre of more Ukrainians."

On Twitter, he posted a photo of himself holding an assault rifle that he captioned: “I’m DONE talking.”
The Navy veteran elaborated while being interviewed Monday on MSNBC’s “The ReidOut.” The national-security analyst said he joined the International Legion of Territorial Defense about a month ago to fight the Russian invasion and assist in the survival of Ukraine.
“I spent quite a bit of time here in the pre-war period, and when the invasion happened, I had friends who are in Donetsk, who are in the Ukrainian army, who are writing to us and telling us, ‘We’re not gonna survive tonight. We’ve been hit 500 times,’” said Nance, who appeared on camera Monday from a secure location and wore combat gear during the interview.
Nance is no longer a contributor-analyst at MSNBC, The Times confirmed Tuesday. However, according to the Hollywood Reporter, Nance was identified as a contributor on air as recently as Feb. 28 — just four days after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Opinion
No one seems to want to define the word ‘imminent.’ Author Malcolm Nance has some thoughts.



On air, he told Reid that he joined the international legion — a multinational group of about 20,000 fighters — because he wanted to help his friends.
“The more I saw of the war going on, the more I thought, ‘I’m done talking, alright. It’s time to take action here,’” he said. “So about a month ago I joined the international legion here in Ukraine, and I am here to help this country fight what is essentially a war of extermination. This is an existential war, and Russia has brought it to this people and they are mass murdering civilians and there are people here like me who are here to do something about it.”
He said that their purpose “is to protect the innocent people of Ukraine from this Russian aggression.”

Opinion
No one seems to want to define the word ‘imminent.’ Author Malcolm Nance has some thoughts.

“It’s not a conventional war, Joy. Even though you have two armed forces going head to head  here. You have another group — I won’t even refer to the Russians as an army — just using mass heavy weapons that are used in combat against civilians,” he explained.
“They are destroying infrastructure, and then you find that they go to the cities and they massacre men, women and children. And that is the fundamental reason everyone is here,” he added. “We really have to assist [the Ukrainians] in any way to stop this, so I decided I came here to assist them with the skills that I have myself.”
Before joining MSNBC, Nance was a career Navy intelligence officer and field interrogator who had been deployed for intelligence operations in the Balkans, Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. He spent spent years in the Middle East studying Al Qaeda and went public against waterboarding torture during the George W. Bush administration.
Nance has written several books, including 2016’s “The Plot to Hack America: How Putin’s Cyberspies and WikiLeaks Tried to Steal the 2016 Election.” His 2020 book, “The Plot to Betray America,” assessed the shifting relationships between former President Trump and U.S. intelligence and military services. His  latest book, “They Want to Kill Americans,” focuses on the ideologies that led to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.

Hundreds or possibly thousands of foreign nationals have swooped into Ukraine to join the battle against the Russians.


His arrival in Ukraine comes as Russian forces have continued their offensive in eastern Ukraine and move toward the Donbas — which includes the besieged city of Mariupol — while leaving mass casualties in their wake.
Nance said he doesn’t believe that he would be targeted by Russians, whom he repeatedly accused of war crimes.
“The war that is being waged here is being waged against everybody. They are not going around hunting for American flag patches or to see who’s Black, who’s Asian, who’s Latino,” he said, adding that they are “fighting side by side, elbow with elbow” with Ukrainian forces and that Russians are “barely” attacking Ukrainian troops.
“Their emphasis seems to be the mass murder of civilians, which seems to be against all laws of war,” he said. “These are war crimes.”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-17/church-slavyansk-palm-sunday;2022-04-17;On Palm Sunday in Ukraine town, residents seek moment of comfort - Los Angeles Times;"On a dreary Sunday morning, with the sirens momentarily silenced even as the thumps of distant battles reverberated overhead, roughly 100 people straggled into the Seraphim Sarovsky church, on the edge of this city at the edge of war.
Few spoke — or even whispered — as they walked with subdued, timid steps past the church’s outer arch and into its ornate confines, genuflecting and kneeling before the altar or kissing the icon of Seraphim Sarovsky. Others lit candles, their eyes lost in the movement of the flames.
For the worshippers gathered here, along with some 30 million of their fellow Ukrainian Orthodox Christians, this was Palm Sunday. In years past, this would have been a joyous celebration; but now, with the Russian army assembling its forces a mere 20 miles away and Sloviansk firmly in its crosshairs, the ceremony was more about comfort than commemoration, a moment to seek refuge in an often-repeated routine.
“Our apartment isn’t far from here. Last night was loud, with lots of shelling, so of course I’m worried,” said Stas, a man in his 40s who gave only his first name for reasons of privacy. He added that he could not leave, because his mother was bedridden and the journey to some kind of sanctuary was not something she could withstand. Beside him stood his wife, Eugenia, and his 5-year-old son, Daniel. “We came to church to calm ourselves, to calm our son.”
World & Nation
More than 4.6 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded, but millions more have stayed to help defend their country. These are their stories.

Many had come for the same reason, seeing in prayer some kind of insurance to protect them from the war now at their doorstep. The service drew even those who normally wouldn’t come to church, such as Valeri. A young man, he bought a votive candle, looking nervous as he approached the holder.
“What should I do with this candle?” he asked a parishioner, before one of the caretakers, an elderly woman, took him to the candle holder and helped him light it.
“I never come to church,” he said, explaining that his family was in Sloviansk and didn’t want to leave. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, and I’m really afraid,” he said. “So I came here.”
Moments later, Valeri Lebed, a white-haired parish priest with an august-looking beard and a gold-brocaded green robe, emerged from a door behind the altar, trailing embers as he swung an incense burner to and fro. He traced a path around the worshippers — some of them men, most of them women donning scarves in bright colors and floral patterns — before returning to the altar and beginning the service with a Bible reading recounting Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem.
He made no mention of the war, perhaps not wanting to bring a sour note for those seeking solace here. Yet elsewhere in the Christian world, the war seemed inescapable.
On Easter Sunday, speaking to a packed St. Peter’s Square where some 100,000 people gathered to hear his geopolitical “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and to the world) speech, Pope Francis pleaded for an end to the conflict, calling for people “not to get used to war” even as he leveled criticism against Russia without mentioning its name.
“Our eyes, too, are incredulous on this Easter of war,” he said. “We have seen all too much blood, all too much violence. Our hearts, too, have been filled with fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing.

“May there be peace for war-torn Ukraine, so sorely tried by the violence and destruction of this cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged.”
The first part of his liturgy concluded, Lebed returned to behind the altar as a trio of women standing in the balcony above began to sing. Their voices resonated in harmony, ringing through the church in a call-and-response with Lebed and the church’s deacon, Roman.
“God have mercy on us,” they repeated, the people bowing and raising their head to mark the verses.
After Communion, the parishioners, many carrying bunches of willow branches wrapped in twine, congregated before the altar as Lebed picked up the aspergillum, a brush he used to sprinkle holy water. They came one at a time, raising their branches above their head while Lebed dipped the aspergillum into a nearby basin and swung it in a powerful arc toward each supplicant, inundating their branch and face with the water.
And so it was the end of the service. Most left quickly, leaving only a few to linger over homemade pierogies, coffee and tea even as the caretakers mopped up the holy water and snuffed out the candles. Standing before the church’s turquoise walls, Roman, the deacon, said he expected more people to come next Sunday, when Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter.
“We don’t have any fear. We didn’t in 2014 either,” he said, referring to the clashes that saw Moscow-backed separatists take Sloviansk before government fighters clawed it back. As he spoke, Daniel rode his bicycle in the churchyard.
“We aren’t going to leave. My faith makes me brave,” he said. “What do I need to worry about if I have my faith in God?”"
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-18/ukraine-russia-mariupol-urban-warfare;2022-04-18;Op-Ed: Why Russia likely won't win the fight in Ukraine's cities - Los Angeles Times;"Russia’s main drive to capture Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has faltered. But its sieges of cities in the east continue apace, as millions either flee, are forced underground or are reportedly taken to Russia by force. Thousands of innocents are presumed dead. At this stage, the fighting in Ukraine’s urban areas is about to enter a new and potentially more lethal phase.
Although Ukraine is a traditionally agrarian society with some industry in its east, cities are its focal points and will decide the fate of the war. To win the war, Russia must still take Kyiv and raise the Russian flag over Maidan, the capital’s Independence Square. But to take the capital, it requires the conquest of several key nodes to gain control over critical chokepoints and shipping routes.
Here is where the war has gone — and probably will continue to go — wrong for Russia. Urban warfare is the most complex, hardest type of warfare for even the best-trained and equipped military in the world. Despite all the proclamations of its modernization and expertise, Russia has shown its shortcomings. Russian troops look more like the Soviet army that bumbled into Afghanistan in the 1980s than the  force that took over Crimea in 2014. In Ukraine, the resistance is stiffer than in Crimea, but the inability of Russia to dominate the cyber, electronic warfare and information  fronts also has been pivotal.
Opinion
This Passover as we observe Ukrainians fleeing their homes to find safety from invaders, Putin comes off, well, pharaonic.

That spells doom for Russia’s forces as it enters the next phase of the war, which will require the penetration of Ukraine’s major cities. Urban warfare requires nimbleness, agility, sophisticated intelligence-gathering operations, doctrine to overcome the inherent challenges of the urban terrain, formations of artillery, tanks, infantry, engineers working in concert, disciplined rank-and-file, strict command and control with authority devolved down to junior officers in the field, and knowledge of local terrain. Russia has none of this.
Yet even the best-trained military in the world would struggle to conquer and control a country as large as Ukraine. And urban warfare reduces all the strengths of the attacker, even if it is a superior military force.  The attackers lack situational awareness to see into dense terrain with full  clarity. They are confined to narrow streets and alleys, and are prevented from spreading out to support each other.
Concrete obstacles and buildings provide the defense with  protection and concealment. The attacking military must crisscross open areas and exposed streets to attack a defender behind walls of concrete. The attackers will have no clue where the enemy is amid the thousands of potential hiding spots. History is full of examples of small, prepared urban defenders striking  potent blows to a superior attacking military —  including Mogadishu, Somalia,  in 1993;  Grozny, the Chechen capital, in 1994;   and Suez City, Egypt, in 1973.
Nor does Russia have sufficient forces — even if reinforced by Chechen or Syrian mercenaries — to control Ukraine’s cities. U.S. Army doctrine says that to hold urban terrain, a military needs three to five times the troops required in any other environment.
If defended well, a city can force a military to send five or more soldiers to attack just one urban defender. Yet Russia commands an estimated 280,000 soldiers in its active army in the war, while Ukraine fields an active force of around 126,000, though it has tens of thousands more in its volunteer militias called the territorial defense force. It’s simple arithmetic.
World & Nation
Photojournalist Carolyn Cole documents Ukrainian life amid Russia’s invasion.


But doctrine matters too. Russia discovered what many armies have learned from history: Bombing cities does not force their inhabitants to give up. It did not do so in the 1942 battle of Stalingrad, the 1945 battle of Berlin, or the 2003 U.S. invasion of Baghdad — ground forces must go in to clear and hold the city if it is to be taken.
The paradox of urban warfare is that the more you bomb a city, the harder it is to take. Bombed buildings are easier to defend if a defender survives the initial bombing because rubble  of concrete and steel makes for nifty bomb-proof bunkers to fight from and  perfect locations to hide improvised explosive devices.
Russia’s failure to quickly penetrate Kyiv and the other major Ukrainian cities allowed the Ukrainians to use the urban terrain to defend their cities. Ukrainian forces blew up bridges, blocked roads, attacked convoys from hidden ambushes and prepared the streets to be “meat grinders” that the Russians feared. No wonder desertions are high, troop morale is flagging and so many Russian commanding officers have reportedly been killed.
Make no mistake, Russia will regroup and retool its military strategy. It will rely less on precision and more on collective punishment. Expect more war crimes and horrific images from the front lines. Sun Tzu famously noted in “The Art of War” that the best warfare strategy is to attack the enemy’s plans, next is to attack alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst is to attack a walled city. Even though cities like Mariupol may look like post-apocalyptic hellscapes, they are the worst places for an invading army to target.
That is the only piece of good news going for Ukraine.

This is, broadly speaking a contest between good guys and bad guys.
A lot of people who fancy themselves foreign policy realists roll their eyes at talk about “good guys” versus “bad guys.” The world is made up of nation-states with interests and those states act rationally on their interests. Good and bad ain’t got nothing to do with it.
I’ve never bought this argument, on either analytical or moral terms.
Yes, nations have interests, but the way they define their interests is not always strictly rational. History is full of examples of nations committing vast resources to causes that are extra-rational. “The mistake of the ‘realists’ is not their interest in the struggle for power but their deliberate neglect of everything else, especially the non-scientific, contingent, very human feelings and beliefs that most powerfully move people,” the late, great Donald Kagan wrote in “Honor Among Nations: Intangible Interests and Foreign Policy.”
Opinion
Urban warfare is the hardest type of battle. Russian forces aren’t prepared for the next phase of the fight into Ukraine’s metropolitan centers.

To claim that, say, North Korea’s foreign and domestic policy is simply an expression of its rational self-interest is to declare you don’t know anything about North Korea — or the decisions its rulers chose to make in turning that society into a xenophobic gulag.
Choices matter. And that’s where the moral failings of realism come in. Realists tend to conflate the interests of rulers with the interests of the ruled. It’s hard to find a sane analyst who argues that Putin invaded Ukraine solely in the name of Russia’s rational self-interest rather than his own notions of glory and historical retribution, and it’s even harder to find one who thinks the invasion is objectively in the interest of the Russian people.
Again, while it would have been in everyone’s interest — however you define it — for Putin not to have committed this monstrous crime, his choice makes it easy to call him and his enablers the bad guys. Deliberately targeting civilians, sanctioning mass executions and rape, not to mention the intentional wholesale erasure of cities is objectively evil. The Russian state tacitly admits this when it refuses to tell its own people what it is doing.

Indeed, the scope of Russia’s lies is so great that the liars are starting to say the quiet part out loud: that truth and truth-telling is an impermissible threat to the Russian regime.
Opinion
Ukraine, with international help, needs to begin data gathering on Russian atrocities before evidence gets lost and victims scatter or disappear.

Margarita Simonyan, the head of RT (formerly Russia Today), which once claimed to be a legitimate news organization, recently declared that, “No big nation can exist without control over information” and that Russia should follow the Soviet or contemporary Chinese model, which would deny people freedom in “the political life of their country, in the informational life of the country.” With media voices like Simonyan in charge, no wonder Putin allegedly polls well in Russia.
There’s equal clarity for the United States. I think the realist case for doing everything possible to assure a Russian defeat is obvious. It is Russian policy to undermine our interests and the interests of our allies around the world.
But there’s a deeper moral realism involved. In the 1990s, we pushed Ukraine to relinquish its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. In 2005, a bipartisan effort led by Sens. Dick Lugar and Barack Obama resulted in Ukraine destroying vast amounts of its conventional weapons, on the assumption that those security guarantees would be honored. In other words, we told them we’d have their back.
Putin said those guarantees — which Russia signed on to — were null and void because the Ukrainian Euromaidan protests in 2013 ushered in a new Ukrainian state. Whether you buy that garbage is immaterial, Putin’s betrayal of his commitments doesn’t release us from ours. And it is in our interest to be seen as a nation that honors its commitments, both moral and legal.
None of this is to say we should send our own troops into Ukraine — not that we wouldn’t be morally justified. Igniting a direct war between two nuclear superpowers is a bad idea. Besides, Ukraine isn’t asking for that. It is asking for the modern equivalent of the arsenal of democracy, and we should give it to them, fast. Because Putin is poised to double-down on his crimes in eastern Ukraine just to save face. It’s not in our interest that he succeed.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-10/city-candidates-criticize-democratic-socialists-ukraine-nato;2022-03-10;Ukraine, NATO and the DSA are L.A. election issues - Los Angeles Times;"L.A.'s local election campaigns traditionally have been framed around neighborhood-level issues — crime, housing, traffic congestion and, in more recent years, the homelessness crisis.
But this year, the bloody invasion of Ukraine by Russia could change that. Several candidates in the June 7 election have begun criticizing the Democratic Socialists of America, whose supporters in L.A. are looking to unseat at least two City Council members, over the group’s response to the overseas conflict.
Days after Russian troops entered Ukraine, the DSA issued a statement calling for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO, which serves as a defense pact for much of Europe and North America. Although the statement denounced Russia’s decision to invade, it also argued against further intervention in Ukraine, and said the U.S. should end the “imperialist expansionism that set the stage for this conflict.”
Councilman Mitch O’Farrell, who is seeking reelection in a district with several Ukrainian churches and cultural institutions, said such statements send the wrong message — both to Ukraine and to the rest of Europe.
Voters, he said, should see a connection between those “irresponsible” stances and labor organizer Hugo Soto-Martinez, a candidate backed by the DSA’s L.A. chapter.
“He’s embraced and is endorsed by DSA, and they have very reckless and dangerous positions. One of them is to abolish the police,” said O’Farrell, whose district spans from Echo Park to Hollywood. “And so I think those positions are out of step with reality.”
Soto-Martinez, in turn, accused O’Farrell of using an international crisis to distract voters from policies that are resulting in evictions and homelessness. He said his campaign is backed by a broad coalition — one that includes DSA.
“And while I personally don’t believe we should pull out of NATO during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the work they do on the ground in our city is why we value our collaboration in this local race,” Soto-Martinez said in a statement.
Asked about the DSA’s stance on police abolition, Soto-Martinez said he wants more mediators, mental health counselors and programs that  make major progress tackling economic and racial inequality and “root causes of crime.”

“Once we do that, like Norway, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Iceland, we won’t need armed officers,” he said.
The back-and-forth comes as the DSA’s L.A. chapter is mobilizing its election volunteers, sending them to knock on doors not only for Soto-Martinez but also for Eunisses Hernandez, a public policy advocate running to unseat Councilman Gil Cedillo.
Neither Hernandez nor a campaign aide had comment on the DSA statement when contacted by The Times.
Cedillo, whose district stretches from Highland Park to Koreatown, said he supports economic sanctions on Russia and continued U.S. membership in NATO.
“DSA has every right to their position, I just fundamentally disagree with them,” he said. “Both Sen. Bernie Sanders and I agree on this very fundamental core issue.”
The DSA’s message on Ukraine has not just gotten the attention of politicians in L.A. Last month, one White House staffer called the statement “shameful,” prompting a rebuttal from DSA’s L.A. chapter. It has also become a campaign issue in several political campaigns in New York.
O’Farrell, Cedillo and other council members have been taking steps to show their support for Ukraine in recent days. Council members have denounced the invasion, urged the city’s pension funds to divest from Russian assets and launched efforts to make Kyiv a sister city.
Councilman Paul Koretz, who is running for city controller and co-authored the Ukraine resolution, said his mother’s family fled Kyiv a century ago to escape  Russian pogroms.
Koretz said he’s been sickened by images of children and adults murdered in Ukraine. And he called the DSA’s push to withdraw from NATO “insanity” — saying such a move would leave the nation’s European allies more vulnerable to attack.
“Abandoning NATO just makes me shake my head and wonder what these people are thinking,” he said.
Councilman Kevin de León, appearing at the Ukrainian Cultural Center in Hollywood, was also critical of the DSA statement. “I’m not sure they’re well equipped to deal with a real-life matter — thousands of people who are being massacred right now,” said De León, a candidate for mayor.

The DSA’s International Committee has been highly critical of NATO, calling it “a tool for imperialist expansion and plundering.”
The DSA put its call to pull out of NATO in its political platform last year, renewing that message after Russia’s invasion. DSA-LA, the group’s L.A. chapter, circulated DSA’s statement on Ukraine and NATO and called for an end to “military and economic warfare on all sides.”
Tal Levy, chair of the electoral committee for DSA-LA, said U.S. participation in NATO has been “a big driver of militarized approaches to conflicts in Europe.”
Levy said he too believes O’Farrell is attempting to use the DSA’s statement as a distraction. And he defended his group’s call to abolish the LAPD, saying city leaders need to start removing police from duties that “do not require armed officers.”
“If we want to talk long term, DSA believes we should build toward a society where armed policing is not necessary,” he said.
DSA-LA has been working to expand its reach into City Hall for years. In 2020, the group canvassed and operated phone banks for urban planner Nithya Raman, who went on to unseat Councilman David Ryu.
During that campaign, Ryu also attempted to make an issue of Raman’s DSA ties, pointing to the group’s calls to defund and abolish the police. He became the first incumbent council member to lose his seat in 17 years.
Since then, DSA-LA has also called for police officers to be barred from forming labor unions. And it plans to assemble a voter guide for its 4,800 members on the upcoming election, Levy said.
Raman, who is a member of the DSA’s L.A. chapter, described the group as a “big-tent organization.”
“While I support their positions on important issues like the need for Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, I don’t align with them on everything — including their comments on NATO,” she said."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-18/in-wars-eighth-week-fall-of-mariupol-seems-imminent;2022-04-18;Russia begins Donbas offensive in eastern Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Ukrainian officials said Monday that Russia began its long-anticipated assault to seize control of their country’s eastern industrial heartland, launching a ground assault along a nearly 300-mile front while pounding the nation, including the western city of Lviv, with a deadly barrage of missile strikes.
“It can now be stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the Ukrainian people. “We will defend ourselves.”
In a new and potentially pivotal stage of the war focused on Ukraine’s vast rural flatlands, Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses along a broad front line in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on Ukrainian television.
“Our servicemen are holding out,” he said, noting that the Russians were able to occupy only two cities.
Since Russia pulled back from the Kyiv region several weeks ago after troops failed to capture the capital, the Kremlin has focused on reinforcing its ground troops in Ukraine’s eastern plains in preparation for a more conventional military-on-military war.
Some U.S. officials and analysts, however, noted that Russia was still moving troops and equipment into the Donbas region and questioned whether Monday’s ground attacks constituted the start of a massive new offensive.
“We believe that the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations,” Pentagon spokesman John  Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing. “We also see that there is active combat going on right now in the Donbas, as there has been for the last several weeks.”
At the same time, Russian forces have continued assaults on other parts of the country. Missile strikes on Monday killed seven people in Lviv, a city once considered a relative haven, local officials said, as Russian forces pressed ahead with their drive to seize the strategic southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine has vowed that defenders would not stop fighting.

That crucial battle is unfolding in the war’s eighth week as the country braced for a full-scale Russian assault in the east that Zelensky said was intended to “literally finish off and destroy” the Donbas, the southeastern region of Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for the last eight years.
Early Monday, Russian troops pushed into the city of Kreminna, killing four people overnight, the Luhansk regional governor said, adding that two more people were dead after shelling in the eastern city of Zolote.
The governor, Serhiy Haidai, announced the casualties in a Facebook post, urging residents to flee even though it was becoming ever more dangerous to do so.
“Save yourselves!” he said.
Civilians have for weeks been urged to escape the eastern battle zone, but on Monday, for a second day in a row, Ukrainian officials said the two sides had failed to agree on setting up humanitarian corridors for noncombatants’ use.
In a bleak benchmark, the United Nations says more than 5 million people have now fled the country since Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion to control Ukraine and topple its government.
Since the war began, Western nations have wielded ever-tightening economic sanctions in a bid to get Putin to halt the carnage. On Monday, in televised remarks made during a virtual meeting with economic officials, the Russian leader scoffed at the idea that financial punishment could force him to bend.
Citing a bounceback in the value of the ruble and a record trade surplus, Putin said the Western strategy of an “economic blitz has failed.” He acknowledged that domestic inflation has jumped in Russia, but said state measures were being taken to alleviate the effect on individuals, and that Western consumers were faring far worse.
Left unmentioned in Putin’s remarks was Russia’s uneven progress on the battlefield. While seizing chunks of territory in Ukraine’s east and south, Russian forces have also suffered a series of stinging military setbacks. Those include the sinking last week of Russia’s Black Sea flagship in what Western and Ukrainian military officials say was a Ukrainian missile strike.
The renewed long-distance attacks on Kyiv and the country’s western hub, Lviv, are viewed as part of a concerted recent effort by Moscow to target infrastructure and strike at armament manufacturers in preparation for its eastern offensive.
Increasing Russian bombardment of locales like Lviv, a gateway from other European capitals, and the capital, fairly calm for most of this month, could also stem the flow of foreign dignitaries who have been steadily arriving in Kyiv for talks with Zelensky. The Ukrainian president, in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN, said he believed President Biden would visit, although the White House said last week there were no such plans.
Meanwhile, Russia claimed Monday to have staged hundreds of strikes overnight aimed at what it said were military targets across Ukraine. A statement from the Defense Ministry said 16 Ukrainian military facilities had been destroyed.
That account could not be independently verified, but the intensifying tempo of strikes is in line with Western military assessments that Russian preparations for a devastating assault in the east are rapidly moving forward. Over the last four days, Russia has added 11 battalion tactical groups to its forces in the east and south, bringing the total number to 76, a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday.
Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that while the Russian military appeared to suffer from “chronic difficulties” of logistics and sustainment, it had recently moved in aviation support and artillery units ahead of larger ground movements by troops.
“The Russians are trying to learn from their mistakes,” Kirby said. The Kremlin was trying to establish conditions for “more aggressive, more overt and larger ground maneuvers” in the Donbas region, he said.
Still, analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a report Monday that Russia’s eastern offensive is “unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous Russian offensives.” Although the Russians might be able to wear down Ukrainian counterparts or achieve minimal gains through the heavy concentration of artillery and numbers, the report said, they were unlikely to have solved their underlying problems of poor coordination and low morale.
“Russian forces did not take the operational pause that was likely necessary to reconstitute and properly integrate damaged units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine into operations in eastern Ukraine,” the analysts wrote.

World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

Another key prong in the Russian offensive is Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, whose capture would allow Russian forces to link up along a land corridor between Russian-controlled areas and the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.
The city’s defenders ignored a surrender demand on Sunday by Russia, but Ukrainian officials have acknowledged that the holed-up Ukrainian forces have only one real redoubt, a sprawling steelworks complex.
The city itself is an all-but-annihilated prize. Under siege and bombardment since the war’s first days, Mariupol lies largely in ruins, with unburied bodies lying in the streets. More than 430,000 people lived in what was a bustling metropolis before the invasion; about 100,000 are thought to remain, under desperate humanitarian conditions.
Sergey Volina, the commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, said Monday that some of those wounded in Mariupol died in “unbearable torment” each day without medicine, disinfectant or pain relief. Civilians who remained without water, food or heat were in urgent need of evacuation, he said.
“The city needs an unblocking immediately,” he posted on Facebook. “We need heavy weapons for this.... Mariupol can be saved. We are ready to fight to the last drop of blood. But we need to know that the world has done its best to do so. Then we are ready to do even the impossible for our country.”
Mariupol is “contested and isolated,” a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday. If Russian forces take full control of the city, the official said, Russia’s military leaders will be able to redeploy to the Donbas region a significant number of the nearly  dozen battle units currently fighting at Mariupol.
Some of the new $800 million in weapons that Biden authorized have arrived in Ukraine — four flights over the weekend and another scheduled within 24 hours — and should be deployed quickly, the official said. In the next few days, the U.S. will begin training Ukrainian officers in the use of howitzers, at a location outside Ukraine, the official said, without giving more detail.
Both U.S. and Ukrainian officials believe harsh economic sanctions imposed on Russia have hurt its ability to replenish weapons.
“Without imports, they can’t even do that,” Zelenksy said Monday in a video address. “And when all the loopholes used to circumvent sanctions are closed, and when even tougher sanctions are imposed, restoring Russia’s missile capabilities will be unrealistic.”
In a previous overnight address, Zelensky said that the Russian troops that destroyed Mariupol “want to wipe out other cities and communities” in two eastern regions, Donetsk and Luhansk.
Russia controls part of both areas now, in the form of self-declared independent statelets, but Putin has signaled he intends to try to take the entire Donbas, as the larger region is called.
Zelensky, appealing again for international shipments of heavy weaponry to try to beat back the Russian offensive in the east, declared that every delay in providing armaments is “permission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians — this is how Russia interprets it.”
In Lviv, where many of those fleeing violence elsewhere in Ukraine have taken shelter, the city’s mayor and regional governor said seven people died in the volley of Russian missile strikes early Monday.
Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said in addition to those killed, 11 people were injured, including a child. A strike apparently aimed at a vehicle-repair facility blew out windows in a nearby hotel where people displaced by fighting elsewhere were staying, he said on social media.
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, condemned Russian forces’ “indiscriminate and illegal shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure” on Monday. “Attacks on Lviv and other cities in western Ukraine show that no part of the country is spared from the Kremlin’s senseless onslaught,” Borrell said in a statement.
In all, the number of people fleeing the war has reached epic proportions. Along with the millions of Ukrainians who have sought haven outside the country, more than 200,000 students and migrant workers residing in Ukraine before the war have also departed, the U.N.’s refugee agency said.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, over the weekend cited those figures on what he called a “somber Easter Sunday,” saying the holiday should serve as a reminder of the hope that the “methods and language of war” would not prevail over those of peace.
In Ukraine’s east, amid the drumbeat of shelling and the sustained notes of air-raid sirens, evacuations have slowed, particularly after a horrific strike this month on a rail station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk that killed about 60 people.
Oxana Federova, from the city of Toretsk, some 23 miles southeast of Kramatorsk, had driven to the city with her grandfather in their Soviet-era car to try to find an open bank. All the ones in their town were closed, the 32-year-old shop manager said.
But although Kramatorsk is a jumping-off point for departures by bus, Federova had no intention of going.
“Why do I need to leave here? Would you leave your house? If everything you own is here, your family is here, would you go?” she said. “We’re not rich people, but this is our Ukraine, not Russia’s Ukraine.”

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-07/ukraine-russia-misinformation-classroom-lessons;2022-03-07;Teachers help students with Russian Ukraine war misinformation - Los Angeles Times;"In Ricardo Martinez’s sophomore English classes, one question keeps coming up among his students as the Russian invasion of Ukraine gets bloodier and more destructive: Am I going to get drafted to go to war?
While some of his students at Sotomayor Arts and Sciences Magnet in Glassell Park have been disengaged from the current news cycle, with its images of rumbling tanks and bombed-out buildings, others have expressed fear about what the war might mean for them.
Martinez surveyed his students to find out what they thought about the crisis, and he found out they had questions about what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is, if the nation would be plunged into the next Great Depression, if World War III was coming.
Teenage boys in his classes at the Los Angeles school more than 6,000 miles from Kyiv, Ukraine, worried that they would be sent abroad to fight.
“I thought they were joking around, because the kids who were asking were not the most serious students,” Martinez said. But when he realized they were distressed, he carved out time to explain that the U.S. does not currently have a draft, that former President Nixon ended it in 1973, but that it also could be reinstated.
Pivoting briefly away from the essays he’d assigned about short stories they’d read in class, Martinez showed his students political cartoons to help them understand Russia’s actions and the history of the Soviet Union. They discussed the invasion and the possibility of escalation. To ease their anxiety, he urged them to find Ukrainian groups to support.

“It’s a teachable moment, and it’s an opportunity for them to learn about a part of the world they’re not exposed to,” Martinez said.
As the news of Russia invading Ukraine dominates news cycles, teachers throughout the country are helping students navigate the wave of emotions that comes with devastating world events. They’re providing much needed historical and political context. And they are doubling down on media literacy practices amid the flood of misinformation online.

With current events colliding in the classroom, they are crafting new lessons to address the questions they know will arise.
But teaching about the invasion of Ukraine can be tricky. The situation changes daily. Ukrainian or Russian students may be personally affected by the violence thousands of miles away. And some students may be struggling with pandemic fatigue or other stressors.
At Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Eastvale, a city 15 miles west of Riverside, Kathryn Greene spent evenings during the invasion’s first week putting together a timeline of historical events to give her sophomore students important context.
Many came to class believing they were watching the war play out in TikTok videos — including one supposedly showing a Ukraine fighter jet shooting down Russian aircraft. The Ukrainian pilot was nicknamed “The Ghost of Kyiv.”
“It is at a whole new level this year with social media,” Greene said. “Students come in with 10 to 15 minutes’ worth of questions, and it’s everything from real, legitimate questions to conspiracy theories.”
Greene teaches world history and Advanced Placement world history. Media literacy has long been a part of her curriculum. So, along with putting together lesson plans on the history of Ukraine and its fight for independence, she also spoke to her students about steps they can take to spot misinformation: reading beyond headlines, considering the source, and asking an expert, such as a teacher or librarian, to confirm or dispute the facts.
“I’m making sure they are heard and feel valued, and [also] making sure they don’t get caught in misinformation memes,” she said.
Students in Anibal Hernandez’s class at Sotomayor Arts and Sciences Magnet were fired up after seeing the viral video of “The Ghost of Kyiv.” They came to Hernandez with several questions about the war when it broke out. Hernandez, who is in his first year of teaching, used their enthusiasm to explain historical terms, such as “the Soviet Union,” “NATO” and “Cold War.”
On Wednesday, Hernandez showed a condensed version of President Biden’s State of the Union address, the part about sanctions against Russia and escalating punishments. Some students leaned forward as Biden’s words were broadcast from a ceiling projector. Others slouched in their seats or rested their heads on their desk.
Afterward, Hernandez brought up their previous discussions.
“What do you remember from last week?” he asked.
“Ukraine shot down five jets,” one student said, referencing “The Ghost” as others nodded along.
“The interesting thing about that though — remember last week we talked about when things are starting to come out, about ‘the Ghost of Kyiv’?” Hernandez said. “Is that story true?”
“It’s at issue right now,” said Iren Stanfield, a senior. “Supposedly it’s been confirmed, but nobody really knows, people are just posting it.”
“Right,” Hernandez said. “The former president [of Ukraine, Petro] Poroshenko, said this guy exists, but that’s a complex part of this war. We don’t know entirely what could be true, what could be false. Some people are using video games to pass them off as what’s happening in Russia and Ukraine.”
In fact, the video claiming to show “the Ghost of Kyiv” was fact-checked by news organizations. It’s actually a video simulation.
Atiana Pineda Rodriguez, a junior, found the context of the invasion helpful. When Hernandez asked his students if they wanted to continue following the war during class, the 16-year-old nodded. The war was a daily topic in her family, she said, often over dinner. She said she was eager to explain NATO to her father.
“It’s really unfair that the Ukrainian people are getting attacked,” Atiana said. “I really do wish the U.S. could help out ... so this could all be over.”
Social studies teachers also responded to the grim news by adjusting lesson plans and gathering online resources.
“It was a ‘drop everything’ moment,” said CherylAnne Amendola, who teaches history at Montclair Kimberley Academy in New Jersey. “Students aren’t going to learn anything about the Declaration of Independence when they hear news that a nuclear power has started war with another country.”
In River Forest, a suburb 11 miles west of Chicago, Samantha Stearns begins classes with 15 minutes of Q&A with her eighth-graders. They had just finished a unit on the formation of the Soviet Union, so they discussed “the consequences of historical decisions” and the tension that had long existed in Eastern Europe.  Stearns, who has taught for 12 years, had her students analyze viral videos and discern whether they were real, manipulated or from a movie. One student followed up with her afterward to show her how a manipulated video had garnered millions more views than when they had first viewed it.
“When you give them the space to be part of the conversation, it gives them feelings of empowerment,” Stearns said. “They will go out and find these videos, critique them and then come back and tell me that they showed their parents. It’s a good exercise of them being critical thinkers.”
In Daniel Jocz’s class at Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, a magnet school, his own students are helping set the facts straight. In one of his classes, a student lauded Russian President Vladimir Putin for helping people in eastern Ukraine, but another student, who is Russian, pushed back.
“That’s the propaganda machine. I know because we always see this in state media,” the Russian student said.
His comment led to a discussion about condemning the actions of the Russian government instead of the Russian people, not all of whom share Putin’s views. Another student brought up the alleged poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny by Russian operatives, which many students had not known about.
“They’re seeing each other as resources that they can learn from, versus just classmates,” Jocz said.
Andrew Swan, an eighth-grade social studies teacher in Massachusetts, said presidential elections and major events, such as the U.S. Capitol riot, are times when teachers have reached out about what other educators are reading and teaching.
“We’re generally trying to teach kids the same thing, which is to understand the world better,” Swan said.
On Monday, after his eighth-graders came back from a weeklong break, many were confused and peppered him with questions: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? What’s the point of invading a country that doesn’t want you? Will this really become World War III?
Swan came prepared with a lesson plan about the conflict. He also took a few minutes to show them a 10-second clip of a crying soldier — apparently Russian — to discuss the information war happening online.
The best part of the grim lesson that day?
His students understood that the person in the video clip may not actually be a Russian soldier.
They needed more information, he said, before they made up their minds.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-17/united-nations-russia-ukraine-security-council-reform;2022-04-17;Second Opinion: The U.N. has to reform itself to bring peace to Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"The English author H.G. Wells felt the need to call World War I “the war to end all wars.”
What prompted him to denounce war were the many horrors of that conflict, which included genocide and scores of civilian casualties.
History has proven Wells wrong time and time again. Yet his statement should not be read empirically, as if acknowledging the scale of the death and destruction of World War I would prevent all future armed conflict. Instead, his lesson from WWI is that no matter how many wars take place, we need to tirelessly work toward peace.
Fast forward about 100 years, and we see Russia committing atrocities in Ukraine such as those that shocked Wells.
Opinion
Being in the inner circle is not restraining the Kremlin. It should be deprived of its standing in the international community.

Our international institutions are supposed to rein in such violence. Specifically, the United Nations’ mission includes securing peace and suppressing aggression.
Yet we are running up against a critical issue in the U.N.: the veto power of Security Council members. If one of the permanent members — France, Great Britain, Russia, China or the United States — finds some initiative that calls for coordinated international action to be contrary to their national interests, that country has the prerogative to cancel it. That is what has blocked international action in Ukraine: Although 11 of the 15 members of the Security Council voted in February to support a resolution to denounce the war, the resolution went nowhere because Russia vetoed it (China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained).
A successful vote would not only have denounced the conflict but laid out concrete next steps to reestablish peace, including negotiations or launching a peacekeeping operation with soldiers and civilian personnel.

This failure doesn’t let the U.N. off the hook. Articles 39, 41 and 42 of its charter call upon Security Council members to decide when peace is threatened or has been breached and then address the situation — as it did with some success in Liberia, where, in the aftermath of the civil war, U.N. personnel from various countries worked on reforming the military and police, reducing HIV/AIDS transmission and creating programs for the country’s youth.
The promise of the U.N. endures in this mandate to facilitate on peace. What needs to change is the Security Council. And change to the U.N. is possible. We have seen it in the past.
Less than 20 years after the U.N. was created, the organization increased the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council from six to 10. Although non-permanent members lack veto powers and serve for only two years without the chance to be reelected, the change successfully widened participation by including more countries from different regions.
Another reform took place in 2005, when the General Assembly voted to give the 54-member Economic and Social Council more responsibilities, including assessing international development and the power to convene ad hoc meetings on humanitarian issues. The council has since used this power to support reconstruction efforts in Haiti following the earthquake that devastated that country in 2021.
Still, the most significant change in international institutions was the unlikely creation of the U.N. itself out of the failure of its predecessor, the League of Nations.
Opinion
Ukraine, with international help, needs to begin data gathering on Russian atrocities before evidence gets lost and victims scatter or disappear.

The shock Wells experienced after World War I was shared by leaders such as U.S. President  Wilson, who helped found the league — the first sincere attempt to bring countries together formally to resolve problems through diplomacy. But Wilson’s hope fell apart when the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the league charter, removing the emerging superpower from the organization during its vulnerable origins.
Participating countries ultimately failed to find common ground. For one thing, they initially excluded the Soviet Union, later allowed it as a member and then expelled it for invading Finland.
The league’s failure to cooperate made it incapable of stopping aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. It took the Second World War for some leaders to see the error of their ways.
In 1941, Great Britain and the United States met to create the Atlantic Charter, proclaiming that states should not increase their territory at the expense of others and that governments were instead tasked to develop economically, cooperate and disarm.
Particularly relevant to the U.N.‘s current challenges, as the U.S. and Britain moved to expand their charter globally, Russia had to be won over. Stalin feared that Soviet interests would not be represented in the new institution. So the founding countries developed the Security Council veto partly to reassure the Soviets. (Roosevelt also told Stalin to wait until after the 1944 election to take Poland, a compromise meant to entice Stalin.)
Opinion
Globalization interwove economies of very different nations, now coming apart as autocracies ally with the Kremlin and democracies stand with Ukraine.

When the U.N. charter was signed in San Francisco, in 1945, 50 countries — including the Soviet Union — agreed. It is this spirit of maneuvering for peace that should drive Security Council reform. There needs to be a way to overturn the veto — for instance,  by allowing an override if two-thirds of the General Assembly decides to, and/or if four out of five Security Council members agree.
Such a change requires approval from not only two-thirds of the General Assembly — which has already voted against Russia’s invasion — but every member of the Security Council. To bring Russia along, other countries need to issue a credible threat where it matters most: natural gas. Europe, with the U.S. and perhaps major gas exporters such as Qatar, should completely cut off natural gas exports from Russia to any part of the world if it continues to block Security Council actions, including support for a veto override.
Other countries, including the U.S., will have to accept that their future interests would be served by having to cooperate instead of acting unilaterally via veto. Perhaps the rising cost of gas and grain, just one consequence of the U.N.'s impotence on Russia, will make the U.S. rethink the value of unchecked veto power.
H.G. Wells was right — no matter how challenging, peace is essential. The Security Council is tasked to uphold it. With the Ukraine-Russia conflict again showing the horrors of war, the U.N.'s future now depends on whether it can reform its own structure.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-03/dnipro-ukraine-jewish-history-russia-invasion;2022-04-03;Op-Ed: Ukraine can find inspiration from its resilient Jewish community - Los Angeles Times;"There weren’t supposed to be any Jews left in Dnipro.
Not after Bohdan Khmelnytsky rallied the Cossacks 350 years ago to rise up against Poland and, along the way, to massacre the Jews. Ukrainians still celebrate him as a liberator and folk hero, displaying his statue in public squares and his picture on vodka bottles. Russians toast him for reuniting Ukraine with Mother Russia. But what Jews in that part of the world remember are stories of how “Khmel the Wicked” burned, beheaded or strangled their ancestors, denouncing them as footmen of Polish nobility. And how he burned their synagogues, except the holy Torahs, which his soldiers laid out in the streets to be trampled.
Adolf Hitler brought more advanced appliances of extermination to Dnipro, an isolated city of 1 million southeast of Kyiv.  In October 1941, during the harvest festival of Sukkot, Nazi troops and Ukrainian police marched 11,000 Jews to a ravine on what is now the campus of the Dnipropetrovsk State University of Internal Affairs, then mowed them down with machine guns. A band played throughout to mask the screams. All told, 20,000 Jews were executed in the city during World War II.
The Soviets were subtler. Under their regime, Jews were identified as their own nationality — Jew — on their passports, which was supposed to signal that the communists accepted their religion and culture. In fact, the stamp set them apart, and the Kremlin drove home the message by shuttering 42 of Dnipro’s 43 synagogues. There was no effort to track down the hooligans who broke into the remaining shul during High Holiday services in 1963. In this era of tight state control over commerce and private life, there also was no kosher food, no bar mitzvahs, no circumcisions.
Then there were the Israelis, and to a lesser extent Americans and Germans. By opening their doors to immigrants after the Soviet Union fell 30 years ago, they unwittingly completed the displacement begun by the Cossacks, Nazis and Soviets. The opportunity to leave Dnipro was a godsend to nearly 30,000 Jewish Ukrainians who took it. It felt like a death blow to the Jewish community they left behind.
But there are still Jews in Dnipro. Thousands of them, some say tens of thousands.
Besieged by Russia’s weeks-long attack, Ukraine as a whole is counting on its own version of this story of improbable survival, of a community decimated but never erased. You can see it today in Dnipro, where many men proudly display their Jewishness with traditional beards and side curls, black hats and black robes, while women don sheitels and other traditional head coverings. Other Jews there blend in with their Slavic surroundings, yet take quiet joy in getting to know what it means to be Jewish.
Hundreds from both groups gathered this month at the elegantly restored Golden Rose Synagogue to celebrate Purim, the holiday that commemorates the saving of Jews from the murderous Haman. This year it carried a double meaning, with Russian President Vladimir Putin looming large as a threat to them and their country.
The city’s Jewish community is now sheltering Jewish and non-Jewish refugees from the shell-shocked metropolis of Kharkiv, the beleaguered port of Mariupol and other war-ravaged parts of Ukraine. That long-standing open-arms approach — enabled in part through a 30-year collaboration with their Jewish sister city, Boston — helps explain why Dnipro is hailed as the most thriving Jewish outpost in the former Soviet Union.

Despite another chance to escape to Israel or America, communal officials say most of the city’s Jews are not just remaining but defiantly resisting Putin’s month-old invasion and airstrikes against their city. What’s happening there is another lens into a Bible-worthy story of Ukrainians uniting behind their unlikely wartime leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, who is himself Jewish.
The seeds for Dnipro’s Jewish renewal were sown more than two decades ago, when I featured that city, then known as Dnipropetrovsk, in my book on the contemporary Jewish diaspora. Shmuel Kaminetsky, a Chabad rabbi born in Israel, rebuilt the local Jewish community according to a simple motto: Whatever it takes. Sometimes he borrowed, convincing 10 rabbis-in-training from Morristown, N.J., and Montreal to come to Dnipro for a year. Sometimes he charmed, such as when he persuaded Jews from Boston, London, Miami and elsewhere to commit millions of dollars to programs for the sick, the poor and the young in a city they barely knew, in a region the world had given up on. Sometimes he brokered, like when he secured medical treatment for a local crime boss in return for a hands-off policy toward Jews.
The miraculous results are visible today at the Menorah Center, a marble-clad collection of kosher restaurants, communal and religious buildings, a luxury hotel, and a youth hostel. Its boosters say that it is the largest multifunction Jewish complex in Europe.
Ukraine’s Jewish story has always blended the horrific and heroic. Consider what happened in the wake of the Khmelnytsky massacres in the mid-1600s. That brutality, and the savage Russian-Swedish war that followed, helped produce Sabbateanism, the largest messianic movement in Jewish history. The cycle repeated itself from the 1880s through the early 1900s, as violent pogroms encouraged Jews to launch Zionist and socialist organizations.
We’re witnessing an equally heroic effort now in Jewish Dnipro, turning tragedy into triumph — an effort that is inspiring the world as well as local residents, who are choosing to stay rather than emigrate.
Jews there tell a joke that captures the paradox of their repeating history. “When the last Jew leaves the city,” they say, “2,000 Jews will see him off.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said that two senior U.S. officials — Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III — would arrive Sunday in the capital, Kyiv, in what would be the highest-level delegation dispatched by President Biden since the war began two months ago.
Several other world leaders have made the trip in recent weeks to meet with Zelensky, ramping up pressure on Washington to follow suit. Neither the Pentagon nor the State Department publicly confirmed the trip.
Moscow is pressing ahead with an offensive in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as it seeks to gain full control over the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, known together as the Donbas.
Western analysts and officials said Russia has not made major territorial gains since Monday, when both sides said that the fighting in the east — Moscow’s main focus — had entered a new phase.


In a statement Saturday, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that a day earlier the military had hit a Russian command post near Kherson, a port city on the Black Sea that Russia seized early in the war and is a key part of its strategy to take territory in the south. The statement — which said that two Russian generals had been killed and that another was badly wounded and evacuated — could not be independently verified.
In the southeast, the devastated port city of Mariupol remains contested, Ukraine said Saturday, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent claim of victory. But the situation was dire: Russia continued to bombard the giant steelworks plant where holdout Ukrainian forces and an unknown number of civilians were holed up. Late Saturday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces attempted to storm the factory complex in a final all-out effort to crush resistance.



World & Nation
Russian forces have more artillery, tanks and heavy fighting units than Ukraine, but they have been plagued by problems as they enter a pivotal battle for eastern Ukraine.
A new British military intelligence assessment early Saturday said heavy fighting was still occurring in Mariupol, despite Russia’s “stated conquest” of the city.
Another assessment, from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, predicted that Russia would “starve out” the remaining defenders and the civilians trapped alongside. Putin ordered a tight blockade of the steel plant, the Ukrainians’ final redoubt, which is a sprawling collection of above- and below-ground structures.
Communications have been largely severed for weeks with Mariupol, strategically located on the Sea of Azov, and the horrors of weeks of bombardment and besiegement are only beginning to be fully uncovered. Satellite imagery has revealed at least one mass grave on the city’s outskirts, and the Associated Press reported that another mass burial site had been detected.

Municipal authorities have said an estimated 20,000 people have died in the siege of the city, which has lasted nearly the entire duration of the war. Control of Mariupol is vital to Russia’s aim of linking the part of the Donbas it controls with the Crimean peninsula, which it seized and annexed eight years ago.
Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said authorities were trying to take some civilians out of Mariupol on Saturday, but she warned on Telegram that Russians were trying to divert some of those fleeing, pushing them toward Russia-controlled areas. Later reports indicated the evacuation efforts failed again.
Russia on Friday signaled a potential expansion of its war aims, with a senior military officer saying Moscow also sought a land corridor linking the Donbas to a Russian separatist territory in the neighboring country of Moldova, to the west. That would involve seizing Ukraine’s entire southern seacoast, including the coveted port city of Odesa, which would leave the country landlocked.
Indeed, Russian forces hit Odesa with a barrage of missiles. Ukrainian officials said a 3-month-old baby was among five people killed. Zelensky seemed particularly touched by the loss.
“The war started when this baby was 1 month old,” the president said. “Can you imagine what is happening? ... They are just bastards.”

World & Nation
It has been more than a month since Russian troops advanced on Rubizhne, a small, well-appointed city nestled in a verdant slice of land. Families have taken refuge in a bombed cultural palace.
Western governments including the U.S. administration called on Russia on Friday to respect Moldova’s sovereignty. The former Soviet republic, which is small and impoverished, said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to express “deep concern” about the comments regarding its breakaway region.
It remained unclear, though, whether the Russian general’s remarks represented a new official policy on Moscow’s war goals. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.
Russia’s main focus is the east, where it redeployed its forces east after failing last month to seize Kyiv.
The British military intelligence assessment of the situation in the east reported “no major gains in the last 24 hours, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts.”

Just outside the Donbas, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, is partially blockaded by Russian forces, the Ukrainian military said Saturday. The city, once home to nearly 1.5 million people, has been pounded by almost nonstop bombardment for weeks.
With punishing Russian artillery fire aimed at towns and cities across the Luhansk region, its governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on television Saturday that in some areas, Ukrainian troops pulled back to new defensive lines. The front line was fluid, with some territory changing hands repeatedly.
Moscow’s forces are still massing in preparation for an expected wider attack. Ukrainian officials say some Russian units are being shifted away from Mariupol to other parts of the east. Pentagon officials had anticipated such a shift once Russia was confident it had conquered Mariupol.


World & Nation
President Biden’s decision to dramatically ramp up delivery of artillery guns to Ukraine comes at a potentially crucial point in the war.
With new evidence coming to light daily suggesting atrocities against civilians by Russian troops in territory they previously occupied or now control, Zelensky repeated his call for war crimes accountability.
“The occupiers are trying to achieve a primitive goal — to kill as much as possible and destroy everything they see,” Zelensky said.
Investigators are at work in Bucha and other satellite towns and suburbs of Kyiv, documenting evidence of execution-style killings of civilians and other atrocities. More than 1,200 people are believed to have been killed during a Russian occupation of areas near Kyiv lasting about a month.
The Kremlin is also coping with the aftermath of one of its biggest symbolic defeats of the war: the sinking of the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, in what the Kyiv government and Western military officials say was a Ukrainian missile strike.
More than a week after the ship went down, Russia’s Defense Ministry confirmed the death of one sailor and said 27 others were missing, though large numbers were still apparently unaccounted for. The crew consisted of nearly 500 sailors, and some families have taken to social media to express anguish over the still-unknown fate of loved ones among the crew.
Efforts to end the war through negotiation have so far been fruitless, but United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres is to meet in the coming week — separately — with Zelensky and Putin. The U.N. says the talks in the countries’ respective capitals will center on a cease-fire and efforts to pluck civilians from the battle zone.
Sunday is Easter for most Orthodox Christians, a major religion in both Ukraine and Russia.

In the town of Borodyanka, near Bucha, churches were collecting donations of holiday cakes and other food. With spring in the air, Inna Korohodina, 45, was planting potatoes with her husband and daughter at the home of her parents, where the family was trapped when the Russians rolled into town last month.
“These potatoes saved our life,” she said. “If we hadn’t had the potatoes, we would have starved.”
Next door, Valentyna, 82, was also working in the garden. She had stayed alone in her house, surviving on salted cucumbers, potatoes and buckwheat, and venturing out just once, to share her only loaf of bread with a neighbor. “I was scared, but I was more worried about my children,” she said, declining to give her last name.
Less than a mile away at the city cemetery, about 50 people gathered for the funeral of a mother, father and son who died in a Russian missile attack on their apartment building. The woman, Halyna Bobrovskiy, 59, was a family doctor.
Flocks of birds flew over as the sun peeked out for the first time in many weeks.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-02/explainer-whats-next-for-europes-natural-gas-during-war;2022-04-02;News Analysis: What's next for Europe's natural gas during war in Ukraine? - Los Angeles Times;"Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding payment in rubles for natural gas — or else. Germany is talking about gas rationing in case of a cutoff. Prices for the fuel used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry are through the roof.
There’s a lot of discussion around natural gas in Europe against the background of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to say the least.
Here are key things to know:
What is Putin proposing?
Putin has said importers of Russian gas must now pay in rubles. European leaders said no dice — their contracts say euros or dollars and one side can’t abruptly change that.
Changing currency would normally follow extended negotiations, analysts say, with customers demanding something in return for being exposed to fluctuations that would come with paying in the less-stable ruble.
The open questions about what the change could mean have sent shudders through energy markets, raising uncertainty about whether Europe’s natural gas could be cut off and cause a major hit to the economy. But Russia also relies on oil and gas sales to fund its government as sanctions have squeezed its financial system.
The Kremlin offered what could be seen as a loophole. Importers would simply have to establish an account in dollars or euros at a designated bank, then a second account in rubles. The importer would pay the gas bill in euros or dollars and direct the bank to exchange the money for rubles.
In any case, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the change won’t happen immediately: “Payments on shipments in progress right now must be made not this very day, but somewhere in late April, or even early May.”

European leaders have rejected the proposal as “blackmail” and say payments will continue in dollars and euros.
German officials wouldn’t discuss the impact of Putin’s decree other than to say they were examining it. Economy Ministry spokeswoman Beate Baron noted that Russia’s Gazprombank has been given 10 days to explain the procedure, “and of course we will in turn look carefully at that.”
A top European Commission energy official tweeted that the European Union was coordinating “to establish a common approach.”
What is Putin after?
The Kremlin says the change is necessary because Western sanctions have frozen its reserves of foreign currency. Because the measure targets importers in “unfriendly countries,” it can be seen as retaliation for the sanctions that have cut many Russian banks off from international financial networks  and led some Western companies to abandon their businesses in Russia.
The economic advantages for Russia aren’t clear. In theory, payment in rubles would increase demand for the currency and help the Kremlin prop up its exchange rate, which has regained ground from its initial plunge after the invasion. But gas exporter Gazprom already has to sell 80% of its foreign earnings for rubles, so the boost to the currency from converting the remaining 20% could be minimal.
The Kremlin indicates it also wants to extend ruble payments to other commodities, such as metals.
One motive may be political, said Stefan Meister, head of the program on international order and democracy at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
“Russia is not interested in stopping gas, but it wants a kind of political victory,” Meister said. “It wants to show that Putin dictates the conditions under which it exports gas.”
The move is partly aimed at Russia’s domestic audience, Meister said, with Putin telling his people: “Look, these are enemy states and now they have to pay under a different scheme.”
“So I think that this is also about getting support inside the country, defining who are the enemies,” Meister said.
Another motive could be to protect the designated bank, Gazprombank, from being hit by sanctions because it would be the conduit for the payments that keep gas flowing, Meister said. It is the third-largest bank in Russia, and like Sberbank, the largest, it has not been cut off from the international SWIFT payment system.
What’s the state of the gas supply for Europe?
Coordinated U.S. and European Union sanctions exempt payments for oil and gas. That is a White House concession to European allies who are much more dependent on energy from Russia, which provides 40% of Europe’s gas and 25% of its oil.
Gas continued to flow Friday into the European pipeline system from Russia, according to pipeline operators’ websites.
Many aren’t happy  that European utilities are still buying energy from Russia, which on average got 43% of its annual government revenue from oil and gas sales between 2011 and 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That helped pay for the tanks and missiles used in the invasion. But it also means Russia has strong reasons not to cut off natural gas.
Could Europe survive a gas cutoff?
Europe’s economy would struggle without Russian gas, although the impact would vary based on how much countries use.
Germany, the continent’s largest economy, “is heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies,” said Monika Schnitzer, professor of economics at the University of Munich and member of the country’s government-appointed council of economic experts.
“A suspension of these supplies entails the risk that the German economy slides into a recession with significantly higher inflation rates,” she said.
Inflation is already at record highs, making everything from groceries to raw materials more expensive. It’s driven by soaring energy prices, with Europe facing an energy crunch even before the war broke out.
The crisis has left governments and companies scrambling to round up supplies from other sources, but it would not be enough to cover what’s used now if Russian gas suddenly stopped.
The Bruegel think tank estimated that Europe would be 10% to 15% short of normal demand to get through the next winter heating season, meaning exceptional measures would have to be taken to reduce use.
European leaders have said they can’t afford the consequences of an immediate boycott. Instead, they plan to reduce the use of Russian gas as fast as possible. They’re ordering more liquefied natural gas, which comes by ship; seeking more gas from pipelines from Norway and Azerbaijan; accelerating deployment of wind and solar energy; and pushing conservation measures.
The aim is to cut use of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of the year and completely by 2027.
The situation is serious enough that Germany has declared an early warning of an energy emergency, the first of three stages.

A beleaguered president roaming the streets of a country under attack. Missiles streaming. Sirens wailing. Teens making homemade bombs. And dead soldiers, so many of them, lying crumpled in fields and slumped in smoldering tanks.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spawned a constant stream of online content, a deluge of audio-visuals that has countered Moscow’s disinformation campaign, spurred global leaders to action and helped, as they have in other recent conflicts in Syria and Ethiopia, change the way we see and understand war.
The bombings and violence in cities like Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv feature a cast of newly minted stars — social media standouts who rely on satire, grit and an insider’s sensibilities to document the horrors for a global audience.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has become the most famous and tireless online presence with his riveting daily updates via the instant-messaging platform Telegram. But there are many others, including Illia Ponomarenko, a journalist who has garnered more than 1 million Twitter followers for his play-by-plays of military operations, and Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and a former heavyweight champion boxer who delivers dispatches from the aftermath of bombings.

They offer a quick-pulse stream of consciousness in a morality play where ancient brutality meets raw, digitized immediacy. They are influencers amid the ruins, defiant voices echoing from battlefields and bunkers.
Zelensky’s recent description of the relentless Russian siege of Mariupol as “a crime against humanity ... happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real-time” seized upon what has separated the Ukraine conflict from many past wars: instantaneous documentation.
In February, even as Russia denied it was planning an attack, hints of the coming siege were registered on TikTok, where users posted hundreds of videos showing Russian military vehicles massing along the Ukrainian border.


On Telegram, Twitter and Instagram, Ukrainians have raised money for refugees, organized the exit of civilians from hard-hit regions and chronicled horrors, such as the March 10 bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, where bleeding pregnant women were evacuated on stretchers.

The war in Vietnam was often referred to as the “first television war,” a technological advance from two World Wars decades earlier that had been recorded mostly through printed words and photographs. At the beginning of this century, the conflict in Iraq was still largely filtered to the outside world through journalists and documentary film crews.
The Arab Spring in 2011 was widely seen as the first revolutionary movement launched on social media. But the apps used then to spread uprisings — namely Twitter and Facebook — have evolved significantly in the years since, while new platforms more geared to sharing video have flourished. At the same time, the capabilities of the typical cellphone have expanded to the point where anyone can become an auteur.
Jane Lytvynenko, a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, said social media have played a critical role in shaping the world’s reaction to Russia’s attack.
Instant communication “is having a direct effect on how Western countries are responding to the Feb. 24 invasion, and the reason why it’s having that effect is because regular people en masse are seeing what’s happening,” she said.
She compared the Ukraine war to the Soviet-era artificial famine imposed by Moscow on Ukraine in the 1930s, which killed more than 4 million people. “The facts of the genocidal famine did not get to Western audiences,” she said. “And so Ukraine was left to fend for itself.”

That is not the case today. While separating fact from fiction on social media isn’t always easy, there’s no question that the power and moral clarity of the many voices coming out of a once-peaceful nation of 44 million have made the crisis impossible to avoid. Some critics have argued that the social media feeds of white Europeans trapped in conflict have gained more attention than similar documentation of atrocities coming from Syria or African countries.
The drama of those in turmoil — as it has been since Homer’s “Iliad” — is compelling. Consider Klitschko, the boxer-turned-mayor, and the videos of him touring the sites of deadly strikes. Pacing around a rubble-filled Kyiv street earlier this month, he pointed his cellphone camera at a destroyed apartment building, a bombed-out city bus and the crater where the munition hit. “These images [are] the truth,” he said in English. “That’s what Putin’s war looks like.”

Ponomarenko, a journalist with the Kyiv Independent who has been embedded with Ukrainian forces, has reported on the fighting with a mix of pain and awe. “One, two, three, four Russian tanks taken out,” he said in a recent clip as he panned across the smoking wreckage of militarized vehicles. “I call that a good day.”
On TikTok, young people have amassed huge followings for their simple explanations of what is happening in the war and their documentation of daily life in underground bomb shelters. One recent viral video showed a civilian carefully moving a land mine off a highway, a cigarette hanging from his lips.
Living my best life 🥰🥰🥰 Thanks Russia! #ukraine #stopwar #russiastop
And then there is Zelensky, a former comedic actor elected president in 2019 who is equal parts Jon Stewart and Winston Churchill. He seems to embody the spirit of the nation: exhausted, but still standing, and unrelenting in his demands that the West do more to help Ukraine in what he has framed as a clear choice between good and evil.
His selfie-style videos lend a “social media authenticity that is pretty unimpeachable,” said Eugene Kotlyarenko, a filmmaker who was born in Ukraine.
“We live in an extremely media-sensitive moment where people are very tuned into cues of authenticity,” Kotlyarenko said. “Zelensky seems really earnest and kind of vulnerable but simultaneously strong.”
The president’s dispatches, which he posts every few hours on Telegram, are part of a larger world of Ukrainian content that has helped counter Russia’s widespread disinformation campaign, experts say.
Just like it did in the United States to try to influence the 2016 presidential election, Russia has pushed fake news about its war on Ukraine in an effort to sow confusion.
It has circulated claims that Ukraine is ruled by neo-Nazis and that the U.S. is developing chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine to use against Russian troops. It has charged that the pregnant women bombed at the maternity ward in Mariupol were actually crisis actors. “Very realistic make-up,” the Russian Embassy to the U.K. wrote in a Twitter post that was later deleted.
“They’re creating a few different narratives, and they don’t particularly care which one sticks,” said Lytvynenko. “The goal is to cloud people’s thinking about the war, to make it seem like it’s too complicated for them to understand so that they tune out or change the conversation.”
At home, Russia hasn’t even acknowledged a war is taking place, deeming its military assault on Ukraine a “special operation,” and threatening anybody who says otherwise with prison.
The adage that truth is the first casualty of war is also playing out on many platforms across cyberspace.
In the war’s early days, Facebook Gaming featured videos presented as live footage of attacks on Ukraine that turned out to be from a military video game. On TikTok, many accounts featured an audio clip of Ukrainian soldiers cursing at a Russian warship that has asked them to surrender — with text saying the soldiers had died. They lived.
“It is difficult — even for seasoned journalists and researchers — to discern truth from rumor, parody and fabrication,” according to a report from Harvard researchers who studied TikTok’s impact on the war.
In #Berdyansk, a man removed a mine from under a bridge. pic.twitter.com/ZrBy1pqC0w
Aware of such manipulation, the Biden administration recently invited several prominent TikTok producers to a briefing on the war, in hopes that they would help push accurate information. “We recognize this is a critically important avenue in the way the American public is finding out about the latest, so we wanted to make sure you had the latest information from an authoritative source,” one official said, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by the Washington Post.
But disinformation continues to spread.
A few weeks ago, a manipulated video circulated in which Zelensky appeared to ask his soldiers to lay down their arms. Zelensky quickly took to Telegram to denounce it. A few days later, a different fake video popped up, in which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced peace with Ukraine.
The war, of course, carried on, both on the battlefield and online.

Hello, it’s Thursday, April 14, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Accusing Russia of ‘genocide’, Biden will send more military aid to Ukraine
President Biden and other Western leaders pledged additional military aid for Ukraine, while Russia sharply rejected the president’s description of its wartime acts as “genocide.”
After an hourlong call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden announced his administration was authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition and other security assistance to Ukraine.
Biden said the new military aid “will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”

Is L.A. witnessing the end of the ‘Latino paradox’?

For years, public health experts have observed how Latinos have overall better mortality rates than white residents, despite being more likely to have lower incomes, chronic health issues and decreased access to healthcare. Now, the  COVID-19 pandemic has upended the so-called Latino paradox in Los Angeles County.
For the first time in the last decade, the mortality rate for Latinos in Los Angeles County became worse than that of white residents, starting in 2020 and worsening the next year. Latinos also suffered the highest percentage increase in death rates for all reasons among the four racial and ethnic groups analyzed by L.A. County between 2019 and 2021.
The mortality rate for Latino residents in L.A. County rose  48% over that period, growing from a rate of 511 deaths for every 100,000 Latino residents to a rate of 756. The increase in Latinos’ death rate was double the increase in the death rate for all L.A. County residents, which rose  23%.

Newsom and lawmakers haggle over a plan for relief from high gas prices
More than a month after Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged to give Californians money to offset rising gas prices, he and state lawmakers have yet to find common ground on the most basic details of the plan: Who should be eligible for refunds and how much should they receive?
Gas prices in the state are beginning to drop, but the $5.73 average price of a gallon of regular unleaded fuel remains $1.79 higher than what Californians paid one year ago and $1.65 above the current national average.
With higher transportation costs increasing the price of food and other goods, state leaders hope to reach an agreement soon. Yet little progress had been made by the time the Legislature broke for its spring recess last week.

Villanueva threatens to quit Metro security if not given full control
Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva threatened that his department would quit patrolling Metro’s transit system unless the agency’s board gives him full control over security. Villanueva made the demand as the current contract is set to expire this summer. The LAPD patrols a majority of the transit system, 325 sheriff’s deputies are responsible for about a third of it, and Long Beach police handle a tiny fraction.
Villanueva and other sheriff’s officials said the Sheriff’s Department will submit to Metro a proposal for about 600 deputies to patrol the transit system for $30 million less annually than what they currently pay for the same level of staffing.
How Villanueva would be able to do that without badly depleting other areas of his department is unclear. The sheriff has blamed a hiring freeze imposed by the Board of Supervisors for leaving him with almost 1,000 vacancies across his department.
‘Ashamed’ Sherri Papini takes a plea deal and admits to a fake kidnapping scheme
Sherri Papini, who was arrested and charged in federal court last month for faking her 2016 kidnapping, accepted a plea deal and admitted to the scheme, federal prosecutors said.
“I am deeply ashamed of myself for my behavior and so sorry for the pain I’ve caused my family, my friends, all the good people who needlessly suffered because of my story and those who worked so hard to try to help me,” Papini said in a statement.
Papini, 39, went missing after reportedly going for a run in her Mountain Gate neighborhood. The disappearance drew national and international attention, with Papini’s husband appearing on “Good Morning America.” A GoFundMe to support the family raised nearly $50,000.

Police arrested a man in the Brooklyn subway attack. A man who posted numerous social media videos decrying the U.S. as a racist place awash in violence and recounting his struggle with mental illness was arrested a day after an attack on a subway train in Brooklyn injured 10 people. Frank R. James was charged with a federal terrorism offense.
Frustration is growing over truck backlogs at the Texas-Mexico border. The gridlock is the fallout of an initiative that Texas Gov.

The two-term Republican said Wednesday he was ending inspections at one international bridge, but he would not rescind his new order at all bridges until he gets more assurances of security.

L.A. loves to gawk at and fight about extravagant real estate. For almost 150 years, it’s been Angelenos’ universal Topic A. Buying it, selling it, looking at it, yearning over it — a pastime, a hobby, and a preoccupation, and everyone has a story to tell. It’s a genre in reality TV. It was the founding impetus for our once-vast streetcar system, built at the outset not to carry people to where they wanted to go, but to where its real estate mogul-creator wanted them to go to buy his property.
There are places in the country and in the state where “million-dollar house” still sounds like a lottery-ticket fever dream, but L.A. isn’t one of them. Still, it took years for the market to get as extravagant as is today, writes columnist Patt Morrison.

One hundred and sixty-two years ago today, the first Pony Express arrived in San Francisco. The Chronicle reported in 2017 about the historic service to a city that in 1860 was “the end of the West, a region that was remote and almost mythical to most Americans.” The Pony Express famously lasted only a year and a half and ran up huge debts, but it succeeded in delivering mail at a then-breakneck pace of 10 days from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento. (The final leg of the journey was by boat.)
In Southern California, the mail service was celebrated by W. Parker Lyon with his Pony Express Museum, which The Times said in a 1929 report was “chock full of California antiques from the gold-rush days.” The paraphernalia, according to the story, included a pair of handcuffs that one visiting schoolboy got clamped around his wrists: “Let this be a warning to all small boys with taking ways: A South Pasadena schoolboy whose name doesn’t matter, is in the Pasadena police station tonight trying to keep a stiff upper lip while burly policemen are using might and mainly an acetylene torch to free his fragile wrists from the torturing pressure of a pair of rusty, fifty-year-old handcuffs.”
The boy was freed. The museum and its Pony Express history moved to Arcadia in 1935, where it had a 20-year run before closing.

It’s Wednesday, March 2. I’m Justin Ray.
Russia’s attack on Ukraine has led to many sad updates. But I’m here to tell you a story about a couple who made it safely back to their Costa Mesa home after traveling to Ukraine to pick up their new baby daughter by a Ukrainian surrogate mother.
Reporter Cindy Carcamo recently explained how Jessie and Jacob Boeckmann made a perilous escape to the Ukrainian-Polish border in 30-degree weather. Every 10 to 20 minutes, the couple checked to make sure that Vivian, their days-old infant, was warm enough and still breathing. At the time, the couple constantly questioned whether they made the right decision.
“What have I done to my sweet angel?” Jessie, an ophthalmologist, thought to herself. “This could be the worst decision I’ve ever made.”
It was a tricky situation from the  beginning. After waking up to the sound of explosions Thursday morning, as Russian forces launched their invasion, the couple decided they had to leave immediately.
The outbound trip became a 27-hour ordeal. The story explains how the escape was difficult due to the scores of Ukrainian refugees and foreigners who had similar plans to flee. The journey was further complicated by the fact that the couple had to keep a close eye on their  child as they faced the bitter cold.
Perhaps the most harrowing moment took place when they got to the border.
“It was chaos. There wasn’t a line, only three Ukrainian border guards with machine guns. Men pushed. Children cried. Women screamed,” Carcamo writes. “Vivian started to cry. She was hungry. But the bag with the baby formula and water bottles were with Jacob, on the other side of the barbed wire.”
Here are some other recent stories we’ve published about the turmoil:

The Times’ Lorraine Ali calls out a grim bias in Western media coverage. When columnists and TV correspondents express shock at European conflict, they reveal a damning belief that war is acceptable elsewhere, she writes.

Nearly 200 Rocklin Unified School District educators called in sick or took leave Monday, protesting the district’s defiance of state-imposed K-12 mask mandates. “While there are varying opinions on masking in our community and our schools, the issue teachers are most concerned about is the lack of respect for educators blatantly displayed by the RUSD Board of Trustees in making this change,” the Rocklin Teachers Professional Assn. said in a statement. Although Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new rules on classroom masking would seem to settle the disagreement, teachers remain frustrated that the district’s decision was made in a closed session instead of a public meeting.

Today’s California memory is from Paul De Anda:
In March of 1979, my older brother Ronnie and I were returning home, to Somerton, Ariz., from Anaheim.  Somerton is a small farming community that abuts Mexico and California and Ronnie would visit his soon-to-be wife in Anaheim every two weeks. He would milk the visit to its last moment, and we would start our return visit to Somerton around 11 p.m., knowing that we would arrive home just in time to change into our work clothes. We connected to Interstate 10 going south toward Indio when the song “Heart of Glass” by Blondie started playing on the radio. It was a sound that was extremely unique and unlike anything I had heard before. To this day, I link the smell of the salt cedar trees that line the railroad tracks and California with this uniqueness.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-04/the-return-of-nuclear-anxiety-gen-x-and-older-remember-that;2022-03-04;New nuclear anxieties triggered by Russia-Ukraine war - Los Angeles Times;"Growing up in Las Vegas in the 1980s, Glynn Walker always knew he could die in a nuclear attack.
The 43-year-old engineer remembers “duck and cover” drills in elementary school, where you dive under your desk in the event of an air raid, and basement fallout shelters in churches and gymnasiums with radiation-warning signs on their doors.
“We had the nuclear test sites, Nellis Air Force Base, the Hoover Dam,” he said, referring to Nevada landmarks that likely were in the crosshairs of Soviet military strategists. “We knew we’d be a target,” he said.
The prospect of nuclear war also permeated popular culture at the time, as it had done during the initial nuclear era of the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s. Movies like “WarGames,” “Red Dawn” and “The Day After” played on TV. Pro-wrestling hero Hulk Hogan battled the villainous Russian  Nikolai Volkoff right after Saturday morning cartoons. “99 Luftballoons,” a pop song about an accidentally triggered Armageddon, by the German new wave band Nena, was a radio hit in the early 1980s.
“I can remember riding my bike through the desert as a kid and thinking one day this whole valley will be a radioactive hole,” Walker said. “I didn’t panic about it. It was just the way it was.”
As the years passed, Walker stopped worrying about nuclear bombs as other threats emerged: terrorism, the war in Iraq, climate change. But the old anxieties came flooding back last week as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a massive military invasion of Ukraine, while warning potential foes who intervened of “consequences greater than any you have ever faced in history,” and putting his nuclear forces on high alert.
Walker doesn’t think nuclear war over Ukraine is likely. “My hope is there are some guardrails or he’s playing chicken,” he said of Russia’s pugilist-in-chief.
World & Nation
Firefighters extinguished the fire at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and there has been no release of radioactive material, authorities say.

And yet, like other Americans, some for the first time in years, he’s found himself fantasizing about what would happen if a nuclear bomb went off near his home in the Atlanta suburbs, several miles from the nearest city.

“This time I’m thinking I won’t be eviscerated, instead I’ll be left to slowly die of radiation poisoning,” he said.
That brings him no comfort.
“I don’t want to watch my children die and I don’t want to let them see me die either,” he said.
Experts say that Putin has little to gain from starting a nuclear war, but his recent rhetoric has stirred up long-buried fears in generations of Americans who grew up believing nuclear annihilation was not just possible, but practically inevitable.
World & Nation
Putin puts nuclear forces on high alert, but is there reason to worry?

“All it took was one guy basically saying, ‘OK, I’m putting my guys on nuclear alert,’ and all of a sudden all the movies in our head are back,’” said David Greenwald, a psychologist and author of the 1987 book “No Reason to Talk About It: Families Confront the Nuclear Taboo.” Putin “brought this stuff out of the closet.”
Nuclear anxiety has been part of the American psyche since the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. What before had seemed like science fiction suddenly became reality: Humanity was armed with the power to destroy civilization.
Children, struggling to process what most grown-ups could barely comprehend, let alone deal with psychologically, were especially impacted.
“There was a lot of research that showed the youth at that time experienced deep fear and anxiety that adults could no longer protect them from adult things,” said Spencer Weart, a science historian and author of “The Rise of Nuclear Fear.” “People who joined the counterculture in the ’60s will tell you it was ‘duck and cover’ and hiding from ‘the bomb’ that convinced them we had to change the system.”
The fear came in waves, peaking in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis and again in the early 1980s because both Soviet and U.S leadership seemed unpredictable, if not bent on confrontation. But even as global warming supplanted atomic Armageddon as the most likely destroyer of civilizations, the threat of nuclear war never went away entirely.
“It receded from the public imagination in part because there were other problems that came to the fore, but we still live in a world of nuclear weapons,” said Francesca Giovanni, executive director of the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard. “It’s always been in the background.”

Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

For many adults who’ve lived their entire lives in the shadow of “the Bomb,” the sense of deja vu is palpable.
As a child in New York City in the 1960s, Victor Narro remembers feeling comforted whenever he saw a sign indicating a fallout shelter — three yellow triangles in a black circle. “As a kid I held that image as a sacred image of safety,” he said. “That was the indoctrination.”
His family immigrated from Peru to New York City in the ’60s, when he was 4 years old. When he started kindergarten the following year his teachers told him the city would likely be the first target in a nuclear war — that’s why his class had to do so many drills.

With the world on edge, experts urge parents to check in with their children of all ages, but not to worry if those conversations are brief.

“They were always leading us to different parts of the playground,” he said.
In college, Narro became a student activist and put a lot energy into trying to dismantle the arms race. But the work felt hopeless to him and he came to believe he would not make it out of the 1980s alive. He relied on his Catholic faith to help him cope. “I remember praying a lot,” he said.
The end of Ronald Reagan’s presidency brought Narro some relief, as did the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991.
“By the early 1990s, I started feeling like it was behind me,” he said. “I knew there would always be nuclear weapons, but the end of the Cold War felt like the end of the policy of destruction from both sides to maintain peace.”
This last week however, the old feelings of fear and hopelessness resurfaced.
When Putin started talking about nuclear weapons, Narro posted a fallout shelter sign to social media. “I was like, ‘Is anyone feeling this?’” he said. “I wanted to re-create that space of safety.”
For Kim Lachance Shandrow, 46, a freelance journalist in Long Beach, the week’s events brought back memories of a particularly frightening music video from the 1980s, Genesis’ “Land of Confusion.”
“I didn’t see any of the nuclear war movies, but I watched MTV like a maniac and recorded videos as if they would never be shown again,” she said.

Lachance Shandrow wasn’t a huge Genesis fan, but “Land of Confusion” was one of the videos she taped and watched over and over again. It stars a creepy Ronald Reagan puppet in the midst of a fever dream. In the final moments of the video, he reaches out from a brass bed to call a nurse to bring him a glass of water. Instead of pressing the red button marked “Nurse,” he pushes the one just above it marked “Nuke.” The video ends with a fiery mushroom cloud.
“We were painfully aware that could happen anytime, anywhere,” she said.
The video was released in 1986, the same year that Lachance Shandrow remembers visiting the Trump Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., with her family. Her parents left her and her sister in the hotel room while they went downstairs to drink and gamble. It was April 26, the day the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union) exploded, and Lachance Shandrow and her sister watched the news all day long.
“I was 11 and that was the period in my life when I started to question Catholicism and my Catholic school experience,” Lachance Shandrow said. “The Genesis video was a big video for me, and Chernobyl was life-changing.”
Memories of the Chernobyl disaster were kindled early Friday, when a fire broke out at Ukraine’s gigantic Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex amid the fighting, and it was seized by Russian forces.
While pop culture has extracted some catharsis from our nuclear anxieties over the decades — Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb” (1964) is a masterpiece of fission-reaction gallows humor — a handful of books have tried to warn about the possible fate of the earth if humankind isn’t careful.
The last chapter of planetary scientist Carl Sagan’s best-selling classic “Cosmos,” published in 1980, is a plea to the people of Earth to wake up to the danger of nuclear weapons.
“From an extraterrestrial perspective, our global civilization is clearly on the edge of failure in the most important task it faces,” he wrote. “To preserve the lives and well-being of the citizens of the planet.”

Over the next decade, he and his wife, “Cosmos” co-author Ann Druyan, led protests at nuclear test sites in Nevada, where they were arrested several times.
Over time, they felt they were successful in helping to bring public attention to the cause of de-escalation and disarmament. The number of nuclear warheads in the world had been reduced by 40,000 from the height of the Cold War to the end of the Obama administration.
“Someone was listening,” Druyan said in an interview this week from her home in Ithaca, N.Y.
In the 1990s, the couple turned their attention to climate change, which appeared to be moving faster than earlier models had predicted.
Druyan said she understood the shock that so many felt when Putin put the world back on nuclear notice.
“Here we are in a situation we have not been thinking about because we had other fish to fry,” she said. “When we look at the destruction of the entire Earth, we were thinking the feedback mechanism speeding up was the most urgent problem, and suddenly the subject has been changed.”
Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state.
A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.”
There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-22/explainer-us-boosting-supply-heavy-arms-ukraine;2022-04-22;Explainer: Why Washington is boosting heavy arms for Ukraine - Los Angeles Times;"Eight weeks into Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Biden administration’s decision to dramatically ramp up delivery of artillery guns to Kyiv signals a deepening American commitment at a pivotal stage of fighting in Ukraine’s industrial heartland.
It also brings into stark relief Moscow’s warning that continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine would have “unpredictable” consequences, suggesting that Russia sees the international wave of weaponry as a growing challenge to its war effort as well as a Western provocation.
“We’re in a critical window” of time now, President Biden said Thursday in announcing his approval of an additional $800 million in battlefield aid that includes 72 of the U.S. Army’s 155mm howitzers, along with 144,000 artillery rounds and more than 120 armed drones that will require training for Ukrainian operators.
This brings to $3.4 billion the amount of security assistance provided since Russia began its invasion Feb. 24. That is an extraordinary total of U.S. military aid for a country to which the United States has no defense-treaty obligation.
A look at the U.S. assistance and expectations for what it will accomplish:

Heavy weapons such as artillery are shaping up as a key feature of the unfolding battle for Ukraine’s eastern region known as the Donbas. The relatively flat terrain is suited for what the military calls maneuver warfare — the movement of tanks and other ground forces backed by long-range guns like the 155mm howitzer.
The Russians have been deploying their own additional artillery to the Donbas region in recent days, along with more ground troops and other materiel to support and sustain what could be a long fight for terrain in Ukraine’s industrial heartland.
World & Nation

The howitzers the U.S. is sending to Ukraine will be the latest American model, known as the M777, used by the Army and the Marine Corps. Smaller and more maneuverable than the older model, the M777 can be deployed on the battlefield by heavy-lift helicopters and moved relatively quickly between positions by 7-ton trucks that also are being provided by the Pentagon.
“What makes it important is the kind of fighting that we expect in the Donbas. Because of the terrain, because it’s open, because it’s flat, because it’s not as urban, we can expect the Russians to rely on long-range fires — artillery in particular,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. “So we know that this is going to be part of the Russians’ playbook.”
A senior U.S. defense official said the first of the 72 howitzers are expected to begin moving to Europe by this weekend. Of 18 other 155mm howitzers that Biden approved last week for shipment to Ukraine, an unspecified number already are in Europe, and U.S. howitzer training for Ukrainian personnel began Wednesday in an undisclosed country outside of Ukraine.

Probably not, and Biden said he already has asked the Pentagon to get to work on additional potential military assistance.
Biden said this phase of Russia’s invasion would be “more limited in terms of geography but not in terms of brutality.” He also acknowledged that he needs Congress to approve the funds necessary to continue providing key weapons to Ukraine beyond the latest $800-million package, which he said would ensure a steady flow of arms only for the next few weeks.
World & Nation
It has been more than a month since Russian troops advanced on Rubizhne, a small, well-appointed city nestled in a verdant slice of land. Families have taken refuge in a bombed cultural palace.


U.S. officials say the Russians are trying to adjust their approach in Ukraine after early setbacks, suggesting the fight could be a long one.
After failing to take Kyiv, the capital, in the early weeks of its multipronged invasion, Russia has since narrowed its objectives by focusing on the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014, and on a stretch of coastal territory along the Sea of Azov from Mariupol to the Crimean peninsula. One Russian advantage is this region’s proximity to Russian territory, which allows for shorter supply lines than earlier battles in Ukraine’s north.
In addition to the 72 howitzers and the vehicles required to move them around the battlefield, the new weapons package for Ukraine includes artillery rounds and armed drones from U.S. Air Force stocks. Still in the pipeline from a separate $800-million weapons package announced only last week is a wide range of articles, including radars used to enable the targeting of Russian artillery, as well as air-surveillance radars and unmanned coastal drone vessels.
“Artillery and drones are the exact things Ukraine will need as Russia heads into its next campaign in the east and south,” said Mark Montgomery, a retired Navy rear admiral who previously served with U.S. European Command in helping improve U.S.-Ukrainian military relations. Montgomery is now an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

The drone included in the latest package is called the Phoenix Ghost, made by a U.S. company, Aevex Aerospace, which bills itself as a leader in “full-spectrum airborne intelligence solutions.” Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, declined to describe the drone’s capabilities beyond saying that it is used “largely but not exclusively to attack targets.” It also has onboard cameras.
Kirby said the drones are especially well-suited to the terrain on which the Ukrainians are fighting in the Donbas."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-26/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-invasion-george-washington-vladimir-putin;2022-02-26;Op-Ed: Is Zelensky Ukraine's George Washington? - Los Angeles Times;"Over the last 30 years, many Ukrainians have asked when their nation will finally get its George Washington, a leader who can rally the people and lead it to victory.
I’ve usually told Ukrainian interlocutors that Washington wasn’t born a great man; he became one because of the trials of the Revolutionary War, when he demonstrated his ability to lead and to symbolize the American struggle. A Ukrainian Washington might emerge in a similar manner, and now perhaps he has.
Ukrainians’ question may have been answered by an unlikely candidate for the hero role: Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian-turned-president, who many analysts — including me — considered would be disastrous for the country. He was elected in a landslide in 2019, and, like most Ukrainian presidents, proceeded to introduce some important reforms before getting bogged down by red tape, internecine power struggles, his own lack of experience — which many Ukrainians called incompetence — and the COVID-19 crisis.
World & Nation
Ukrainian forces and armed volunteers fought fiercely to maintain control of Kyiv against Russian troops as explosions and gunfire shook the city.

Then, to make things worse, in mid-2021 Zelensky was confronted with a massive Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. He downplayed it for months — thereby provoking even more criticism of his administration — until it became clear a few weeks ago that Russia’s strongman president, Vladimir Putin, had set his sights on invading Ukraine.
Since then, and especially since Putin officially announced his aggressive intentions and the invasion began, Zelensky has discovered his backbone and acted admirably, even heroically, rallying the nation around the flag, organizing the homeland defense, lobbying foreign countries for support, calming the population with well-delivered patriotic speeches, appealing to Russians to end the madness, and demonstrating that he has no intention of fleeing.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said he will remain in Kyiv, even as Russia pounded the capital and other cities with airstrikes for a second day.
Zelensky’s defiant speeches and selfie videos, shot on the streets of Kyiv, have gone viral. “We are here,” he said calmly into a cellphone camera on Friday, standing with his top advisors. “We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine.”

The message was clear: He would defend Ukrainian sovereignty and statehood to the very end. Even his most severe critics have been silenced, impressed by Zelensky’s bravery and commitment.
A few days after Putin’s invasion, the Warsaw-based Jan Karski Society (named after the heroic Polish underground courier who informed the West of the atrocities being perpetrated against Jews in the Warsaw ghetto) honored Zelensky with the Jan Karski Eagle Award for his “heroic defense of Ukraine and the moral values of Western civilization.” As one member of the awards committee, Rabbi Abraham Skórka, said: “Let us take heed that the sin of omission toward Ukraine and the brave nation does not come to persecute us, like the sin of omission in the face of the Holocaust.”
By implicitly comparing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to the Holocaust, Skórka was suggesting that the Russian dictator was following in Hitler’s footsteps, that his aggression was tantamount to genocide, and that Zelensky — who himself is of Jewish background — was acting in the manner of those heroic individuals who resisted the Nazis.
The fact that Zelensky is a Russian-speaking Ukrainian Jew is of immense symbolic as well as political importance. In his past life, he was not particularly political. His comedy poked fun at patriotic Ukrainians, and he did not appear to pay much attention to the way he personifies three identities. But all that has changed in the last few days and weeks.
Politics
The U.S. says it is providing an additional $350 million in military aid to the Ukrainian government as the country’s forces try to fend off Russia.

Zelensky identifies fully with Ukraine, but this Ukraine is expansive, diverse, tolerant and committed to freedom and democracy. No less important: This Ukraine — which Putin obscenely claims has to be de-Nazified — has also been embraced by the vast majority of Ukraine’s inhabitants, regardless of their language preference, religion or ethnic background. Indeed, some of the most striking dispatches from the ongoing war feature Russian-speaking Ukrainians defending their freedoms and cursing Putin.
The war for Ukraine is far from over, and Zelensky may yet stumble and lose his aura. In any case, he will go down in history as a new type of Ukrainian patriot who fought for his homeland’s freedom. And in the end, he may deserve to be considered Ukraine’s George Washington.

Will it be enough? - Los Angeles Times;"With a war many thought would be over in days bogging down into a protracted conflict, the U.S. and its NATO allies are recalibrating their response, scaling up defense aid for Ukraine as it digs in for a longer fight with Russian forces.
But even as President Biden has vowed not to let Russia win, it’s not at all clear an enhanced response will help Ukraine win the war or avoid a years-long conflict that is likely to strain the transatlantic alliance, cost billions in additional aid, further disrupt global economic markets and lead to more bloodshed on the front lines.
“It’s going to be a different kind of war, and there has to be a greater urgency,” said Eric Edelman, a former undersecretary of defense. “If Russia isn’t successful right away, Ukraine might still hold a strategic advantage in the long term. But that depends on how long they can absorb casualties and maintain a will to fight, and how long the West can keep this up.”
As part of Washington’s continuing efforts to bolster Ukraine’s war-fighting capabilities, Biden announced Tuesday a new tranche of $800 million in defense assistance for Kyiv. It includes advanced weapons and ammunition including artillery systems, armored personnel carriers and the transfer of more helicopters to help Ukraine blunt Moscow’s latest offensive in the eastern Donbas region and the besieged city of Mariupol.
The announcement, following an hour-long call between Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, came as the White House is facing pressure to take stronger actions as the war stretches into its eighth week.
Although the latest aid package increases the U.S. commitment to what administration officials have conceded could be a years-long conflict, the White House remains wary of greater U.S. involvement that might change the trajectory and length of the war — even as Biden has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” and characterized the Russian campaign as “genocide.”
Such presidential rhetoric — which went beyond official White House policy — raises the stakes for U.S. and NATO involvement, according to Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
“The president needs to signal that we will do whatever it takes for Ukraine to succeed because you can’t call people out for war crimes, let alone genocide, and not do everything possible,” said Daalder, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration.

“The more ratcheted up the rhetoric,” he added, “the more incumbent it comes on us to actually fulfill what that means.”
Since Russia’s invasion in February, the White House has tried to strike a balance between backing Ukraine and avoiding direct and potentially escalatory engagement with a nuclear power that could turn a regional war into a global one. Biden has made clear he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a no-fly zone, steps officials say could bring the U.S. into conflict with Moscow. So far, the White House has focused on bolstering the NATO alliance, punishing the Kremlin with sanctions and supplying Ukrainians with weapons and intelligence.
The Department of Defense said last week it had delivered thousands of antiarmor and antiaircraft systems, including Stinger and Javelin missiles, laser-guided rocket systems and more than 50 million rounds of ammunition as part of two packages of security assistance the president approved in March.
The latest package expands on the $1.7 billion in security assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24 and the $2.4 billion in aid since Biden took office.
It’s unclear if, or how, the West might send more powerful weapons, such as U.S. military jets and Apache helicopters, that it’s thus far avoided.
The Biden administration has resisted such transfers for logistical reasons — the U.S. would not only have to train Ukraine’s military how to operate, say, an F-16, but also establish supply lines and infrastructure to maintain such equipment. U.S. officials believe that would take too long to be helpful.

World & Nation
Russia’s flagship in the Black Sea has suffered ‘significant damage’ as Ukraine said it attacked the vessel with a shore-to-ship missile.

Ukrainians, meanwhile, are pleading for Washington to ship them advanced arms as they are urging U.S. officials to consider the geopolitical realities of a protracted fight.
“Russia will be here forever as a neighbor of Ukraine,” said Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center. “We need to get prepared for a sustainable solution with advanced NATO-style weapons.”
Kaleniuk and a delegation of Ukrainian civil society advocates and former government officials met with dozens of U.S. lawmakers last week, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and officials from the State Department  and White House.
“There’s still some fear about being too provocative to Russia. There’s fear of nuclear weapons,” she said following her White House meeting. “But deterrence works both ways and Putin uses deterrence.”
Experts have applauded the White House’s efforts to assist Ukraine but say the Biden administration and its allies took too long to act, complicating Ukraine’s ability to fend off the invasion.
“They were always slow and way too cautious about actually implementing it,” said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. “They repeatedly refused to take steps in fear of provoking Putin.”
Pressed about whether aid is arriving too late as Russia shifts its focus to an eastern offensive, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday that “we are going to move this as fast as we can,” arguing the assistance the U.S. has already sent is playing a role in Ukraine’s defense.
“We’re aware of the clock and we know time is not our friend,” Kirby told reporters.
World & Nation
The big battle for eastern Ukraine is coming, but in the south, Ukrainian soldiers have pushed back the front lines of Russian forces.

Daalder, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said the administration’s challenge on timing is in whether it can quickly acquire the equipment and weapons that Ukrainians are trained to use. Much of it was manufactured by Russia or in countries that were once part of the Soviet Union (Ukraine was a Soviet republic).
“The delay is not really what is the U.S. providing,” Daadler said. “It’s: How do you get the equipment that’s among the former Warsaw Pact countries rapidly to Ukraine and what do you do to backfill those capabilities in order to make sure that NATO is still defended?”
Biden last week announced the U.S. repositioned a Patriot missile system to Slovakia, which borders Ukraine, to backfill its transfer of a Soviet-era S-300 defense system to Kyiv to fend off airstrikes. But in March the administration rejected a three-way deal to transfer MiG 29 fighter jets from Poland, a NATO member and regarded as a former Soviet satellite, to Ukraine after deeming it too “high risk.”
Despite such fissures, NATO has remained mostly unified even if members’ interests aren’t always aligned. Major gulfs could emerge as the conflict drags on, however.
Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has waffled on cutting off imports of Russian oil and gas due to recession fears; the country’s coalition government is split on whether to send German-made tanks to Kyiv.
If far-right candidate and Putin ally Marine Le Pen ousts French President Emmanuel Macron in a run-off election later this month, it would immediately puncture NATO’s newfound solidarity. That unity may deepen this summer if Finland and Sweden end decades of neutrality and join the alliance, as is expected. But even if bonds among democratic leaders hold, the threat of Putin in Ukraine and to the rest of Europe could only grow.
Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at Washington’s Brookings Institution, said NATO’s response to Putin in Ukraine has been “the most considered, forceful and effective Western response to any crisis that I’ve seen. But events on the ground may still show that what we’re doing is not enough, because Putin is clearly determined to test us. And we may have to change our definition of what we can do.”
Politics
The U.S. almost certainly will have to play a big role in providing security guarantees and aid to a postwar Ukraine.

As the  grisly nature of past Russian atrocities is uncovered and as Ukrainian losses mount during what’s expected to be heavy fighting in the Donbas, the political pressure for the West to do more is likely to grow. But the cold, hard reality, many experts believe, is that the war quickly becomes a frozen conflict.
“Putin is not going to capitulate,” said Ian Bremmer, president of  the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm. “The reason why the administration believes this is likely to be a stalemate is that, in some ways, that is the least worst plausible outcome that we are headed towards.”
Dan Baer, former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe during the Obama administration, said that “the scenarios by which it ends tomorrow are not necessarily ones that are satisfactory for the long-term stability of the region or the world.”
“If it’s going to be protracted, what you want is a slower and lower burn so there’s less human cost. Because faster could mean  Ukrainian defeat,” he said. “Of course I don’t want it to drag out, but if you take all of the possibilities for a fast [resolution], there are fewer of them that look good for the Ukrainians.”
“This is a Russian novel and we’re in Chapter 3, and the bad news is that there are 57 chapters,” he added."

“When it’s good weather the Russians can correct their targeting with the drones,” said Nesquik, a 26-year-old with the smooth face of a boy whose nickname comes from a chocolate drink. “Today, they’re just shooting where they think the targets are — they have artillery to spare.”
The thud of explosions rumbled somewhere in the distance.
You hear little else in Posad Pokrovske, a farming hamlet in southern Ukraine transformed into a tableau of destruction: Houses with gap-toothed roofs or entire wings gutted by artillery. A starving pig trotting down a crater-riddled street searching for food. The side of the village school slashed open by a blast, spilling concrete blocks and schoolbooks into the playground. And silence.
In the almost seven weeks since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade, Ukrainian troops have pushed back the front line in the south from the edge of Mykolaiv, a vital port nearly 70 miles northeast of the Black Sea city of Odesa, to the southeast toward Kherson, the first and — so far — only major city occupied by the Russians.
That drew the fight out of the dense urban areas and onto the plains astride the M14 highway, leaving wheat fields littered with the spent tubes of Smerch cluster rockets and antitank weapons. Farming villages with birch-lined streets and quaint cottages became sites of clashes of men and armor.
Posad Pokrovske, which lies almost exactly equidistant between Mykolaiv and Kherson, is the last point under Ukrainian control. Russian troops are less than a mile away on the village edge, but they were inside until March 13, when Nesquik’s group, which had mobilized from Odesa and was tasked with liberating a string of villages in the area, entered Posad Pokrovske and surprised them.
“They didn’t expect to see us here, but when they did, they came at us with technicals, tanks, artillery, infantry,” he said, nodding at a row of half-destroyed buildings down the street.

“Most of the damage you see is from that day.”
Since then, the fight in the village has become a game of hide-and-seek-then-kill, each side struggling to find an opening and drive the other back. But with Moscow reorienting its forces to focus on Ukraine’s Donbas region, the battle is set to change again: Rather than aiming for Odesa, Russian troops are hunkering down to secure their rear while they push toward the east in what may become the bloodiest campaign of the war.
“They’re not attacking. Instead, we’re seeing the Russians now build defenses, and we’re trying not to let them do this,” Nesquik said. “They understand that with the Dnieper River behind them in Kherson, they have nowhere to go. If they’re pushed out, they won’t be able to come back.”
Such is the hope of a young man with a gun and a country to save. Skirmishes have been replaced by artillery duels between the two sides, slowly denuding life from the territory one barrage at a time.
Posad Pokrovske once had some 2,300 residents; none remain. Over in Shevchenkove, a sleepy village four miles up the road toward Mykolaiv, more than two-thirds of the people have disappeared, said Father Pavlo, the priest presiding over St. John Church. That figure feels like a large underestimate.
With gilt-framed portraits of Jesus, Mary and St. Joseph looking down on him, Father Pavlo, a soft-spoken man in his late 40s with blue eyes and a pony tail, sighed and gave a wry smile when asked about the state of his parish.
“We have five different denominations in the village. This is an Orthodox church, but right now, we’re like a big family,” he said.
Around him were stacked boxes of rice, muesli, cookies, crackers and black pouches of something called “Coconutty Curry.” By way of explanation, he pointed at the boxes, saying that the church had become in effect a community assistance center.
“We started collecting donations from friends, from the Mykolaiv government. We have people with their cars delivering assistance, evacuating people,” he said. Those with houses still intact were hosting those whose homes had been damaged in the fighting, he added.
“We also try to help the injured, or take the dead.”
There had been no lack of both in recent days. A few hours earlier on Monday, a shell injured one man, and the evening before an artillery round killed another resident. Two were killed the day before that. Earlier in the war, the head of the local council was killed, local media reported, and the mayor was kidnapped by the Russians last month when he went to deliver aid to other villages. He’s thought to be held somewhere in Crimea. Then four days ago, a barrage snapped through some of the power lines, knocking out electricity and forcing whoever remained here to rely on generators.
Those events had joined a lengthening litany of afflictions and mourning for the dead. Asked about those who still remained, Father Pavlo’s eyes turned a shiny red and his lips quivered. He turned and walked away. He looked at a painting of one of the saints until he regained his composure.
“For 10 years I’ve tried to build the church,” he said. “It’s hard, of course. Now I’m happy when people leave to a safe area. I’m upset if someone returns because it’s too dangerous.”
Those still here, he said, “have no choice but to stay,” immobilized either because of ill health, old age or taking care of someone.
One of those in the last category was Natalya Steblina, 41, a surprisingly jovial woman who stayed with her 82-year-old mother, two grandsons, a dog and a cat.
“Yes, I’m afraid, but what can I do? I hope it will be OK. I don’t want to leave. My grandsons, my mom, none of them want to leave. So we help each other,” she said. The cat rubbed against her leg (she wore shorts despite the cold) as explosions thundered somewhere over the horizon.
“When they want, they do that,” she said, cocking her ear at the sound of the barrage.
“Day, night, any time.”
Yet even in the relative safety of Mykolaiv, some 12 miles to the northeast, there is still fear. An industrial yet elegant ship-building hub on the confluence of two rivers, the city has regained some of its daily rhythms.
The weekend saw brisk pedestrian traffic on its avenues and riverfront boulevards, with people enjoying a sunny day and shrugging off the morbid thoughts of the first weeks of war. Many crowded into liquor stores (they only open on weekends) to load up. But night brought the familiar drumbeat of explosions once again, including a blast that sent windows across the city rattling and pushed Vitaliy Kim, Mykolaiv’s pugnacious regional governor, to issue a video the next day reassuring residents.
Meanwhile, for any who believe Mykolaiv is clear of danger, the wreckage of the regional administration building — the entire middle section was clawed out by a Russian ballistic missile late last month, killing 38 people, authorities say — stands as a powerful counterargument.
Mykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevich visited the site this week, squinting in the sun as he gazed at the pancaked floors and an air-conditioning unit suspended from a wire somehow still attached to the building’s roof.
“When people ask me if it’s safe to stay, I tell them 10 civilians died last week and more than 40 were injured. If that sounds safe to you, then stay. But I think you should leave, so we can fight more easily,” Senkevich said, adding that hundreds were being shuttled to the border with Moldova every day.
A onetime IT entrepreneur turned politician, Senkevich had traded his suit for gray tactical pants, a fleece sweatshirt and a short-nozzled AK-47SU equipped with a silencer and flash suppressor. It was a switch he had done in the run-up to the invasion, but he kept it on because he didn’t see a respite coming.
“We need to be prepared for any kind of situation, especially when we see the Russian troops are now regrouping,” he said.
“People even sometimes forget that there’s war. I would say that people feel too comfortable.”"

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 1.2%, its fourth straight gain. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 1% higher and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.8%. The latest gains build on the major indexes’ gains the last two weeks, even in the midst of choppy trading and volatile energy prices.
The market rally followed signs that the first face-to-face talks in two weeks between Russia and Ukraine made some progress. Turkey hosted the discussions Tuesday, and the nation’s foreign minister said afterward that Russian and Ukrainian negotiators had reached “a consensus and common understanding” on some issues.
Russia’s military said it would “fundamentally” cut back operations near Ukraine’s capital and a northern city, as talks brought a possible deal to end a grinding and brutal war into view.
President Biden said Tuesday that he wasn’t convinced yet that Russia’s announcement about scaling back its military operations will lead to a fundamental shift in the war.

Buying a home for the first time is one of life’s sweet milestones.


Still, markets welcomed the developments and how they might affect the potential duration and effect of rising inflation on businesses and consumers when the conflict began a month ago.
“There’s a sense of hope in the market today that a resolution is nearing there,” said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally Invest.

The S&P 500 rose 56.08 points to 4,631.60. The Dow gained 338.30 points to 35,294.19, and the Nasdaq rose 264.73 points to 14,619.64.
Smaller-company stocks outpaced the broader market in a sign that investors were confident about the economy. The Russell 2000 rose 55.04 points, or 2.7%, to 2,113.10.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been unsettling markets and adding to lingering concerns about persistently rising inflation and global economic growth.
“What we’ve seen over the course of last several weeks is capital markets have looked toward removing some of the worst-case scenarios,” said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Energy prices have been extremely volatile as the conflict continues, but have been easing over the last few days. Pressure on prices is also being relieved as Chinese authorities lock down Shanghai because of a surge in COVID-19 cases, which could crimp global demand for oil.
U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.6% and Brent crude, the international standard, slid 6.8%. Prices are still up more than 30% globally, but were up more than 50% as of just last week.
Falling oil prices weighed down energy companies, which had some of the biggest losses Tuesday. Chevron fell 1.2%.
More than 85% of the stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 rose. Technology and communication stocks helped power the rally, along with big retail chains, automakers and other companies that rely on consumer spending. Apple rose 1.9% and Netflix added 3.5%. Ford Motor climbed 6.5% and General Motors gained 4.6%.
European markets rose, while Asian markets closed mixed overnight.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans, fell to 2.39% from 2.47% late Tuesday. It briefly dropped below the two-year Treasury’s yield, what Wall Street calls an “inversion” of the Treasury yield curve. Investors take note of this because prolonged yield inversions have accurately predicted previous U.S. recessions. The two-year Treasury yield rose to 2.36%.
The brief inversion in the yield curves may just be a blip, given that in the times when they’ve preceded a recession, they’ve remained inverted for some time and, even then, it has taken an average of 18 months before a recession followed, Bell said.
“Developments in that part of the yield curve over the next couple of days, next couple of weeks, will be really important to watch,” she said.
Bond yields had been rising as Wall Street prepares for higher interest rates after years of ultra-low interest policies from central banks around the world. The rate hikes are part of a strategy to help temper the effects of rising inflation.
The Federal Reserve has already announced a 0.25% hike of its key benchmark interest rate and is prepared to continue raising rates.
Wall Street is also reviewing the latest economic updates this week. U.S. consumer confidence bounced back in March, according to a report from business research group the Conference Board.
The Commerce Department will release its February report for personal income and spending Thursday and the Labor Department will release its employment report for March on Friday."
LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-03-29/worldwide-patriarch-orthodox-church-denounces-invasion-ukraine;2022-03-29;Worldwide Orthodox Church leader denounces Ukraine invasion - Los Angeles Times;"The spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians on Tuesday denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an “atrocious” act that is causing enormous suffering.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I didn’t mention Russia by name in comments made during a visit to Warsaw after meeting with Ukrainian refugees. Poland has accepted the largest number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine.
“It is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,” Bartholomew said at a news briefing. He added that solidarity with Ukrainians “is the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world.”
Bartholomew, who is based in Istanbul, is considered “first among equals” among Orthodox patriarchs. Although he is the titular head of the Orthodox Church worldwide, other Orthodox leaders — including Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church — are able to wield more power from their base in countries with larger Orthodox populations.
Kirill is closely allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin and, instead of condemning the invasion, has hailed Russian soldiers as defenders of the fatherland and painted the war in spiritual terms, as a battle between good and evil — the latter being exemplified by the decadent West.
Ukraine’s population is mostly Orthodox Christian, but is divided between an independent church based in Kyiv and another one loyal to Kirill in Moscow.
World & Nation
Putin’s war relies on an ultranationalist ideology pushed by far-right Russian thinkers who see Ukrainian nationhood as a fiction.

Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church severed contact with Bartholomew after the Istanbul patriarch recognized the Orthodox Church of Ukraine as independent of the Moscow patriarch in 2019.

Even though Putin justified his invasion of Ukraine in part as a defense of the Moscow-oriented Orthodox Church, leaders of both Ukrainian Orthodox factions are fiercely condemning the Russian invasion, as is Ukraine’s significant Catholic minority.
Bartholomew said it was hard to find words to describe the suffering of the Ukrainians he met in Poland and referred to Scripture instead, quoting the prophet Jeremiah: “If my head was a spring of water, and if my eyes were a fountain of tears, I would weep all day and night for the slaying of my people.”
Bartholomew also met with Roman Catholic Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki, the head of the Polish Bishops’ Conference, who went even further in his denunciation of Russia’s actions, which he said bore “the hallmarks of genocide.” Unlike Bartholomew, Gadecki mentioned Russia by name.
World & Nation
Moscow says it will scale back its offensive around the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv in part to give more impetus to peace talks.

Gądecki said Russia’s invasion has resulted in the deaths of “thousands of innocent people” including “hundreds of children, elderly people, women and men who had nothing to do with the hostilities.”
“Many of the aggressor’s actions bear the hallmarks of genocide,” Gadecki said.
The senior Polish cleric earlier this month urged Kirill to use his influence with Putin to demand an end to the war and for Russian soldiers to stand down — going further than Pope Francis in his public statements to date."

For the past month, the Japanese American director has  posted stark photographs on his Instagram account to document the humanitarian relief efforts for displaced Ukrainians in the wake of Russia’s continued attacks.
Fukunaga, who has been in Ukraine since March 19, told The Times in an email from Kharkiv: “I’ve taken pictures, but I’m here as a humanitarian and not a documentarian.”

Posted on March 24, his first photo from Ukraine showed three women sitting side by side at a shelter in Lviv and gave a glimpse of their plight.
“Valentina came to western Ukraine to celebrate the 35th anniversary of her marriage. Her children gave her and her husband a trip to the Carpathian Mountains, which she had long dreamed of visiting,” Fukunaga’s caption read.
“They spent a wonderful weekend there and were on their way back to the train station when they were told that war had broken out. Now her children and grandchildren have left Ukraine, but the men of the family cannot leave.”

Three organizations with operations in California are helping people in eastern Ukraine, and so is the Red Cross. Here’s how you can contribute.

The same post featured  the story of a woman named Oksana,  who was “forced to flee Kharkiv, which has been under constant shelling since the first day of the war. She did not want to abandon her family and husband, but she had to do it to save her child,” the caption read.
Oksana told Fukunaga, “We were just raising our grandchildren. Now we are here. We didn’t ask for this. We did not ask to be ‘liberated’.”

Fukunaga’s posts have also documented some of the humanitarian relief efforts by renowned Spanish chef José Andrés and his nonprofit organization World Central Kitchen throughout Ukraine.

The Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was under Russian siege and bombardment for 38 days

Andrés was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2015 by former President Barack Obama  for providing meals  in war zones and during natural disasters.
One of Fukanaga’s posts on April 3 shows Andrés on the ground delivering “6000 kilos of groceries, 600 warm meals,” wrote Fukunaga.
Fukunaga’s latest post, from April 8, drew attention to a woman in uniform named Galyna, who used to run the Dnipro metro station that is now being utilized as a bomb shelter.

Daniel Craig and Cary Joji Fukunaga had one shot at a final impression in the James Bond epic, “No Time to Die.” They emptied the chamber.

“She hasn’t been home since the war began as there is still too much to do. The first days saw up to 2800 people crowding into the cold-war era shelter, replete with an underground cafe and pharmacy, and in case of a nuclear attack, 40cm thick iron blast doors that still shut at curfew,” Fukunaga wrote in the caption, adding that volunteers from World Central Kitchen deliver meals and fresh fruit to the station daily.
Fukunaga told The Times  that his goal, apart from trying to keep people fed near the frontlines, is “working on a seed program for Ukrainian farms and looking at expanding to mid-size commercial farms.”
He added: “We’ve been doing this in cooperation with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Ministry of Agriculture but with huge support from Alexander Kamyshin, the head of the Ukrainian rail system, who also used to be a farmer.”"

The price tag on Monday? $550.
Mendoza — who lives in Moreno Valley and often hauls clothes, makeup and, these days, personal protective equipment — works as an independent contractor. But he is locked into specific shipments, so he can’t switch up his route in an effort to save gas. And the fuel surcharge the government pays his company to help offset prices almost never makes it down to him, Mendoza said, so more expensive gas translates to a pay cut.
“It makes it harder to pay my bills,” he said.
Even before last week, when Russia, one of the world’s top producers of petroleum and other crude oil, invaded neighboring Ukraine and set off Europe’s largest ground war in 75 years, gas prices had ballooned in reaction to pandemic supply-chain issues and inflation.
In L.A. County, the average cost of a gallon of regular-grade fuel is $4.90 — up from $4.67 a month ago and $3.75 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Assn. In Orange County, the average is up to $4.87 from $4.65 a month ago and $3.73 a year ago.
The escalating Ukraine conflict is among a trifecta of factors that will disproportionately affect low-income earners — especially those who, like Mendoza, rely on their vehicles to make a living.
“If you’re a lower-income person commuting from Riverside into Irvine, it’s going to hit you really hard,” said Eric Swanson, a professor of economics at UC Irvine.
World & Nation
Russian tanks and troops crossed into Ukraine on Thursday after a night of shelling. But why is Russia attacking Ukraine? What is Putin’s goal?

While gasoline isn’t a big part of the average American’s budget — about 3%, Swanson said, compared with about 40% for housing costs, which also are rising — hikes in gas prices are regressive, meaning they hit lower-income people relatively harder than higher earners. And increased gas prices create a ripple effect, Swanson said, eventually leading to higher prices for almost all transported goods.
“Even before Ukraine, we were having the worst inflation since 1980,” Swanson said, noting that, in addition to oil, Russia is a major producer of wheat and palladium, a metal used to make electronic chips.
“Prices are going to go up,” he said.
In many places across the Southland, they already have.
Carlos Perez, who owns El Monte-based C.P. Towing Service, said increased gas prices recently forced him to raise his rates for several  services, including a simple tire change and hauling crashed vehicles.
“That’s just the business,” he said. “Everything is going up.”
The 55-year-old, who runs the company on his own and often works 14-hour shifts, typically covers Los Angeles and Orange counties but sometimes makes farther pickups, he said, including one that was 700 miles away.
Politics
U.S. and its allies have held off on taking the toughest sanction against Russia over Ukraine, worried about risks of political and economic blowback.



To cover that kind of mileage, he fills up his 2016 Peterbilt flatbed truck almost every day, shelling out $200 each time — up from $160 at this time last year, he said.
It’s been challenging, but Perez finds encouragement from his customers’ loyalty and positive reviews.
“Gas is high, but what can you do?” he said. “I’m happy work hasn’t stopped.”
For some workers, including many Uber and Lyft drivers, rising gas prices have made them consider changing careers altogether.
More than 5,000 people have signed an online petition urging the ride-hailing companies to increase their rates to help drivers cover gas prices.
“Gas hikes are brutal,” one signatory wrote Monday evening.
Another driver posted, “I barely break even. Not worth it to drive anymore and beat up my car.”
Benjamin Valdez, a part-time Uber driver, upgraded last fall from his Toyota Prius to an SUV  — a decision shaped, in part, by the fact that Uber pays $1.20 per mile for XL rides (those that fit up to six passengers) versus 60 cents per mile in smaller vehicles.
Business
The member countries of the International Energy Agency have agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their strategic reserves.


In retrospect, Valdez said, it was probably the wrong move. The new vehicle takes more gas, and the demand for Uber XLs is largely during the day, when Valdez can’t drive because he’s working his other job in computer tech for a community college.  He’s now considering switching to a taxi company, which would let him use his personal vehicle and pay around $3 per mile — a steep raise from what he makes at Uber.
Another Uber driver, who lives in Orange County and asked to be identified only by his first name, Taje, said that when he started with the company in 2017, he could sometimes find gas for $2.18 a gallon, less than half the current average in the county.
For Alexis Fernandez, a third-generation date farmer from Coachella, rising gas prices have made her daily routine much more stressful. The 25-year-old wakes up most days at 3:30 a.m. to pack sweet Medjool and creamy Barhi dates from her family’s ranch to sell at farmers markets across the Southland.
She used to make the long treks in the ranch’s cargo van, which she enjoyed because it sits high and has powerful headlights, making  it easier to see while driving  during the dark early-morning hours. And because the van is spacious, another employee accompanied her on the trips to help keep her awake and run the family’s stand once they arrived.
Business
Will gas and food prices continue to rise? How might the conflict in Eastern Europe affect Silicon Valley and Hollywood?


But on Monday, when Fernandez drove through the darkness for 140 miles from her home to the South Gate Farmers Market, she was alone in her personal car, a Nissan Altima. The front and back seats were piled high with plastic boxes of dates — leaving no space for a passenger.
“It’s a decision of paying $40 to fill up my Nissan or $90 to drive the van,” she said. “We just can’t afford to use it every day, so changes have to be made.”
To help offset the higher costs, Fernandez said, the ranch in January raised its prices by $1: A one-pound pack of dates now sells for $7.
At the Azteca Farms stand, vendor Irma Suárez, 48, said she recently raised the price of all her produce by 50 cents. Kale and broccoli now sell for $3 a pound; Brussels sprouts are $4.
“We had some complaints when we first made the change, because customers didn’t want to pay more,” Suárez said. “But our vegetables are quality and better than what you’re going to find at the grocery store.”
Almost every morning, Suárez and her husband, Vicente, who own 20 acres in eastern Ventura County, load one to two tons of produce into their Ford F-350 diesel truck and head to a farmers market in the Southland.
They’ve been selling at markets for 22 years, Suárez said, and always take the same route.
“Right before we get on the freeway, we pass the same gas station, and it feels like every other day, the price is higher than the last time,” she said, noting that she’d shelled out $130 that day to fill up the truck.
On Monday afternoon, Rosalinda Diaz, a 73-year-old retired waitress from South Los Angeles, surveyed the Azteca Farms vegetables before settling on a pound of green onions and a head of lettuce. It totaled $3, leaving her with $2 in her purse.
Diaz, who lives on a fixed income of around $1,300 a month, said that although she primarily uses public transportation, she knows that higher gas prices mean rising prices in general.
“You have to buy less and do more with less, even if you don’t own a car,” she said. “Everything is going up except Social Security.”

Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state.
A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.”
There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court.
Several organizations in California, as well as international aid groups, are helping refugees, wounded soldiers and others in and around Ukraine. Here’s how you can contribute.

Gas prices have surged in the last several months and California boasts the highest prices in the nation. Inflation is one reason for the jump at the pump, but so is the war in Ukraine and the removal of Russian oil from the international market, along with taxes found only in California due to the state’s strict environmental regulations.
Prices continue to increase across the state, much to the anger and distress of drivers.
This time last year, the average cost of gas in California was $4.21. On Monday, the average cost for a gallon of regular is $6.34, according to AAA’s gas price tracker. In Mono County, a gallon of regular is $7.04, which is the highest listed price across the  state on the AAA tracker.
But Schlafer’s Auto Body & Repair in Mendocino has a gallon of regular at $9.60, about $3 higher than the county’s average of  $6.38.
Business
High gas prices aren’t going away soon, but if you’re paying extra for premium, you probably can save the money. And don’t even think about midgrade.

This is not the first time the four-pump station has garnered attention-grabbing headlines for having the most expensive gas in the country. Last year, the station charged a quaint $6.73 a gallon, according to SF Gate.
Owner Judy Schlafer recently told SF Gate that she needs to raise her prices to cover high overhead costs.
“I’m going to be lucky if I make the year with all the fees, the regulation, the payroll fees,” Schlafer told SF Gate. “If it continues the way it is, Mendocino won’t have a gas station next year.”
Schlafer told KGO-TV in the Bay Area that she operates as an independent business and does not have a convenience store at the station, which would allow her business to recoup costs by selling food and other goods.
A person at the business who answered the phone Monday declined to speak with The Times about gas prices.
California
From online services to paying with cash, here are some ways to save at the pump.

Farther north, Humboldt County’s average gas price is $6.80 and Monterey County‘s  is $6.46. But the Big Sur Chevron in Monterey County lists a gallon of regular at $7.10.

Some remote locations are left with little choice but to charge higher prices, said  Troy Vincent, a senior market analyst with energy analysis firm DTN.
“Specific areas seeing far higher prices than the state average like in Mendocino and Big Sur are largely outliers because of transportation costs and low volumes,” Vincent said in an email. “When a retailer sells small quantities and requires a delivery truck fueled by extremely expensive diesel fuel to make a lengthy drive to deliver the gasoline, these specific retail stations are under unique pressure to raise prices far in excess of the state average in order to maintain their margins.”
While some locations continue to charge more than the national average, the cost of gas shows no signs of dropping anytime soon, AAA spokesperson Anlleyn Venegas said Monday.
Over the Memorial Day weekend, a large influx of travelers hit  the road for the first time  since the pandemic started. That strong showing is a good indicator that fuel demand is going to remain high.
“Travel is going to continue to add to the demand for gasoline,” said Venegas, who recommends shoppers use apps on their phones to shop around for lower prices in their areas.
In the last week, the national cost of gas has jumped 25 cents, according to AAA. The national average of gas in the U.S. is 59 cents more than a month ago at $4.86 and $1.81 more than a year ago, according to AAA."

Hello, it’s Thursday, Feb. 24, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Putin says he is proceeding with a military operation in Ukraine
While the U.N. Security Council was meeting to avert war, several loud explosions were reportedly heard outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early Thursday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his forces were conducting a military operation to disarm the country but not take it over.
The move was a stunning — if expected — play from a leader who for weeks has massed his troops on Ukraine’s borders while brandishing threatening rhetoric and snubbing diplomacy.
Huge traffic snarls formed in Kyiv as residents tried to flee the Ukrainian capital. Video showed Russian armored vehicles advancing into mainland Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow illegally seized eight years ago. Ukrainian air-traffic controllers sealed off the country’s airspace “due to the high risk of aviation safety for civil aviation.”
President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law in his embattled nation and encouraged his compatriots to take up arms.
The latest incursion shatters nearly three decades of relative peace in Europe and is certain to elicit a forceful response from the U.S. and NATO. Both Washington and its transatlantic allies have promised to impose even harsher sanctions than those enacted just days ago.
But Putin, who vowed to protect the Russia-backed separatist eastern region of Ukraine, was unbowed and belligerent, warning other countries to stay out of the conflict or risk “consequences they have never seen.”

President Biden swiftly condemned Russia’s attack and said he would be meeting with other world leaders on Thursday to discuss a response.
Here is the latest.

L.A. County establishments can drop mask rules with vaccine verification
Individuals who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to shed their masks in certain indoor settings in Los Angeles County starting at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The revised rules will make masking optional indoors at establishments, businesses or venues that screen the vaccination status of their visitors or patrons, according to a statement from the county Department of Public Health.
According to the county, establishments that want to allow fully vaccinated customers to go maskless indoors can do so — as long as they verify that all customers are either fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative for the coronavirus.
Unvaccinated individuals would still need to wear masks indoors. That rule is in place statewide. And places without vaccine verification will remain subject to the county’s standing indoor mask mandate, which applies to all residents regardless of vaccination status.

Permit problems stall Huntington Beach oil spill investigation
A federal investigation into the October oil spill that tarred the Orange County coast has been stalled for several months while officials wait for permission to cut apart, remove and analyze a portion of the ruptured pipeline. That analysis, which was expected to start in 2021, could help determine how long ago the damage to the pipeline occurred, a key factor in determining responsibility for the disaster.
Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board investigators currently must rely on video captured during underwater inspections of the pipeline. Without more detailed forensic examination of the damage in a laboratory, investigators won’t know if they should continue pursuing their initial line of inquiry or shift the probe in a new direction.
O.C. Dist. Atty. Todd Spitzer defends repeating the N-word when quoting hate speech
Orange County Dist. Atty. Todd Spitzer is facing increasing scrutiny after a video of his saying the N-word while describing two racist incidents surfaced this week. Spitzer repeated the slur during a speech he delivered to the Iranian American Bar Assn. in November 2019, outlining the rise in hate crimes in Orange County and describing several cases his office had recently prosecuted. The presentation was recorded and posted to YouTube.
The video comes on the heels of racist comments Spitzer allegedly made while discussing the case of a Black murder defendant. Spitzer, who is running for a second term as Orange County district attorney against two challengers, has faced a loss of political support and calls to resign since the alleged comments came to light last week.

El Salvador president’s Bitcoin experiment is costing his nation millions
A power-hungry populist who brands himself the “CEO of El Salvador,” President Nayib Bukele has become one of the world’s foremost Bitcoin evangelists since pushing a law through Congress that requires businesses to accept the cryptocurrency for goods and services. His grand plan has so far produced tepid results.
El Salvador is believed to have lost as much as $22 million in reserves thanks to dramatic plunges in the cryptocurrency’s value. Fraud targeting users of the country’s official Bitcoin wallet, known as Chivo, has been widespread, with at least 1,000 people reporting that their identities were stolen through the app.

Prosecutors in charge of Manhattan district attorney’s criminal probe of Trump resign. The two prosecutors in charge of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation into former President Trump suddenly resigned Wednesday, throwing the future of the probe into question.
A Manhattan judge says Sarah Palin is seeking a new trial in her New York Times defamation lawsuit. Palin, a former Republican vice presidential candidate, claimed in her 2017 lawsuit that the newspaper libeled her the same year with an editorial about gun control. The New York Times maintained that it quickly corrected any errors in the editorial and had made an “honest mistake” that was never meant to harm Palin.
Out of the global spotlight, a revived Iran nuclear deal appears imminent. After months of negotiations in Vienna, the various sides have indicated that a new deal is close, perhaps in the coming days. But instead of the “longer, stronger” agreement originally promised by the U.S., the deal is expected to do little more than reinstate the original pact.

“Jihad Rehab” started a furor at Sundance. But the problem is bigger than one film. The issue at the core of the maelstrom is not so much the text of the film as the fact that it was made by a white, non-Muslim filmmaker and arrived at a moment in which the debate over who is allowed to tell whose story was already at a boiling point, writes The Times’ Lorraine Ali.

Urban forests are in peril, but “Garden Bro” is here to help. With his tousled black hair and heart-melting smile, Gabe Verduzco certainly has the looks of an influencer. But he’s making his mark on social media by posting pictures of insects and native flowers, or himself in an orange workman’s vest climbing a massive oak tree in search of tiny beetles threatening our urban trees.
His main gig is as a research associate for the UC Cooperative Extension’s Agriculture and Natural Resources division, crawling around big urban trees like oaks and sycamores searching for the invasive shothole borer and the goldspotted oak borer — rice-size beetles that have killed many thousands of Southern California oaks, sycamores, willows and other trees since they were discovered less than 20 years ago and could well destroy many of our urban trees if left unchecked.

Seventy-four years ago today, the Freedom Train stopped in Los Angeles. The train had begun a nationwide trek in September 1947, carrying a whole trove of irreplaceable U.S. historical documents. It was a postwar effort at boosting national pride. The 126 documents were priceless, and yet they were insured. They included the Bill of Rights (insured for $225,000), the Emancipation Proclamation ($60,000) and Washington’s own copy of the Constitution ($10,000), according to the National Archives.
At the White House kickoff for the journey, concerns were raised about “the contradictions between some of the documents the train would carry and the practice of segregation.” It was determined that there would be no segregated viewing of the documents, which proved a problem when the train swung into the South. Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis, Tenn., refused to comply, so the train passed them by. It wound up its 413-day tour on Jan. 22, 1949.

After an hourlong call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden announced his administration was authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition and other security assistance to Ukraine.
Biden — with the seventh week of the war drawing to a close — said the new military aid  “will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”
“The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion,” Biden said. “It has helped ensure that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now.”
The latest package will include new capabilities that the U.S. hasn’t sent to Ukraine before, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said, including 18 howitzer artillery guns and 40,000 shells for the weapons and protective equipment against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare. Earlier Wednesday, officials from the European Council announced it agreed to $544 million in additional support for Ukrainian forces.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile, fired back after Biden said earlier in the week for the first time that Russia was committing genocide in Ukraine. Peskov told reporters that the remark was “hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times.”

Ukraine says it is investigating a claim that a poisonous substance was dropped on the besieged city of Mariupol.

As Russia’s assault on Ukraine continued, Finland and Sweden took steps to join the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which for years Putin has  warned them against.
Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said the Nordic country, which shares a border with Russia, would decide on whether to join NATO “within weeks.”
“Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,” Marin said alongside Sweden Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson at a news conference in Stockholm.

“I think people’s mind-sets in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and [were] shaped very dramatically because of Russia’s actions,” Marin said.
On Wednesday, Russian artillery pounded Ukrainian cities and towns in preparation for what is expected to be an all-out offensive in the country’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas. Satellite imagery from the U.S. firm Maxar Technologies has shown a growing buildup of Russian troops and heavy equipment in at least three likely staging grounds for an assault.
Western military officials and analysts have predicted a ferocious new phase of combat when that offensive begins but question whether Moscow’s military command can pivot away from previous strategic stumbles.

In a continuing show of support for Ukraine from front-line NATO countries, the presidents of Poland and the three Baltic states arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, on Wednesday for talks with Zelensky.
Ukrainian officials took the visiting presidents to see firsthand one of the Kyiv area’s worst-damaged towns: Borodyanka, where Russian shelling and bombardment destroyed numerous high-rise apartment buildings, among other structures. Authorities say dozens of people were killed but have provided no definitive casualty count.
In Moscow, a Defense Ministry spokesman said 1,026 members of Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including more than 160 officers, had voluntarily laid down their arms as a result of “successful offensives” by Russian troops and militia allies in Mariupol. It was unclear from the announcement when the alleged surrender had occurred.
Earlier in the week, the brigade had said in a Facebook post that it was running out of ammunition and had suffered a “mountain” of wounded. The Russian Defense Ministry said 151 Ukrainian soldiers were treated on the spot for injuries or hospitalized.
Ukrainian military officials did not immediately comment on the Russian claim, saying only that the fight for the city continued.
Many previous Russian claims, including weeks of the Kremlin’s insistence before the war that Russia had no plans to invade, have been proved false, and Moscow has justified the war with an elaborate campaign of disinformation, including claims that Ukraine is controlled by Nazis.

If borne out, however, the episode would represent one of the war’s largest single captures of Ukrainian troops.
Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, is considered a strategic prize because it offers control of a land corridor between Russian-held territory and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014. The city, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000, has been battered by daily Russian bombardment since the earliest days following the Feb. 24 invasion, and its mayor says an estimated 20,000 people have been killed.
Before Russia’s claim concerning Mariupol, Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Moscow leader of the Russian republic of Chechnya who has joined in the invading force, went on the messaging app Telegram to urge remaining Ukrainian forces to “end this pointless resistance.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, said on Twitter that defenders were fighting “for each meter of the city.”
Another presidential aide, Oleksiy Arestovych, said online that elements of the Ukrainian brigade in question, in a risky maneuver, had managed to link up with other Ukrainian forces. He did not comment on the alleged surrender.
Russian state television showed images of what it said were the surrendering Ukrainian marines being marched down a road.
The monthlong Russian occupation of several Kyiv suburbs and satellite towns left a gruesome trail of death and destruction, triggering an international outcry. Russia denies its troops committed atrocities against civilians, but international investigators have been amassing evidence of possible war crimes including execution-style killings and rapes.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a  report Wednesday that Russia had shown a “clear pattern” of breaking  international humanitarian law. At the same time, International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan, visiting the devastated Kyiv suburb of Bucha, has described the country as a  “crime scene” in interviews with reporters.
The Ukrainian prosecutor’s office said Wednesday that nearly 6,000 war crime complaints had been lodged, and Zelensky, in his overnight video address, expressed outrage over Putin’s claim a day earlier that alleged atrocities in Bucha were fake.
“There are not as many ‘specialists in staging’ in the world as there are murderers in the Russian army,” Zelensky said, describing it as “inevitable” that Russia would be held accountable.



In the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, Ukrainian officials have for days been urging civilians to leave in advance of expected widespread fighting. Departing involves deadly dangers, however; nearly 60 people were killed last week in a Russian missile strike on the railway station in the city of Kramatorsk when it was full of people trying to flee.
Finding a way out of the war zone is getting increasingly difficult. On Wednesday, the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said it had been impossible to open any humanitarian corridors for the day because Russian forces were violating local truces and blocking buses sent to evacuate civilians.

President Biden, in a speech on rising gas prices, says Russia’s actions in Ukraine amount to ‘genocide,’ a term the administration has previously avoided.

Despite growing fears over a Russian push to seize more eastern  territory, there was little outward sign of concern in Dnipro, a central city that is the country’s fourth largest and a way point for those fleeing the Donbas. Shops and restaurants were open, with roads packed with cars and traffic jams on major intersections.
Still, a train from the west into the city was mostly empty, with few traveling toward the zone where battles are expected to occur. Another train, hauling a pair of tanks, moved along the tracks, heading somewhere toward the eastern front lines.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-13/russian-war-worsens-fertilizer-crunch-risking-food-supplies;2022-04-13;Russia's war in Ukraine worsens fertilizer shortage, risking world food supplies - Los Angeles Times;"Monica Kariuki is about ready to give up on farming. What is driving her off her 10 acres of land outside Nairobi isn’t bad weather, pests or blight — the traditional agricultural curses — but fertilizer: It costs too much.
Despite thousands of miles separating her from the battlefields of Ukraine, Kariuki and her cabbage, corn and spinach farm are indirect victims of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The war has pushed up the price of natural gas, a key ingredient in fertilizer, and has led to severe sanctions against Russia, a major exporter of fertilizer.
Kariuki used to spend 20,000 Kenyan shillings, or about $175, to fertilize her entire farm. Now, she would need to spend five times as much. Continuing to work the land, she said, would yield nothing but losses.
“I cannot continue with the farming business. I am quitting farming to try something else,’’ she said.
Higher fertilizer prices are making the world’s food supply more expensive and less abundant as farmers skimp on nutrients for their crops, leading to lower yields. While the ripples will be felt by grocery shoppers in wealthy countries, the squeeze on food supplies will land hardest on families in poorer countries. And it could hardly come at a worse time: The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said last week that its world food price index in March reached its highest level since it started in 1990.
The fertilizer crunch threatens to further limit worldwide food supplies, already constrained by the disruption of crucial grain shipments from Ukraine and Russia. The loss of those affordable supplies of wheat, barley and other grains raises the prospect of food shortages and political instability in Middle Eastern, African and some Asian countries where millions rely on subsidized bread and cheap noodles.
“Food prices will skyrocket because farmers will have to make profit, so what happens to consumers?’’ said Uche Anyanwu, an agricultural expert at the University of Nigeria.
The aid group Action Aid warns that families in the Horn of Africa are already being driven “to the brink of survival.’’

The U.N. says Russia is the world’s No. 1 exporter of nitrogen fertilizer and No. 2 in phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Its ally Belarus, also contending with Western sanctions, is another major fertilizer producer.
Many developing countries — including Mongolia, Honduras, Cameroon, Ghana, Senegal, Mexico and Guatemala — rely on Russia for at least a fifth of their imports.
The conflict also has driven up the already exorbitant price of natural gas, used to make nitrogen fertilizer. The result: European energy prices are so high that some fertilizer companies “have closed their businesses and stopped operating their plants,’’ said David Laborde, a researcher at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
For corn and cabbage farmer Jackson Koeth, 55, of Eldoret in western Kenya, the conflict in Ukraine was distant and puzzling until he had to decide whether to go ahead with the planting season. Fertilizer prices had doubled from last year.
Koeth said he decided to keep planting but only on half the acreage of years past. Yet he doubts he can make a profit with fertilizer so costly.
Greek farmer Dimitris Filis, who grows olives, oranges and lemons, said “you have to search to find’’ ammonia nitrate and that the cost of fertilizing a 25-acre olive grove has doubled to 560 euros ($610). While selling his wares at an Athens  market, he said most farmers plan to skip fertilizing their olive and orange groves this year.
“Many people will not use fertilizers at all, and this as a result, lowers the quality of the production and the production itself, and slowly, slowly at one point, they won’t be able to farm their land because there will be no income,’’ Filis said.
In China, the price of potash — potassium-rich salt used as fertilizer — is up 86% from a year earlier. Nitrogen fertilizer prices have climbed 39% and phosphorus fertilizer is up 10%.
In the eastern Chinese city of Tai’an, the manager of a 35-family cooperative that raises wheat and corn said fertilizer prices have jumped 40% since the start of the year.
“We can hardly make any money,” said the manager, who would give only his surname, Zhao.
Terry Farms, which grows produce on 2,100 acres largely in Ventura County,  has seen prices of some fertilizer formulations double; others are up 20%. Shifting fertilizers is risky, company vice president William Terry said, because cheaper versions might not give “the crop what it needs as a food source.’'
As the growing season approaches in Maine, potato farmers are grappling with a 70% to 100% increase in fertilizer prices from last year, depending on the blend.
“I think it’s going to be a pretty expensive crop, no matter what you’re putting in the ground, from fertilizer to fuel, labor, electrical and everything else,” said Donald Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board.
In Prudentopolis, a town in Brazil’s Parana state, farmer Edimilson Rickli showed off a warehouse that would normally be packed with fertilizer bags but has only enough to last a few more weeks. He’s worried that, with the war in Ukraine showing no sign of letting up, he’ll have to go without fertilizer when he plants wheat, barley and oats next month.
“The question is: Where Brazil is going to buy more fertilizer from?” he said. “We have to find other markets.’'
Other countries are hoping to help fill the gaps. Nigeria, for example, opened Africa’s largest fertilizer factory last month, and the $2.5-billion plant has already shipped fertilizer to the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico.
India, meanwhile, is seeking more fertilizer imports from Israel, Oman, Canada and Saudi Arabia to make up for lost shipments from Russia and Belarus.
“If the supply shortage gets worse, we will produce less,” said Kishor Rungta of the nonprofit Fertilizer Assn. of India. “That’s why we need to look for options to get more fertilizers in the country.”
Agricultural firms are providing support for farmers, especially in Africa, where poverty often limits access to vital farm inputs. In Kenya, Apollo Agriculture is helping farmers get fertilizer and access to finance.
“Some farmers are skipping the planting season and others are going into some other ventures such as buying goats to cope,” said Benjamin Njenga, co-founder of the firm. “So these support services go a long way for them.”
Governments are helping, too. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it was issuing $250 million in grants to support U.S. fertilizer production. The Swiss government has released part of its nitrogen fertilizer reserves.
Still, there’s no easy answer to the double whammy of higher fertilizer prices and limited supplies. The next 12 to 18 months, food researcher LaBorde said, “will be difficult.’'
The market already was “super, super tight” before the war, said Kathy Mathers of the Fertilizer Institute trade group.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, growers are just happy to get fertilizer at all,’’ she said.

LA Times;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-28/costa-mesa-couple-barely-escape-ukraine-with-days-old-newborn;2022-02-28;Costa Mesa couple barely escape Ukraine with days-old newborn - Los Angeles Times;"Minutes after Jessie Boeckmann started her trek with her 4-day-old infant toward the Ukrainian-Polish border in 30-degree weather, she questioned whether she’d made the right choice.
The 39-year-old Costa Mesa resident held Vivian in a baby carrier, underneath her down jacket, a swaddle and a blanket to block the brutal wind chill. She worried it wouldn’t be enough and Vivian would freeze to death. Her husband, Jacob Boeckmann, carried their two suitcases.
Every 10 to 20 minutes, the couple checked to make sure that Vivian was warm enough and still breathing. Several elderly women who were part of the westward exodus of panicked refugees fleeing the Russian advance shook their heads or shared a disapproving look.
“What have I done to my sweet angel?” Jessie, an ophthalmologist, thought to herself. “This could be the worst decision I’ve ever made.”
The couple were 26 hours into an ordeal that had begun early Thursday, when artillery explosions rocked the capital of Kyiv and woke them as they slept at a hospital with their newborn.
In 2019, the Boeckmanns, who’ve been married nearly a decade, had had a daughter by a surrogate mother in Ukraine. When they decided to have a second child, they set their sights once again on Ukraine.
Vivian originally was due Feb. 23. The timing made the Boeckmanns nervous. They’d been paying attention to the region’s escalating political tensions. The couple rejoiced when they got word that their surrogate, Lilya, would give birth to their daughter earlier than expected, on Valentine’s Day.
Still, the Boeckmanns contacted the U.S. Embassy in case they found themselves in a tricky situation.
The couple left their Costa Mesa home on Feb. 13 to travel to Kyiv for the baby’s birth the following day. But when they arrived, the doctors said the baby needed more time to gestate and refused to induce Lilya early.
So the couple had to wait, watching as tensions between Ukraine and Russia rose every day and tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the border for an invasion. The couple knew the situation had taken a bad turn when the airport in Kyiv suspended flights.

“We’re going to have to exit through Poland,” Jacob thought.
World & Nation
Some 500,000 Ukrainians have fled their homeland since Russia invaded last week.

Meanwhile, the couple kept pushing doctors to induce Lilya, the surrogate, so that Vivian would come sooner. But hospital officials wouldn’t budge.
Vivian finally was delivered last Tuesday morning, but the Boeckmanns didn’t get much chance to see her.
They knew they had to move fast to secure her travel documents. Without a birth certificate, the couple wouldn’t be able to legally take her out the country. Also, Vivian wasn’t eating well, so the couple had to hunt down alternate baby formulas to assure she was medically stable. The whole time, the specter of imminent war loomed.
After waking up to the sound of explosions Thursday morning, the Boeckmanns knew it was time to leave. They had Vivian’s birth certificate. But they didn’t have the doctor’s discharge order.
“No, you can’t leave without the doctor seeing the baby,” the nurses said.
“The baby is OK,” Jessie said. Anxious, she knew they had to get out soon.
After 30 minutes of back-and-forth, the couple and Vivian left despite the nurses’ objections.
Their original driver to the border, a man named Alex — who spoke English — could no longer pick them up, but he sent another driver, Val, who spoke only Russian. They communicated with the help of Google Translate, and set out on their journey to the temporary U.S. Embassy, about 340 miles west, in Lviv, near the border with Poland.
World & Nation
Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

It was supposed to be six- to seven-hour road trip, but it became a 27-hour ordeal. It took the couple four hours just to get out of Kyiv. Val zig-zagged across the city, trying to find the fastest way out. They were part of a mass of thousands escaping the city. They passed traffic jams at gas stations and long lines at banks where people tried to withdraw their money.
All the while, Vivian slept. She cried when she was hungry but quieted soon as she was fed. Otherwise, she was silent.
Several times, a woman telephoned Val, yelling in Russian. The couple eventually deduced it was Val’s wife, calling in a panic and begging him to return home.
The Boeckmanns looked at each other but didn’t say much. They felt guilty for taking Val away from his family, but they were scared.
“Is this man going to keep driving us or is he going to leave us somewhere on our own?” Jacob thought to himself.
A few hours into their trek, they got word that the temporary U.S. Embassy had closed. They would have to drive to Poland — about 30 miles northwest. They told Val they’d pay him more, and he agreed to drive them as far as he could.
Once they got to the border, traffic ground to a halt. It was 2 a.m. They slept in the car overnight. It was below freezing, and the couple worried that Vivian might freeze in her car seat. Jessie and Jacob took turns holding the baby and keeping her warm while the other one of them slept for a couple of hours. Traffic moved a bit but then came to a dead stop about eight miles from the actual border crossing.
At 9:30 a.m., Jessie realized they were no longer moving at all.
“Jacob, we need to walk. We’re not going to make it if we don’t walk,” she told her husband.
They passed a sea of vehicles — all them packed with people and possessions. At one point, the fumes from vehicle exhaust became overwhelming. It was colder than they’d expected. They’d left their only shelter behind. Jessie cried.
She realized she’d made the right choice after walking past seven miles of motionless cars and trucks. Ukrainian officials had stopped virtually all vehicles from crossing the border into Poland.
“Oh my goodness, we made it!” Jessie said when they got to the border. Then they saw the crush of people at the gate.
It was chaos. There wasn’t a line, only three Ukrainian border guards with machine guns. Men pushed. Children cried. Women screamed. After waiting 2 ½ hours, the crowd pushed Jessie and Vivian through. The throng pushed so hard that Jessie had to keep her arms out to prevent the crowd from crushing Vivian.
But the crowd wouldn’t allow Jacob through.
“That is my wife and baby. Let me go with them,” the father pleaded. But the mass of refugees still wouldn’t let him pass. He later discovered that border officials weren’t allowing men inside the gates, only women and children.
Jacob had been in communication with U.S. Embassy officials who had told him he’d be able to clear customs and get into Poland with his American passport. Jacob pleaded with the guards who yelled back at him, “Fake passport!” At one point a guard picked him up and threw him against the steel gate.
As Russian air raids started in nearby Lviv, the tension grew. On the other side of the gate, Jessie pleaded with the guards to let her husband through, but they brushed her off and told her to get in line to clear customs.
Then Vivian started to cry. She was hungry. But the bag with the baby formula and water bottles were with Jacob, on the other side of the barbed wire. Jessie’s passport, Vivian’s birth certificate, and baby clothes were also in her husband’s bag.
“I need to feed my baby! I need the baby’s food!” she pleaded with the guards.
Business
Gov. Newsom calls on state pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS, as well as the UC Retirement System, to divest Russian assets over the war in Ukraine.

With the help of a Ukrainian American family, she persuaded a guard to allow her husband to pass the bag through the crowd and over the gate. She was able to feed Vivian.
Realizing her husband wouldn’t be able to join her, Jessie cried, but got in line. After she cleared customs, she called her mother in Arkansas, who’d been in contact with her state representatives, pressuring them to help her daughter and son-in-law get out.
“Mom, Jacob is stuck on the other side. You have to get him out,” she told her mother.
“I’m on it,” her mother told her. “Everything will be OK.”
Jacob knew his odds were slim, but he persisted. U.S. Embassy officials on the phone told him to keep pleading his case. He showed the female guards who helped his wife pictures of the family together.
“This is my wife and my daughter. Here is my American passport,” he told them.
The guards brushed him off once more. Eventually, a lead guard who’d received a photo of Jacob from U.S. Embassy officials told him to head over to the sealed-off automobile entrance, where he was let in.
The Boeckmanns finally reunited at 2 a.m. Saturday, made their way to Warsaw, where they checked into a hotel and were planning leave early Tuesday on a return flight to Los Angeles. They are among an estimated 500,000 people who’ve fled the country so far.
The couple know they are lucky to have gotten out of Ukraine, and said that their hearts break for the Ukrainian people — thousands of whom have taken up arms to resist the incoming Russians — and others who remain in the war-torn country.
On Monday, Jessie received a text from Lilya.
“We are being shot very hard. We are constantly afraid,” the text read. “We are afraid of what will happen next.”
Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state.
A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.”
There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court.
Several organizations in California, as well as international aid groups, are helping refugees, wounded soldiers and others in and around Ukraine. Here’s how you can contribute.

Hello, it’s Monday, April 11, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Russia’s Ukraine invasion has escalated a brewing battle over space
Friction with the Kremlin, most recently aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has seeped into space, exacerbating tensions over the rules of behavior there and halting negotiations over space weapons at a time when the battlegrounds of war are moving to the edges of Earth’s atmosphere.
Space has long been a barometer of the U.S.-Russia relationship. The 1998 International Space Station agreement — which also includes the European Union, Japan and Canada — signaled a new era of shared advancement in the post-Cold War period. For more than two decades, the jointly operated station has been spinning around Earth.
But that space détente was waning long before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and the U.S. and its allies targeted Moscow’s space industry in a raft of economic sanctions.

Ukraine braces for a redoubled Russian assault in the east and south
The Ukrainian military stiffened defenses against Russian assaults in the east and south as the nation’s president framed the war as an existential threat to all of European democracy.

The Ukrainian military said it was resisting Russian efforts in the east to break through from the city of Izyum, which Russian forces have seized as a strategic foothold to take more territory.
Ukraine said it was also continuing to fight off Russian attacks in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, much of which has been destroyed in weeks of street fighting and shelling. It also reported a missile strike on an airport in the city of Dnipro in which five emergency workers were wounded.

The stunning climb in homicide rates in recent years in California and big cities across the nation obscures a remarkably good-news trend involving young children: The number of child homicide victims fell dramatically in California over the last decade, the latest death certificate data show, a pattern mirrored to a lesser extent nationwide.
Most child homicides involve newborns, infants and young toddlers. Experts say “safe surrender” laws, which allow parents to confidentially surrender an infant 3 days old or younger without fear of prosecution, have clearly made a difference. Better access to family planning services may also play a role in the decline of child homicides as people give birth to fewer unwanted babies.
Back to normal? For some, the COVID-19 threat hasn’t gone away
As government agencies have cast off pandemic protections, many immunocompromised and disabled people have felt forgotten. Mask mandates have been rolled back, but crucial medications to prevent COVID-19 in immunocompromised people can still be hard to get. Federal money for testing and treating uninsured people has been drying up, just as a coronavirus subvariant is on the rise.
Health officials have started focusing more heavily on hospitalizations than coronavirus cases to gauge risk levels in communities. This fails to reassure immunocompromised people who face danger from high levels of coronavirus transmission. And although the White House recently announced a new push to clean indoor air, some critics say the government should have acted much sooner to ensure public spaces are safe.

Karen Bass and Rick Caruso are in a dead heat, mayoral poll finds
A seemingly limitless geyser of cash and voters upset over crime have propelled Rick Caruso to the front of the race for mayor, reshaping the race and offering Los Angeles a stark contrast between the billionaire developer and his chief rival, Rep. Karen Bass.
If the primary were today, Caruso, with backing from 24% of likely voters, and Bass, with 23%, would move to the November runoff, according to a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times.
A contest between the two would feature stark divides of ideology, race and geography as well as different perceptions of Los Angeles and its governance, all of which have begun to emerge in the primary campaign.

Golf pioneer Lee Elder broke the color barrier as the first Black golfer to play in the Masters 47 years ago. But the indignities that Elder and other Black golfers endured at that time were a constant.
Fearing for his safety, he rented two houses in Augusta during his first Masters so people wouldn’t know exactly where he was staying. During the week leading up to the tournament, he and friends who had joined him on the trip from Washington, D.C., were denied service at a local establishment because of their race.
Upon hearing that, Julius Scott, then the president of Paine College in Augusta, Ga., told Elder and his friends that chefs from the school would be preparing their meals for the rest of the week.
During his career, Elder made 448 starts on the PGA Tour with four victories, including the 1974 Monsanto Open in Pensacola, Fla., which earned him an invitation to the Masters. During that Florida tournament, he received death threats and was accompanied by armed security guards as he walked down the middle of the fairways.
He died in November at age 87.

The intensified assault came even as the United States insisted diplomacy still had a role in the conflict and as Moscow pressed its propaganda war at the United Nations, with the specter emerging of a Russian biological or chemical attack.
President Biden on Friday turned up economic pressure on Moscow, an “aggressor” that “must pay the price,” he said, revoking trade relations with the nation and banning Russian products such as diamonds and vodka. But Biden again refused Ukrainian pleas for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which U.S. and NATO officials say would inevitably bring Russia and the United States into direct conflict and escalate the war.
“We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said at the White House. “Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III.”

The U.S. and its NATO allies instead have supplied Ukraine with tons of weaponry and beefed up forces on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastern flank, in countries such as Poland and Romania that border Ukraine.
Biden made the announcement after speaking again to Ukraine’s defiant and embattled president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Early Friday, Russian warplanes conducted three airstrikes on Dnipro — Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, in the country’s southeast — hitting a kindergarten, an apartment building and a two-story shoe factory, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. The factory was still burning more than two hours after the attack, and at least one person was killed, the emergency service said.
Those strikes followed a bombing run on the Lutsk military airfield in the northwest, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency said, quoting Yuriy Pohulyaiko, head of the military administration in the area. Pohulyaiko said two soldiers were killed and six others wounded.
Airstrikes also hit the airport in Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine, said Mayor Ruslan Martsynkiv.

“The enemy has struck at Frankivsk. There were explosions at our airport. Remain calm, the relevant services are working,” Martsynkiv wrote on his official Facebook page, urging residents to leave the area and not to spread photos or videos of the explosions.
Russia’s attacks in western Ukraine bring the fighting closer to bordering NATO countries, where assaults could trigger a wider war involving the West.
World & Nation
As the war in Ukraine rages, ordinary Russians face a degree of international isolation not seen in decades. What will Putin do next?

In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday it was unclear whether the strikes marked a significant push west. “The vast, vast majority of their combat power is being spent in the east,” he said in a news briefing.
The capital, Kyiv, is at heightened risk, he added. Russian troops “are beginning to make more momentum on the ground toward Kyiv, particularly from the east,” he said.
“There’s Russian bombardment and shelling going on quite violently as we speak.”
Russian forces continued their intense bombardment of the southeastern city of Mariupol on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said in a video message on Facebook. Mariupol was the site of the shelling and destruction this week of a maternity hospital, prompting some Western officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, to call for a war crimes investigation.
“Two days of hell, Armageddon,” Boichenko said, adding that the Russians were using rockets and artillery on residential areas.
“Every 30 minutes, airplanes fly over the city of Mariupol, attack residential areas, kill the civilian population — the elderly, women, children,” he said.
Efforts to establish a humanitarian corridor to allow safe passage out for Mariupol’s civilians have repeatedly failed because of Russian fire, according to Ukrainian officials.

Despite the deadly risk of doing so, more than 2.5 million Ukrainians have now fled their country, the United Nations said. Most have gone to Poland, which has so far welcomed them but also is pleading for international aid in accommodating and processing the refugees.
The main prize for Russia remains Kyiv, where satellite photography showed that a massive armored convoy, long stalled north of the city, has begun to split up and move into villages and forests. Some analysts contend that the troops are shifting artillery into firing positions.
Kirby said he didn’t want to “make too much” of the satellite imagery, and he suggested the Russians could be moving into tree lines to avoid attacks from Ukrainian forces.
Russian troops appeared Friday to be locking down part of the expanse of villages and towns northeast of Kyiv. In the town of Pryluky, about 80 miles east of Kyiv and once home to Ukraine’s largest airfield in the Soviet era, Ukrainian soldiers were laying mines on a road into the city. Russian troops, they said, were about 30 miles northwest of the town.

Ukrainian troops in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, dig in as a long column of Russian tanks advances toward them. They vow to fight to the end.


The Ukrainian military’s top command said its troops halted Russian efforts to take the northern city of Chernihiv. Ukrainian troops recaptured the nearby town of Baklanova Muraviika, which Russian troops could use as a staging post to move toward Kyiv.
Russian forces are also blockading Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, and pushing their offensive in the south around Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Zelensky.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that thousands of “volunteers” from all over the world, especially the Middle East, have asked to join the fight against Ukraine. Many are believed to be arriving from Syria, where Moscow long supported the brutal and ultimately successful campaign of President Bashar Assad to vanquish domestic opposition as well as the Islamic State terrorist group.
“We consider it right to respond positively to [the] requests, especially since these requests are not for money, but at the true desire of these people,” Shoigu said at a meeting of the Russian Security Council, according to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.

The Times’ Marcus Yam, no stranger to war photography, gives a first-person account from Ukraine.

Zelensky, who has been defiant in rallying his people, remained determined.
“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said in a video shot outdoors in Kyiv and released Friday.
He cited the escape of 7,144 Ukrainians who made it out of the country despite Russian attacks.
“And these are 7,144 reasons to try to organize evacuations for Ukrainians from the besieged cities tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,” Zelensky said.
Later, in another video message, he accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of Melitopol, a city that Russian forces were swiftly occupying.
Russian strategy should be “equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists,” he said, referring to Islamic State. It is a “new stage of terror” in which the Russians are “trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities.”
Russia also was granted a meeting Friday at the U.N. Security Council to discuss what it claims are “the military biological activities of the U.S. on the territory of Ukraine.” U.S. diplomats scoffed at the move, saying it was an attempt to “gaslight the world.”
Pentagon and State Department officials have expressed growing concern over Russia’s motives for disinformation campaigns.
“This is exactly the kind of false-flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,” said Olivia Dalton, a spokesperson for the U.S. delegation at the U.N.
The U.S. has flatly rejected Russian accusations that Ukraine is running chemical and biological labs with U.S. support. The Pentagon put out a long list of what it described as legitimate “peaceful and safe biological detection and diagnostic capabilities” that it has been working on with Ukraine since 2005. This includes the development of vaccines and methods to fight disease in livestock, the Pentagon said.
Asked about the possibility of a chemical or biological attack from Russia, Biden said: “Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons.”
And in another twist in the propaganda war, the Russian general prosecutor’s office on Friday petitioned a Russian court for Meta — Facebook’s parent company — to be counted as an extremist organization after the company said it would allow speech such as “death to the Russian invaders.”
“Such actions by the company’s management not only form an idea of the permissibility of terrorist activities, but are also aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards the citizens of the Russian Federation,” the prosecutor’s office said, according to the official Russian news agency Tass.
The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin again floated the idea of negotiations with Ukraine despite several rounds of talks so far achieving next to nothing. Ukraine says that Russia will accept nothing less than its surrender. Ukraine is demanding a cease-fire.

Vice President Kamala Harris visits former Soviet satellites Poland and Romania to reassure them of U.S., NATO protection and support on refugees.

“No one rules out the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.
At the same time, Peskov said that “first, delegations and ministers need to do their part of the work to make sure that the presidents don’t meet just for the sake of the process and a conversation but hold a meeting to achieve results.”
But the U.S. was highly skeptical. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia so far is engaging in a “pretense of diplomacy” with no genuine interest in negotiating.
“Putin could choose to cut his losses, extricate himself from this strategic morass by seeking to negotiate in good faith a diplomatic agreement with Ukraine,” Price said. Instead, “the Kremlin continues to spread outright lies,” such as claiming the bombing of the maternity hospital was “fake news.”

Tatiana Perebeinis, 43, and her children, Nikita, 18, and Alise, 9, were killed along with a volunteer who was helping them flee the war in Ukraine.

“This is from a government that is now using many measures to hide the truth from its own people,” Price said.
Harris, who wrapped up a trip to Warsaw on Friday, pledged an additional $53 million in humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees in Poland. She met with a small group of refugees Thursday.
“We are here to support you,” she told the group. “And you are not alone. And I know there’s so much about the experience that you’ve had that has made you feel alone.”
Polish President Andrzej Duda warned Harris that an international “refugee crisis” was soon going to explode into a “refugee disaster.”
And another looming disaster could hit food supplies worldwide because Ukraine and Russia are among the planet’s top exporters of grain, fertilizer and other agricultural commodities, the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said. The FAO projects that, if the war continues, the number of undernourished people in the world will increase by up to 13 million people by 2023.

The prime ministers of Britain and Poland were in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the prime minister of Hungary, also a NATO member, met with Putin in the Kremlin.
Here are things to know Tuesday about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine, which has an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed along its borders.
What message Boris Johnson bring to Kyiv?
The British prime minister told Zelensky the Russian military buildup is “perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility toward Ukraine in our lifetimes.” Asked whether the U.K. were exaggerating the threat from Russia, he said: “That is not the intelligence we are seeing. This is a clear and present danger.”

Opinion
Western powers act as though war with Russia is inevitable, but Volodymyr Zelensky remains a voice of reason.

Johnson said the U.K. has a package of measures, including sanctions, ready to go “the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory.”
But Johnson said he still believed it was possible that Russia would choose a path of diplomacy. He was scheduled to speak with Putin on Wednesday.

What does Putin want?
Putin said the U.S. and its allies have ignored Russia’s top security demands but added that Moscow is still open for more talks with the West on easing soaring tensions over Ukraine.
In his first comments in over a month about the crisis, Putin argued that it’s possible to negotiate an end to the standoff if the concerns of all parties, including Russia’s, are taken into account.
Putin noted that the U.S. and its allies have ignored the Kremlin’s demands for guarantees that NATO won’t expand to Ukraine, won’t deploy weapons near the Russian border and will roll back its forces from Eastern Europe.
Putin spoke after talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban in the Kremlin. He said French President Emmanuel Macron may soon visit Moscow.

How is Ukraine shoring up its defenses?
Ukraine has announced a new trilateral political alliance with Britain and Poland and a decree expanding the army by 100,000 troops.
Tuesday’s announcements by Zelensky came during visits by the British and Polish prime ministers, who promised support for Ukraine.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki promised to deliver more weapons, including portable air defense systems, drones, mortars and ammunition. He noted that Russia’s neighbors feel like they are living “next to a volcano.”
Zelensky signed a decree Tuesday expanding the country’s army by 100,000 troops, bringing the total number to 350,000 in the next three years, and raising army wages.

What are the U.S. and Europe doing against potential cyberattacks?
A top White House cybersecurity official is in Europe meeting with U.S. allies to help coordinate efforts to defend against and respond to potential cyberattacks launched by Russia against Ukraine and others.
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, is traveling to Brussels and Warsaw during a week-long trip to meet with NATO allies, senior Biden administration officials said Tuesday.
The purpose of the trip is to ensure that the U.S. and its allies are prepared for all cyber-related contingencies if the situation in Ukraine were to escalate, officials said.
Russia has launched significant cyberattacks against Ukraine previously and would almost certainly do so again as part of any operation against its neighbor. Such hostile activity against Ukraine could spread far and wide, as the devastating NotPetya attack did in 2017.

What would a Ukrainian resistance look like?
The eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv is divided between people who are enthusiastically volunteering to join a civil resistance to a potential Russian invasion and those who just want to live their lives.
Which side wins out in Kharkiv, which is Ukraine’s second-largest city and is just 25 miles from where Russian troops are massing, could well determine the fate of the country.
A guerrilla war fought by dentists, coaches and housewives defending a hometown with 1,000 basement shelters would be a nightmare for Russian military planners, according to both analysts and U.S. intelligence officials. And that’s exactly what many people in Kharkiv — and across Ukraine — say they’re planning to do.
“Both our generation and our children are ready to defend themselves. This will not be an easy war,” said Maryna Tseluiko, a 40-year-old baker who signed up as a reservist with her 18-year-old daughter in Kyiv.

Why does Russia say it didn’t send a real response to U.S. proposal?
Russia says the U.S. misinterpreted a request for clarification as their response to an American proposal aimed at deescalating the Ukraine crisis.
Multiple Biden administration officials said the Russian government had provided a written response to the U.S. proposals, but Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko on Tuesday told Russia’s state RIA Novosti news agency that this was “not true.”
The agency also cited an unnamed senior diplomat in the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sent a message to his Western colleagues, including U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken, about “the principle of indivisibility of security,” but said it wasn’t a response to Washington’s proposals.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday there has been “confusion” — Russia’s response to the U.S. proposals is still in the works, and what was sent “were other considerations on a somewhat different issue.”

We were at a popular park on the Black Sea. A long line of Ukrainians — maybe 50 — were at a booth where T-shirts, snacks and newspapers were being sold. People were there for the newspapers.
Even back then, this was a remarkable sight. Americans weren’t lining up for newspapers three decades ago and certainly aren’t these days.
Ukrainians were grabbing up newspapers because their parliament had just — on July 16, 1990 — declared the nation’s independence from the Soviet Union.
They couldn’t read enough about it. This was their July 4, 1776.
But there were no fireworks. No high-fives. Not even much talk. It was eerily quiet. People sat at picnic tables, on benches or on the grass immersed in a paper. Their faces showed confusion and concern.
You could see them thinking: “Now what?” “How does this affect me?” “What will the Russians do?”
World & Nation
Russian troops bear down on Kyiv and continue their thrust into Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. Putin puts nuclear forces on alert.

It took a while, but they began to get an answer 24 years later when Russia “annexed” — seized — Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

The full answer came last Thursday when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a brutish attack on Ukraine by land, sea and air.
In Odessa, people awoke to exploding missiles. Russian troops and tanks moved north from the Crimea. In the Black Sea, where our cruise ship had sailed placidly in 1990, foreign commercial vessels reported being hit by bombs and missiles.
It reminds us of the difference a national leader can make. In 1990, Russia was led by a friendly reformer, Mikhail Gorbachev. Now, it’s being dangerously steered off course by a Soviet throwback bully.
The collapse of the Soviet Union and emergence of democracies in Eastern Europe was an exciting time in the 1990s and early 2000s — especially for American political consultants and activists who were drawn to the struggle for democratization.
One such political junkie was Sean Garrett, a 24-year-old press aide for Gov. Pete Wilson.
Garrett’s birth mother was a Lithuanian immigrant and he’d always been curious about his roots. So in 1992 he wrangled a job helping the pro-democracy side in Lithuania’s second free election.
“Everyone in the governor’s office thought I was insane,” Garrett, now 54, recalled last week.
Garrett became an instant celebrity in Lithuania.
“Not only was I from America, I was from California,” he told me later. “For them, California meant the ultimate dream — Hollywood, beaches ….
Politics
Russian President Putin seems willing to sacrifice so much to occupy Ukraine. It is part of his attempt to rebuild a Russian empire loyal, essentially, to him.

“The easiest way to get a laugh was to tell them that California now had problems, and that Californians didn’t like California so much anymore. They’d just start laughing. They couldn’t grasp it. They were cold, hungry, out of work, out of gasoline.”
Garrett constantly urged democracy advocates to keep their message simple. One day he provided an example. At a rock concert, he suddenly was asked to address the 5,000 young people there.
“I walked out,” he recalled, “and said, ‘I’ve got one question for the future of Lithuania: Do you want Lenin, or do you want Levi’s?
“They went nuts. ‘Levi’s. Levi’s.’”
Four years later, Garrett worked in Ukraine helping people adjust to a free market economy.
But for most of his career, he has been a public relations consultant for Bay Area tech firms.
“A lot of people who have only been to Western Europe still think of Eastern Europe as a Soviet bloc,” Garrett says. “If you’ve been to Paris or Munich, you’ve been to Ukraine. It’s very European.”
In 1996, three top Wilson strategists were hired covertly to help Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin win reelection. His image was in the dumpster. But being Americans, they couldn’t be seen working with the Kremlin leader. So, they secretly dealt with his influential 36-year-old daughter.
Yeltsin beat a hard-core communist.
“You’re dealing with the oligarchs in Russia,” lead strategist George Gorton later recalled. “It can be frightening. … I was very happy to get out in one piece.”
Before he ran Arnold Schwarzenegger’s successful 2003 recall campaign that toppled Gov. Gray Davis, consultant Mike Murphy worked for capitalist causes in Romania and Georgia.
In Romania, he scrounged up money for a newspaper backing the opposition so it could bribe a nightwatchman to obtain a railroad car full of newsprint. The government was blocking the paper’s access to it.
In Georgia, he advised pro-democracy candidates running against a Russian-backed party.
“Western consultants rely on mass communication, persuasion and organizing,” he says. “Russians just tell the head of the railroad to call in everyone for emergency work on election day so they can’t vote. We put up a negative TV ad in Georgia, and they just turned off the power. Pretty slick.”
As for Putin, “at the end of this he’ll be a pariah,” Murphy says. “Putin may win a few military battles, but he’s going into a quagmire. He’s delusional.”
For one, Russia’s economy is only half the size of California’s.
State budget nerds in Sacramento are trying to assess what financial effect the war and sanctions will have on California.
“It won’t amount to a hill of beans for the fifth-largest economy in the world,” says finance department spokesman H.D. Palmer.
“Both Ukraine and Russia are relatively small trading partners. Russia constitutes 0.3% of California’s total exports and 0.5% of imports.”
It’s a given gas prices will rise.
Murphy’s right: Putin will score short-term military wins, but in the long run he’ll be branded a loser — a power-mad thug who brutalized a neighbor and threw his own country under the avtobus.
Odessans will love reading about it in their newspaper."

There is no palatable decision here. I am just glad we have calm reasonable leaders who won’t be swayed by emotion and continue to seek a way through this horrible period of inhumanity.

To the editor: I’m amazed, though maybe I shouldn’t be, that some readers actually think getting involved in a war with someone threatening to use nuclear weapons is acceptable.
If these readers just don’t care about what nuclear fallout may occur, they should consider that some people aren’t ready to die a miserable death from radiation poisoning.

To the editor: A letter writer asked the preposterous question with regard to Russia, “Is our propaganda machine so different?” The answer couldn’t be more obvious.
In America, information is not the monopoly of a single source. It’s not dominated by the government.

Those who express disagreement with the government do not automatically and immediately end up in jail. The leader of the opposition party in the U.S. doesn’t meet the same fate as Alexei Navalny, poisoned and then sent to jail for years.
It’s one thing to criticize America. It’s quite another to ignorantly equate the U.S. with places where people can only dream about our freedoms.

It is Saturday, June 4.

Claims that five SDSU football players raped a girl were followed by months of silence. Claims spread among San Diego State athletes last year that five football players had raped an unconscious girl at a house party off campus. “I am very scared and worried that nothing is being done about this,” one student-athlete told university officials in a message sent through an anonymous reporting system. The university said it held off investigating at the request of police, who say their inquiry into the alleged October incident involving a minor is ongoing.
Even with less severe illness, California’s new coronavirus wave is still disrupting lives. The surge is taking shape as California slogs into a third pandemic summer with far fewer hospitalizations and deaths but still significant disruptions. Some schools, including UCLA, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Berkeley’s K-12 public schools, have reinstituted indoor mask mandates, and concerns are growing that hospitals may soon be asked to care for larger numbers of coronavirus-positive patients. Alameda County issued a new mask mandate in most indoor public settings that took effect Friday, and L.A. County moved closer to a possible mask requirement later this month.
Despite a state law, more than half of California community colleges have refused to drop dead-end remedial courses. The 2019 law requires the colleges to direct students away from remedial education — which often does not count toward degree or transfer credits. But more than half of the state’s 116 campuses have not made the change. Advocates who want to largely do away with remedial education in California and in a handful of other states say many students can handle college-level work if given the opportunity, especially when they get help from tutors or supplemental classes.
Asian Americans are stereotyped as successful students, but a new report found “incredibly disconcerting” gaps. The report detailed stark differences in academic achievement among California’s Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups, including qualification for UC and Cal State admission, completion of community college degree or certificate programs and attainment of bachelor’s degrees. The failure to recognize various challenges faced by subgroups has led to an assumption that they have few problems and to their “invisibility” in many equity conversations, said an official with a college advocacy organization.
Asian Latino families represent California’s future. California is home to more Asian Latinos than any other state in the U.S. — at least 250,000. But that’s still a tiny slice of the nearly 40 million people who reside in the Golden State. As the Asian and Latino populations continue to grow, mixed offspring will become increasingly common. They offer a glimpse of California and the nation’s future, with all its complexities of language, culture and identity.
Some water districts in L.A. and Ventura counties say watering restrictions could increase the threat of wildfire. They’re asking state water officials to allocate more water under the health and safety exception for drought rules, using the rationale that it should include the mitigation of wildfire risk. But some drought and wildfire experts question the wisdom of such a move. They say the best strategy for reducing wildfire risk is to build fire-hardened homes and clear large areas of defensible space around structures.

$8.05 for a gallon of regular at an L.A. gas station. Say what? There are many reasons why California has higher average gas prices, including more stringent clean energy regulations, inflation and Russia’s war against Ukraine.
A long-dead proposal to flood a bucolic valley north of Sacramento for a massive reservoir for thirsty Southern California is finding new life amid the effects of climate change and worsening drought. The plan is also meeting with stiff opposition. The Sites Reservoir project, conceived in the 1950s, was abandoned in the 1980s, the twilight years of America’s big Western dam-building projects. Now, a Southwestern megadrought and historic water restrictions in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties are fueling renewed interest in the plan, much to the dismay of environmentalists.
There’s suspense in California’s June 7 primary. You just have to hunt for it. Among down-ballot races are contests that could sway the balance of power in Congress and the future of state criminal justice policies. Among the more intriguing twists in statewide races is the emergence of candidates shunning affiliation with any political party, including a top candidate for California attorney general. Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert, a career prosecutor who shed her GOP registration in 2018 and switched to “no party preference,” hopes to finish in the top two in the primary. If successful, Schubert would face off in November against Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, a Newsom appointee known for his liberal stance on criminal justice.
Does California have enough water for lots of new homes? Yes, experts say. To some, though, it may defy logic. California is in the middle of a punishing drought, yet many of the same elected officials urging water conservation are pushing for the construction of millions of new homes. But experts say there is plenty of water available for new Californians if the 60-year trend of residents using less water continues and accelerates into the future.

They want to rebuild Greenville, Calif., so that it survives the next wildfire. The Dixie fire — the second-largest wildfire in California history — decimated the town of about 1,000 people. The Dixie Fire Collaborative has embarked on a multi-stage process to gather community input and create an architectural plan for the downtown. Above all, they say, they want to ensure a tragedy on this scale will never happen here again. “Most people want to go fast,” said Sue Weber, a former nun and co-chair of the collaborative. “Just to rebuild back as opposed to really stopping and really intentionally looking at what’s the best way to build back that’s healthy and helpful for everybody.”
A far-right insurrection aims to take over this Northern California county, at the ballot box. Far-right activists, including members of a local militia, led a successful recall campaign in February against a Republican Shasta County supervisor. Now the newly formed “Liberty Committee” is backing an all-male election slate to further consolidate power. The group’s website declares that “our country is under assault. It’s time to take it back, one state, county and city at a time.” The election is being watched as a harbinger of rising radicalism in local government, particularly because the recall contingent has touted its playbook as a national model.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 war crimes have been alleged across the country, with 200 to 300 more being reported daily, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.

Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
The losses caused by the Russian occupation - now ended - are put at more than 1.6bn hryvnia (£44m; $54m).
The explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl spread radiation across Europe in 1986.
The decommissioned plant, north of Kyiv, lies near the Belarus border and was quickly occupied by Russian troops after their 24 February invasion.
Russian forces controlled the plant for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March.
A team from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has just ended a visit to Chernobyl and its surrounding 2,700sq km (1,040sq mile) exclusion zone.
An IAEA statement says they ""provided support to their Ukrainian counterparts on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security"".
Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate has confirmed to the BBC that the Chernobyl site's radiation level is currently safe.
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.
In April the agency said the Russians had plundered two labs at Chernobyl, stealing sources of ionising radiation.
Mr Medved told the BBC that Russian soldiers had stolen ""computer monitors, hard drives and software"". ""We're still checking the losses... [it's] more than 1,000 units, and whatever they didn't steal they broke.""
Some removed spare wheels from their armoured personnel carriers so that they could carry away more looted equipment, he said. Construction and firefighting vehicles were stolen, he said, without giving a figure.
The Russian military has also been accused of looting elsewhere in Ukraine, but has not commented on the reports. It denies indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas.
Chernobyl acting director-general Valeriy Seyda says the plant's losses amount to more than 1.6bn hryvnia. He says operations have resumed there safely. The staff, with help from the IAEA, have to monitor the dormant reactors closely and run scientific tests.
The Russian troops smashed up and looted Chernobyl's workshops, labs and offices, Mr Seyda said.
Their negligence of safety rules, he said, ""caused some deterioration in [the] radiation situation"" which, he added, has been mitigated.
Ukraine has now de-mined the area and disposed of ammunition left behind, Mr Seyda said. Repairs have begun on the damaged facilities, he said, but it is now urgent to ensure safe operations for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.
Mr Medved said staff living in Slavutych, a town near the site, had previously commuted easily by train. ""But now the bridges are blown, there is no direct route, they have to go by bus via Kyiv.""
And he said the whereabouts of 196 Ukrainian soldiers taken prisoner by the Russians at Chernobyl were still unknown.
Ukraine now has eight reactors connected to the grid - two at the Zaporizhzhia power station, which is under Russian occupation, three at Rivne, two at the South Ukraine power station and one at Khmelnytskyy. Its seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve.Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.

A plume of smoke a few kilometres away confirms the hit - another rocket.
We are following a Ukrainian Red Cross van as they try to rescue some of those coming under regular shelling: yet another busload to add to the already historic human exodus from this country.
These farewells have become a familiar sight across Ukraine over the last 100 days, but they are no less heartbreaking to watch.
Liudmyla has decided it is time for her youngest children to leave. She can't let them play outside as the bombardment continues and she wants them to be somewhere safe.
She holds on to them as long as she can, one under each arm, until it is time to go. Then it is too much. She turns her back and sobs as they leave.
""I will see them again when the bombing stops,"" she tells me. But no-one knows when that will be.
Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces came close to the city limits but were pushed back.
This region is key to Russian's strategy to cut off the entire southern coast. A breakthrough here would allow the Kremlin's forces to approach Odesa - the country's largest civilian port, 130 km (80 miles) to the west.
Vladimir Putin could then complete his land bridge up to Transnistria, the breakaway republic of Moldova.
Russian attacks have stepped up in recent weeks, prompting fears that if the Kremlin prevails in Donbas, it will then concentrate its forces in the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv.
The city governor, Vitaliy Kim, tells me that the recent air attacks in the south have been aimed at Ukrainian counter-offensives.
""Mykoliav, like Kherson, like Mariupol, is a trigger point for the Russians,"" he said.
""They are disappointed that we are counter-attacking. We have the motivation and the will to win. This is our land and we will do our best.""
He is standing outside his former office, the regional administration building, which was ripped apart by a cruise missile in March, killing 36 people.
Earlier this week, two people were killed when the Russians shelled an apartment block and a playground.
Mr Kim is aware of the risks of staying. ""I don't know what it is any more to live a normal life. I wish very much to end the war but I can't.
""For now, we have only one purpose. And everything, every human resource, money, time is spent only for victory.""
This city has proved to be remarkably resilient.
Water is a precious resource - supplies were cut off after Russia seized the neighbouring city of Kherson. Queues to fill bottles are often long and June temperatures are hitting around 30C.
And yet people here have managed to find a way to make it work. They fill up their containers from local stations set up in neighbourhoods.
The daily thud of incoming shells barely registers. Most hardly look up from their coffee as they sit on benches in the park. There is even a horse and Cinderella-like carriage with courting couples merrily trundling up and down the High Street.
This may be a Kremlin target, but it is also home.
We head 30 km (19 miles) south to a village near the frontline to see the path of Russia's retreat in March.
Dozens of families have returned since the invading forces were pushed back. The village head, Natalia Panashii, is keen to show me what they've done with the bomb craters.
""Look, I've turned them into flower beds,"" she tells me proudly.
""Thank God, we are holding on. Sometimes I am very scared that they might just kidnap me and take me away. On the other hand, I am sure, and I keep telling this to everyone else, that they have no business here. They should know better than loitering on our land.""
""Yes, we are concerned that the Russians might go on an offensive, very concerned. But we believe that the victory is going to be ours.""
We hear what I am told are cluster bombs being launched just a few kilometres away, so I question Natalia's optimism.
""Yes, even with that thumping,"" she said.
""We think that those thuds are just because some drunk Russian is firing to scare us. But he is failing at that.""
Natalia has lived for the last 100 days in both defiance and dread.
She admits to me that she will sit down and have a cry when I leave.
It makes me want to sit with her a little longer, but she waves me off with some Ukrainian biscuits.
As I head to the car, I notice the roads surrounding the village are still marked by the tracks of Russian tanks. Natalia points at them and shakes her head. ""No, no, no,"" she says.

On day 101 of the war, Ukraine said Russia was doing everything it could to take control of the key eastern city of Severodonetsk.
""The Russian army is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor.
The city has seen extremely fierce fighting in recent days as Russian troops try to take control of the entire Luhansk region - one of two regions which make up the part of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas.
Mr Haidai said earlier that Ukrainian forces had managed to retake some of Severodonetsk from Russian forces, adding that Russia had suffered huge losses.
The Russian bombardment of the city has been compared to the battle of Mariupol, which was all but destroyed by a relentless Russian assault.
The BBC's Joe Inwood explains why Severodonetsk has both a symbolic and military significance.
Elsewhere in the Donbas, fighting sparked a major fire at a famous wooden monastery - the Sviatohirsk Lavra Monastery in the Donetsk region.
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church said the flames had engulfed the monastery's main shrine.
""Another crime of Russian barbarians for whom there is nothing sacred,"" Ukrainian army officer, Yurii Kochevenko, said on Facebook.
A Ukrainian government tweet shows the fine old monastery intact, before it was hit.
Russia blamed Ukrainian ""nationalist"" troops for setting fire to the building. Read more about the monastery fire here.
Russia's focus on the Donbas does not mean the shelling has stopped in other parts of the country.
To the south, the important Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv was one of the first cities attacked when the invasion began. Russian forces were pushed back from the city limits.
But there is still shelling every day there, and if Russia accomplishes its goal of capturing the Donbas it could refocus its efforts to the south and try once again to take Mykolaiv.
Despite the constant danger, residents of the region remain defiant.
""Thank God, we are holding on... they [the Russians] should know better than loitering on our land,"" Natalia Panashii told the BBC's Laura Bicker on a recent visit.
You can read Laura's report from Mykolaiv here.
French President Emmanuel Macron landed himself in hot water with many Ukrainians on Saturday as he attempted to position France as a potential mediator in the war.
""We must not humiliate Russia,"" he told French media, so that ""when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means.""
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba quickly responded: ""Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it.
""It is Russia that humiliates itself.""
The war, particularly in the south, has had a devastating effect on Ukraine's ability to export food products from its Black Sea ports.
Kyiv and its allies say Moscow has imposed a naval blockade which prevents ships from operating in the region. Ukraine has also mined the coast to prevent a Russian amphibious assault.
The resulting shortage of products has driven up the price of staple foods like wheat around the world. That's why the head of the African Union, Macky Sall, has described African countries as innocent victims of the war.
More than 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine.
Mr Sall was visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
As he directs the fighting from the gleaming white halls of the Kremlin, what does Vladimir Putin make of the swirling Western debates over how best to support Ukraine, and the extent to which Russia should be punished?
In one corner, he sees governments in Britain, Poland and the Baltics calling for his unambiguous defeat.
""We need to make sure that Russia is driven out of Ukraine by the Ukrainians,"" the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week.
""There can't be any compromising over Ukrainian territory.""
But in the other corner, Mr Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach.
Speaking in early May, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, called for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and urged the West not to ""give in to the temptation of humiliation, nor the spirit of revenge"".
The following day, Italy's Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, speaking at the White House, said people in Europe wanted ""to think about the possibility of bringing a ceasefire and starting again some credible negotiations"".
After Mr Macron and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone call with Mr Putin on Saturday, aimed at exploring ways to enable Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, Latvia's deputy prime minister lashed out on social media.
""It seems that there are a number of so-called Western leaders who possess the explicit need for self-humiliation, in combination with a total detachment from political reality,"" Artis Pabriks tweeted.
Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin.
But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for regime change in Moscow, but also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
The former Prime Minister and President Dmitry Medvedev called that statement ""rational."" But the US decision announced on Wednesday to send a more advanced rocket system to Ukraine was described by the Kremlin as ""adding fuel to the fire"".
With the US president prone to speak off the cuff, it generally falls to his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, to deliver the administration's considered position.
At a recent Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin, Mr Blinken said the US and its partners were ""focussed on giving Ukraine as strong a hand as possible on the battlefield, and at any negotiating table, so that it can repel Russian aggression and fully defend its independence and sovereignty"".
Strong words, but how exactly do you define ""as strong a hand as possible""? And what does ""fully"" defending Ukraine's independence and sovereignty actually mean?
So are cracks beginning to break up the veneer of Western consensus on Ukraine?
""You only have to look at the struggle to get the oil embargo,"" says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform, referring to the tortured weeks of negotiation that resulted in this week's partial EU embargo on Russian oil.
Any notion that the EU will move swiftly on to Russian gas has already been dispelled. The Baltic states and Poland would like this to happen quickly, but Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, admitted this week that ""all the next sanctions will be more difficult"".
Austria's chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said a gas embargo ""will not be an issue in the next sanctions package"".
The West has promised much, Kyiv argues, but delivered less.
This week's American and German promises to supply advanced multiple rocket artillery and air defence and radar systems will certainly have gone some way towards meeting the urgent demands of hard-pressed Ukrainian commanders.
But allegations of German foot-dragging over previous commitments and Joe Biden's insistence that US weapons only be used to hit Russian targets inside Ukraine cause some to wonder why the West seeks to place limits on Ukraine's war effort while Russia observes no limits at all.
""There's a kind of calibration going on,"" says Ian Bond. ""As though we're saying 'we want the Ukrainians to win but not to win too much'"".
It's widely believed that Mr Putin launched this war confident that the West would lack the stomach for a fight. That Nato members, fresh from their humiliating exit from Afghanistan, would shy away from a new international imbroglio.
Some recent reports from Moscow suggest a creeping confidence, engendered by gradual battlefield success and the belief, in the words of one source quoted by the Meduza website, that ""sooner or later, Europe will tire of helping.""
The Kremlin may have taken heart from this week's British government warning that as many as six million British households could face power cuts if Russia shuts off gas supplies this winter.
Could public anger in the West undermine support for Ukraine?
It's a danger the US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, spelled out to members of Congress last month.
""He [Putin] is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,"" she told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ""as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.""
For all the anxieties about self-inflicted wounds and the hesitation surrounding the supply of weapons, the Western consensus over Ukraine remains remarkably intact.
But the cracks that exist could still widen.
""If either side begins to make decisive gains, then they become more of a problem,"" says Ian Bond.
""If the Russians completely break through Ukrainian lines in the east and start heading for the Dnieper River, the question of how much territory Ukraine should be willing to sacrifice to achieve a ceasefire is going to move up the agenda.""
By the same token, if Ukrainian forces start driving the Russians back, Ian Bond says, ""there will be voices in the West saying 'don't try and recapture parts of the Donbas that the Russians have controlled since 2014'.""
It's not a debate that seems terribly relevant just yet, but when the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger suggested at Davos that Ukraine should consider ceding territory in order to make peace with Russia, he met with a furious response in Ukraine and beyond.
A sign of anguished debates that still lie ahead.With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
As he directs the fighting from the gleaming white halls of the Kremlin, what does Vladimir Putin make of the swirling Western debates over how best to support Ukraine, and the extent to which Russia should be punished?
In one corner, he sees governments in Britain, Poland and the Baltics calling for his unambiguous defeat.
""We need to make sure that Russia is driven out of Ukraine by the Ukrainians,"" the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week.
""There can't be any compromising over Ukrainian territory.""

African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering, the head of the African Union has told Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Russia.
After talks in Sochi, Macky Sall said the Russian leader had promised to ease the export of cereals and fertiliser, but gave no details.
Mr Putin denied Moscow was preventing Ukrainian ports from exporting grain.
Over 40% of wheat consumed in Africa usually comes from Russia and Ukraine.
But Ukraine's ports in the Black Sea have been largely blocked for exports since the conflict began. Kyiv and its allies blame Moscow for blockading the ports, which Ukraine has mined to prevent a Russian amphibious assault.
""Failure to open those ports will result in famine,"" the UN's crisis coordinator Amin Awad said in Geneva.
He said a grain shortage could affect 1.4 billion people and trigger mass migration.
The war has exacerbated already existing shortages in Africa caused by bad harvests and insecurity.
Food prices have shot up across the continent since Russia invaded Ukraine 100 days ago, pushing huge numbers towards hunger.
The head of the World Food Programme, Mike Dunford, said more than 80 million people were acutely food insecure, acutely hungry in Africa - up from about 50 million people this time last year.
Chad has declared a national food emergency. A third of the population needs food aid, according to the UN and the government has appealed for international assistance.
Mr Sall, who is Senegal's president, told Mr Putin he should be ""aware that our countries, even if they are far from the theatre [of action], are victims of this economic crisis"".
He said he was also pleading on behalf of other countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
Mr Putin said Russia was ready to guarantee the safe export of Ukrainian grain via ports on the Azov and Black seas it controls. He said the best solution would be to lift sanctions on Belarus, a close Russian ally, so the grain could be shipped that way.
Some analysts argue the Kremlin is hoping that a looming food crisis will put political pressure on the West by provoking big new refugee flows towards Europe from food-insecure countries in the Middle East and Africa.
Before Friday's meeting, Mr Putin said he was always on the side of Africa, but didn't explicitly mention the continent's food crisis.
Like many African countries, Senegal has avoided taking sides in the conflict and the Senegalese leader also said food supplies should be ""outside"" the West's sanctions on Russia. He said he had made this point when he spoke to the European Council earlier in the week.
Last Friday, US President Joe Biden dismissed the idea that the West bore responsibility for the global price rises.
""This is a Putin price hike. Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major bread baskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world,"" he said.African countries are innocent victims of the war in Ukraine and Russia should help ease their suffering, the head of the African Union has told Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Russia.

The Marriott hotel chain has announced it is leaving Russia after 25 years, saying Western restrictions made it ""impossible"" to keep operating there.
The company closed its Moscow office and paused investment in Russia in March, following the invasion of Ukraine.

But in a statement, it said: ""We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market.""
The company said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict.

It's been 98 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and events on the ground remain complex and fast-moving.
Moscow's forces have been pushed back from the capital city of Kyiv, and the troops dispatched by Vladimir Putin towards the second city of Kharkiv have been forced across the border back into Russia - but intense fighting continues.
Our correspondents on the ground have been answering your questions about how the war is progressing and whether Ukraine can survive the Russian onslaught. They are:
David Perdue, in Washington DC, asks: Has Russia's ground offensive practically stalled? What further Ukrainian territory will Russia look to occupy, if any?
After initial setbacks, Russian troops seem to be making gains in eastern Ukraine. But what's Moscow's objective? If Russia occupies the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, will the Kremlin stop or push on for more territory?
Even if Russia does call a halt, there's no guarantee it would be a permanent cessation of hostilities. They say a leopard doesn't change its spots… neither, I suspect, would Russia's president.
In speeches and articles Vladimir Putin has made it clear that he does not see Ukraine as a sovereign nation; instead he views it as a territory that belongs historically in Moscow's orbit.
After launching his ""special military operation"", the Kremlin leader seems to have expected the government in Kyiv to fall quickly. He even called on the Ukrainian military to rise up and overthrow the Ukrainian leadership. That didn't happen.
But that doesn't mean Vladimir Putin has given up on the idea of forcing Ukraine back into Moscow's sphere of influence - even in the face of Western sanctions.
This question comes from SC Bhargava: Why is it that Ukraine has been mostly defensive? Why has it not attacked military and civilian targets inside Russia?
This is a war Ukraine did not choose and did not start. It's defensive in its very nature: the country is fighting for its right to exist against an all-out Russian attack.
I don't think you can underestimate what it has cost Ukraine to stop Russia taking Kyiv, and now to try and halt the advance of Russian troops across the Donbas.
Openly and deliberately targeting Russia itself would be a major escalation at a time when Ukraine is battling to hold the line.
The pleas from Kyiv for more weapons from the West are constant. But the US recently made very clear that the longer-range missiles it will provide are not for hitting Russian territory: it fears an escalation.
Remember, the West judged it too risky to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine when Kyiv was begging for that at the start. As for Ukraine targeting Russian civilians? That would be a war crime.
Isobel McRae-Morris asks about reports that some Russian soldiers have been refusing to fight in Ukraine, with some conscripts deserting their positions. Is this really happening?
Yes, although it's hard to know the scale. The thing is, Russia hasn't officially declared war: Vladimir Putin insists on calling his invasion a ""special operation"" and that means professional soldiers can refuse to take part. They can be fired, but they can't - or shouldn't - be prosecuted.
Still, it takes some guts to actually do it. From my own reporting in Ukraine, I know that many of the Russian soldiers deployed at the start of this invasion were young and inexperienced; some didn't know they were going to war, others thought they'd take Kyiv in days, without resistance.
But the proof of heavy battles and heavy losses is everywhere, including in the refrigerated train carriages I've seen piled up with dead Russian soldiers. So it doesn't surprise me that some would refuse to fight, especially now they've seen for themselves that Ukraine doesn't want ""liberating"". But we're not seeing reports of mass desertion.
Philip Withers asks: Why has Nato not moved to protect the Black Sea port of Odesa, given that the Black Sea is international waters?
There are lots of complicated reasons for this.
Firstly, Nato is not directly involved in the conflict and wants to keep it that way.
Second, the Montreux Convention, which regulates maritime access to the Black Sea, gives Turkey a say over which non-Black Sea states are allowed to pass in and out through the Bosphorus.
Turkey has much closer relations with Moscow than almost all other Nato members (with the exception of Hungary) and wants to be seen as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. Any move to forcibly break Russia's blockade of Odesa would inevitably be seen by Moscow as a hostile move.
Britain and Lithuania recently indicated that they wanted to see a ""coalition of the willing"" to protect commercial shipping in and out of Odesa, in an effort to allow Ukraine to export its badly needed agricultural products, especially grain, around the world. But plans have yet to take shape.
In the meantime, a Danish decision to supply Ukraine with American-made Harpoon missiles, combined with Ukraine's own Neptune system (which was responsible for sinking the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet) mean that, for now, Odesa is not likely to be attacked from the sea.
The next question comes from reader Jayesh who asks whether Russia and Ukraine are holding any peace talks at the moment on establishing a ceasefire.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine started up soon after the Russian invasion. There were several rounds of negotiations, but they didn't produce any agreement.
For now, the talking's over. Both sides blame each other for that. But remember: if Russian forces hadn't attacked Ukraine in the first place, there'd be no need for a ceasefire!
It's likely that developments on the battlefield will dictate when, how and in what format negotiations resume.
This week, President Erdogan of Turkey talked by phone with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts and offered to mediate in the conflict.
Russia's current military aim appears to be to seize and occupy (or ""liberate"" as the Russians put it) the whole of the Donbas region. Moscow may not be ready for a ceasefire until it manages that.
One reader, Johnny, writes: When are countries going to stop acting scared of Russia and stand up to them?
Are Ukraine's Western backers scared or merely acting cautiously?
Some, like the Baltic republics, have voiced frustration over what they see as the West's reluctance to give Ukraine everything it needs.
But for all Russia's military deficiencies - which have been cruelly exposed over more than three months of a frequently bungled campaign - it is still armed with a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons which it has hinted it could use.
Western officials continue to believe that Moscow is unlikely to resort to such doomsday options, but they cannot simply act as if such dangers didn't exist.
And while some, including the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seem happy to talk about expelling Russian forces from the whole of Ukraine, others see a return to the situation that existed on the morning of 24 February as a more likely and feasible scenario.
This would leave Russia in control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, as well as significant chunks of the eastern Donbas.
Lois Barakat Ichelson says: In light of new EU oil embargoes, which will be tougher by the end of the year, are the oligarchs organised, powerful and motivated enough to oust President Putin?
He goes on to ask whether there are any other groups or forces in the country that could remove him.
Considering the highly secretive nature of Kremlin politics, it's only natural that there's lots of rumour and speculation about the man at the top; after all, it's Putin who takes all key decisions in the country.
So… is Vladimir Putin seriously ill? Are the knives being sharpened ahead of a ""palace coup""? Are the oligarchs plotting to overthrow the president?
Much of this, I suspect, is wishful thinking on the part of President Putin's detractors. Of course, not everyone in the corridors of Kremlin power will be happy with what Russia's doing in Ukraine and the international sanctions Moscow has brought upon itself.
But, right now, there's no hint of an anti-Putin coup - and that includes amongst the oligarchs, whose wings the Kremlin clipped long ago.
Mind you, if you were Vladimir Putin, would you be taking any chances? That may explain why the head of the Russian National Guard is an ex-Putin bodyguard. According to Russian media reports, so, too, is Russia's new Emergencies Minister, promoted last week.It's been 98 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and events on the ground remain complex and fast-moving.

The next question comes from reader Jayesh who asks whether Russia and Ukraine are holding any peace talks at the moment on establishing a ceasefire.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine started up soon after the Russian invasion. There were several rounds of negotiations, but they didn't produce any agreement.
For now, the talking's over. Both sides blame each other for that. But remember: if Russian forces hadn't attacked Ukraine in the first place, there'd be no need for a ceasefire!
It's likely that developments on the battlefield will dictate when, how and in what format negotiations resume.
This week, President Erdogan of Turkey talked by phone with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts and offered to mediate in the conflict.
Russia's current military aim appears to be to seize and occupy (or ""liberate"" as the Russians put it) the whole of the Donbas region. Moscow may not be ready for a ceasefire until it manages that.
One reader, Johnny, writes: When are countries going to stop acting scared of Russia and stand up to them?
Are Ukraine's Western backers scared or merely acting cautiously?
Some, like the Baltic republics, have voiced frustration over what they see as the West's reluctance to give Ukraine everything it needs.
But for all Russia's military deficiencies - which have been cruelly exposed over more than three months of a frequently bungled campaign - it is still armed with a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons which it has hinted it could use.
Western officials continue to believe that Moscow is unlikely to resort to such doomsday options, but they cannot simply act as if such dangers didn't exist.
And while some, including the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seem happy to talk about expelling Russian forces from the whole of Ukraine, others see a return to the situation that existed on the morning of 24 February as a more likely and feasible scenario.
This would leave Russia in control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, as well as significant chunks of the eastern Donbas.
Lois Barakat Ichelson says: In light of new EU oil embargoes, which will be tougher by the end of the year, are the oligarchs organised, powerful and motivated enough to oust President Putin?
He goes on to ask whether there are any other groups or forces in the country that could remove him.
Considering the highly secretive nature of Kremlin politics, it's only natural that there's lots of rumour and speculation about the man at the top; after all, it's Putin who takes all key decisions in the country.
So… is Vladimir Putin seriously ill? Are the knives being sharpened ahead of a ""palace coup""? Are the oligarchs plotting to overthrow the president?
Much of this, I suspect, is wishful thinking on the part of President Putin's detractors. Of course, not everyone in the corridors of Kremlin power will be happy with what Russia's doing in Ukraine and the international sanctions Moscow has brought upon itself.
But, right now, there's no hint of an anti-Putin coup - and that includes amongst the oligarchs, whose wings the Kremlin clipped long ago.
Mind you, if you were Vladimir Putin, would you be taking any chances? That may explain why the head of the Russian National Guard is an ex-Putin bodyguard. According to Russian media reports, so, too, is Russia's new Emergencies Minister, promoted last week."

The move is intended to slow soaring inflation and prevent a further collapse of its currency following Russia's invasion in February.
Businesses have been forced to close and key supply chains have been cut off since the war began.
The World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy could shrink by as much as 45% this year.
The rate of inflation - or the cost of living - has risen to 17% in Ukraine and is on track to hit 20% this year, according to the country's central bank.
The National Bank of Ukraine said the benchmark interest rate increase - from 10% to 25% - would help protect citizens' savings from being eaten by soaring inflation.
Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has also come under heavy pressure since Russia's invasion, falling sharply in value. The central bank said it hoped the rate rise would ease some of that strain and stabilise the currency.
It is Ukraine's first rate increase since the war broke out, with the bank signalling it would move to reduce rates again once inflation was back under control.
More than $100bn of infrastructure damage to Ukrainian cities has been caused by artillery fire and airstrikes, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, while 14 million citizens have been forced to flee their homes.
To mount its military defence, and support citizens who have lost their livelihoods, the government has rapidly increased its spending, pushing the budget deficit up 27% month on month to $7.7bn in May, according to Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital.
Banks have also been forced to accept that loans made to businesses in territory now controlled by Russia will probably never be repaid, another huge financial blow to the country's economy.
""The most likely scenario is that nearly all corporate and retail loans in the territories that are still occupied will be lost,"" said Vitaliy Vavryshchuk, head of macro research at asset manager Investment Capital Ukraine.
Friday marks 100 days since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, with 4,500 civilians killed since fighting broke out. Hospitals and schools have been devastated, while ports have been blockaded, cutting Ukraine off from the exports that form the backbone of its economy.
Around 50% of the world's supply of neon gas, critical for making the microchips that power smartphones and cars, comes from just two Ukrainian companies.
In addition, more than 18% of global barley exports, 16% of corn, and 12% of wheat, come from Ukraine's fields.
""The food crisis really threatens up to 1.4 billion people that are going to experience food shortages and even famine in some places,"" Amin Awad, the UN crisis coordinator for Ukraine told the BBC's Today programme.
""The food is stranded in Ukraine. It produces 85 million tonnes of grain every year.""
With another large harvest coming up in July and August this year, Mr Awad warned that if grain silos - currently full with food - can't be cleared, crops would rot in the fields because there would be no place to store them.
Egypt, which prior to the war received around 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is currently experiencing shortages, and warned that ""millions"" could die globally.
Meanwhile, in Turkey inflation surged to a 24-year high of 73.5% in the year to May, driven by the war in Ukraine, a weak currency and high energy prices.

Russia now appears to have the initiative over Ukraine in the battle for the Donbas, in the country's east, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said.
On the war's 100th day, the UK said Russia holds 90% of the Luhansk region - half of the Donbas - and is likely to complete control of it in two weeks.
It said these tactical successes had been achieved ""at significant resource cost"" with the concentration of forces.
But it said none of Russia's original war objectives had been achieved.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Moscow's forces are now in control of 20% of Ukrainian territory, with a front line that extends for more than 1,000 km (621 miles).
On Thursday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Western nations must be prepared to support Ukraine over the long haul, as the conflict becomes a ""war of attrition"".
In its most recent count of civilian casualties on 2 June, the UN said it had recorded 4,169 deaths and 4,982 injuries - including 67 deaths of children.
But it said the true total was likely to be considerably higher as it has not yet been able to confirm deaths in some regions where the fighting is intense - such as Mariupol in southern Ukraine, where officials estimate 21,000 civilians have been killed.
Assessing the 100-day conflict so far, the UK's Defence Intelligence, part of the Ministry of Defence, said Moscow had failed in its initial objectives of seizing Ukraine's centres of government and the capital, Kyiv.
""Staunch Ukrainian resistance"" and the failure to secure Hostomel airfield near the capital during the first 24 hours led to the Russian assault being pushed back, the intelligence update said.
It also said Russian forces suffered from ""false planning assumptions"" and ""poor tactical execution"".
But since it changed its strategy to focus on the Donbas, the region in south-eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatist groups have been fighting for eight years, Moscow has begun ""achieving tactical success"", the UK said.
""Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition,"" the intelligence update said.
""Russia controls over 90% of Luhansk Oblast and is likely to complete control in the next two weeks.""
The UK intelligence assessment said Russia had not been able to ""generate momentum or movement"" on other fronts and is on the defensive in other parts of the conflict.

Wars ebb and flow. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is no exception.
Early fears of a swift conquest were succeeded by Russian retreat and Ukrainian resistance. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
Here are five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
The war might continue for months - if not years - as Russian and Ukrainian forces grind each other down.
Momentum shifts to and fro as both sides make gains and losses. Neither side is willing to give up. Russia's President Putin judges he can gain by demonstrating strategic patience, gambling that Western countries will suffer from ""Ukraine fatigue"" and focus more on their economic crises and the threat from China.
The West, however, shows resolve and continues to supply Ukraine with weapons. Semi-permanent front lines are established. Steadily the war becomes a frozen conflict, a ""forever war"".
Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general and military scholar, says: ""There is little prospect of a crushing operational or strategic victory by either side in the short term. Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow.""
What if President Putin were to surprise the world with a unilateral ceasefire? He could pocket his territorial gains and declare ""victory"".
He could claim his ""military operation"" was complete: Russian-backed separatists in Donbas protected; a land corridor to Crimea established. He could then seek the moral high ground, putting pressure on Ukraine to stop fighting.
""This is a ploy which could be used by Russia at any time, if it wants to capitalise on European pressure on Ukraine to surrender and give up territory in exchange for notional peace,"" says Keir Giles, Russia expert at the Chatham House think tank.
The arguments are heard already in Paris, Berlin and Rome: no need to prolong the war, time to end the global economic pain, let's push for a ceasefire.
This, though, would be opposed by the US, the UK and much of eastern Europe, where policymakers believe Russia's invasion must fail, for the sake of Ukraine and the international order.
So a unilateral Russian ceasefire might change the narrative but not end the fighting.
What if both Ukraine and Russia conclude they cannot achieve more militarily and enter talks for a political settlement?
Their armies are exhausted, running short of manpower and munitions. The price in blood and treasure no longer justifies further fighting. Russia's military and economic losses are not sustainable. The Ukrainian people tire of war, unwilling to risk more lives for an eternally elusive victory.
What if the leadership in Kyiv - no longer trusting continued Western support - decide the time has come to talk? US President Joe Biden openly admits America's aim is for Ukraine to be ""in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table"".
But there may not be a battlefield stalemate for many months and any political settlement would be hard, not least because of Ukraine's lack of trust in Russia. A peace deal might not endure and could be followed by more fighting.
Could Ukraine - against the odds - achieve something close to a victory? Could Ukraine force Russian troops to withdraw to where they were before the invasion?
""Ukraine will definitely win this war,"" the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky told Dutch TV this week.
What if Russia fails to seize all Donbas and suffers more losses? Western sanctions hit Russia's war machine. Ukraine makes counter attacks, using its new long-range rockets, seizing back territory where Russian supply lines are stretched. Ukraine transforms its army from a defensive to an offensive force.
This scenario is plausible enough for policymakers to worry already about its consequences. If Mr Putin were facing defeat, might he escalate, potentially using either chemical or nuclear weapons?
The historian Niall Ferguson told a seminar at Kings College, London recently: ""It seems unlikely to me that Putin is going to accept conventional military defeat when he has a nuclear option.""
And what of a possible Russian ""victory""?
Western officials emphasise that Russia, despite early setbacks, still plans to seize the capital Kyiv and subjugate much of Ukraine. ""Those maximalist objectives remain in place,"" one official said.
Russia could capitalise on its gains in Donbas, freeing up forces for use elsewhere, perhaps even targeting Kyiv once again. The sheer weight of Russian numbers come to bear. Ukrainian forces continue to suffer.
President Zelensky already admits up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying and another 500 are wounded every day.
The people of Ukraine could divide, some wanting to fight on, others wanting to sue for peace. Some Western countries might tire of supporting Ukraine. But equally, if they thought Russia was winning, others might want to escalate.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61607184;2022-06-02;The Russian soldiers refusing to fight in Ukraine;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists. The BBC has been speaking to one such soldier.
""I don't want to go [back to Ukraine] to kill and be killed,"" says Sergey - not his real name - who spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year.
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. Sergey is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
Sergey says he is traumatised by his experience in Ukraine.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" says the young man bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
""We were like blind kittens. I'm shocked by our army. It wouldn't cost much to equip us. Why wasn't it done?""
Sergey joined the army as a conscript - most Russian men between the ages of 18-27 must complete one year of compulsory military service. But, after a few months, he made the decision to sign a two-year professional contract which would also give him a salary.
In January, Sergey was sent near the border with Ukraine for what he was told would be military drills. A month later - 24 February, the day Russia launched its invasion - he was told to cross the border. Almost immediately his unit found itself under attack.
As they stopped for the evening in an abandoned farm, their commander said: ""Well, as you will have worked out by now, this is not a joke.""
Sergey says he was completely shocked.
""My first thoughts were 'Is this really happening to me?'""
They were continually shelled, he says, both when moving and when parked overnight. In his unit of 50 people, 10 were killed and 10 others wounded. Almost all his comrades were under the age of 25.
He heard of Russian servicemen so inexperienced that they ""did not know how to shoot and couldn't tell one end of a mortar from another"".
He says his convoy - travelling through northern Ukraine - broke up after just four days when a bridge they were about to cross exploded, killing comrades ahead of them.
In another incident, Sergey says he had to overtake comrades trapped inside a burning vehicle in front of him.
""It was blown up from a grenade launcher or something else. It caught fire and there were [Russian] soldiers inside. We drove around it and on, firing as we went. I didn't look back.""
His unit moved on through the Ukrainian countryside, but there was a clear lack of strategy, he says. Reinforcements failed to arrive and soldiers were poorly equipped for the task of taking a large city.
""We went without helicopters - just in a column, as though we were heading to a parade.""
He believes his commanders had planned to capture strongholds and key cities very quickly - and had calculated that the Ukrainians would simply surrender.
""We rushed forward with short overnight stays, without trenches, without reconnaissance. We didn't leave anyone in the rear, so if someone decided to come in from behind and hit us there was no protection.
""I think that [so many of] our guys died largely because of this. If we had moved gradually, if we had checked the roads for mines many losses could have been avoided.""
Sergey's complaints about lack of equipment have also emerged in phone conversations alleged to be between Russian soldiers and their families, intercepted and posted online by the Ukrainian security services.
At the beginning of April, Sergey was sent back over the border to a camp on the Russian side. Troops had been withdrawn from northern Ukraine and appeared to be regrouping for an assault in the east. Later that month he received an order to return to Ukraine - but told his commander that he was not prepared to go.
""He said it was my choice. They didn't even [try to] dissuade us, because we weren't the first,"" Sergey told the BBC. But, he had been sufficiently worried about his unit's reaction to his refusal that he decided to seek legal advice.
A lawyer told Sergey and two like-minded colleagues to return their arms and go back to their unit's headquarters - where they should file a letter explaining that they were ""morally and psychologically exhausted"" and could not continue fighting in Ukraine.
Sergey was told that returning to the unit was important because simply leaving could be interpreted as desertion, which can result in a two-year sentence in a disciplinary battalion.
Army commanders try to intimidate contract soldiers into staying with their units, according to Russian human rights lawyer Alexei Tabalov. But he stresses that Russian military law does include clauses which allow soldiers to refuse to fight if they don't want to.
Human rights activist Sergei Krivenko says he is not aware of any prosecutions of those refusing to return to the front.
That is not to say that prosecutions are not being attempted.
One commander in northern Russia requested a criminal case be brought against his subordinate who would not return to Ukraine, but a military prosecutor refused to proceed, according to documents seen by the BBC. Such an action would be ""premature"" without having assessed the harm to the military service he was involved in, the prosecutor said.
And there is no guarantee that more prosecutions might not emerge in the future.
Soldiers like Sergey - reluctant to return to the front line - are not unusual, according to Ruslan Leviev, the editor of Conflict Intelligence Team, a media project investigating the experiences of the Russian military in Ukraine through confidential interviews and open source material.
Leviev says his team estimates a sizeable minority of the Russian contract soldiers sent to Ukraine to fight in the initial invasion refused to go back again.
Independent Russian media have also been reporting hundreds of cases of soldiers refusing repeat deployments to Ukraine since the beginning of April.
Several lawyers and human rights activists the BBC spoke to said they had been regularly offering advice to men trying to avoid returning to Ukraine. Each of our interviewees had dealt with dozens of cases and believed those soldiers were also sharing advice with their colleagues.
Although Sergey does not want to return to the front line, he does want to complete his outstanding military service in Russia to avoid any unforeseen consequences. But that means that - while his letter of refusal to fight was accepted - there are no guarantees he won't be sent back to Ukraine during his service period.
""I can see that the war continues, it is not going away,"" he told the BBC. ""In these months [of compulsory military service] that I have left, anything - including the worst - could happen.""Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists. The BBC has been speaking to one such soldier.
""I don't want to go [back to Ukraine] to kill and be killed,"" says Sergey - not his real name - who spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year.
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. Sergey is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
Sergey says he is traumatised by his experience in Ukraine.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" says the young man bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
""We were like blind kittens. I'm shocked by our army. It wouldn't cost much to equip us. Why wasn't it done?""
Sergey joined the army as a conscript - most Russian men between the ages of 18-27 must complete one year of compulsory military service. But, after a few months, he made the decision to sign a two-year professional contract which would also give him a salary.
In January, Sergey was sent near the border with Ukraine for what he was told would be military drills. A month later - 24 February, the day Russia launched its invasion - he was told to cross the border. Almost immediately his unit found itself under attack.
As they stopped for the evening in an abandoned farm, their commander said: ""Well, as you will have worked out by now, this is not a joke.""
Sergey says he was completely shocked.
""My first thoughts were 'Is this really happening to me?'""
They were continually shelled, he says, both when moving and when parked overnight. In his unit of 50 people, 10 were killed and 10 others wounded. Almost all his comrades were under the age of 25.
He heard of Russian servicemen so inexperienced that they ""did not know how to shoot and couldn't tell one end of a mortar from another"".
He says his convoy - travelling through northern Ukraine - broke up after just four days when a bridge they were about to cross exploded, killing comrades ahead of them.
In another incident, Sergey says he had to overtake comrades trapped inside a burning vehicle in front of him.
""It was blown up from a grenade launcher or something else. It caught fire and there were [Russian] soldiers inside. We drove around it and on, firing as we went. I didn't look back.""
His unit moved on through the Ukrainian countryside, but there was a clear lack of strategy, he says. Reinforcements failed to arrive and soldiers were poorly equipped for the task of taking a large city.
""We went without helicopters - just in a column, as though we were heading to a parade.""
He believes his commanders had planned to capture strongholds and key cities very quickly - and had calculated that the Ukrainians would simply surrender.
""We rushed forward with short overnight stays, without trenches, without reconnaissance. We didn't leave anyone in the rear, so if someone decided to come in from behind and hit us there was no protection.
""I think that [so many of] our guys died largely because of this. If we had moved gradually, if we had checked the roads for mines many losses could have been avoided.""
Sergey's complaints about lack of equipment have also emerged in phone conversations alleged to be between Russian soldiers and their families, intercepted and posted online by the Ukrainian security services.
At the beginning of April, Sergey was sent back over the border to a camp on the Russian side. Troops had been withdrawn from northern Ukraine and appeared to be regrouping for an assault in the east. Later that month he received an order to return to Ukraine - but told his commander that he was not prepared to go.
""He said it was my choice. They didn't even [try to] dissuade us, because we weren't the first,"" Sergey told the BBC. But, he had been sufficiently worried about his unit's reaction to his refusal that he decided to seek legal advice.
A lawyer told Sergey and two like-minded colleagues to return their arms and go back to their unit's headquarters - where they should file a letter explaining that they were ""morally and psychologically exhausted"" and could not continue fighting in Ukraine.
Sergey was told that returning to the unit was important because simply leaving could be interpreted as desertion, which can result in a two-year sentence in a disciplinary battalion.
Army commanders try to intimidate contract soldiers into staying with their units, according to Russian human rights lawyer Alexei Tabalov. But he stresses that Russian military law does include clauses which allow soldiers to refuse to fight if they don't want to.
Human rights activist Sergei Krivenko says he is not aware of any prosecutions of those refusing to return to the front.
That is not to say that prosecutions are not being attempted.
One commander in northern Russia requested a criminal case be brought against his subordinate who would not return to Ukraine, but a military prosecutor refused to proceed, according to documents seen by the BBC. Such an action would be ""premature"" without having assessed the harm to the military service he was involved in, the prosecutor said.
And there is no guarantee that more prosecutions might not emerge in the future.
Soldiers like Sergey - reluctant to return to the front line - are not unusual, according to Ruslan Leviev, the editor of Conflict Intelligence Team, a media project investigating the experiences of the Russian military in Ukraine through confidential interviews and open source material.
Leviev says his team estimates a sizeable minority of the Russian contract soldiers sent to Ukraine to fight in the initial invasion refused to go back again.
Independent Russian media have also been reporting hundreds of cases of soldiers refusing repeat deployments to Ukraine since the beginning of April.
Several lawyers and human rights activists the BBC spoke to said they had been regularly offering advice to men trying to avoid returning to Ukraine. Each of our interviewees had dealt with dozens of cases and believed those soldiers were also sharing advice with their colleagues.
Although Sergey does not want to return to the front line, he does want to complete his outstanding military service in Russia to avoid any unforeseen consequences. But that means that - while his letter of refusal to fight was accepted - there are no guarantees he won't be sent back to Ukraine during his service period.
""I can see that the war continues, it is not going away,"" he told the BBC. ""In these months [of compulsory military service] that I have left, anything - including the worst - could happen."""

Russian forces have been intensifying attacks around the eastern city of Severodonets on the 99th day of Moscow's invasion.
The last major centre held by Ukraine in the Donbas region is under attack from ""from all directions"", Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said, adding that intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations.
Some 15,000 civilians reportedly remain trapped there.
UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of Severodonetsk and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"".
But Mr Haidai insisted that Ukrainian troops had been carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".
With Russian forces making slow, grinding progress in the eastern Donbas region and military experts speaking of a long war of attrition, have cracks started to appear in the West's support for Ukraine?
In one corner, governments in the UK, Poland and the Baltic states have been consistent in calling for Russia's unambiguous defeat.
But in the other corner, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees leaders in France, Germany and Italy calling for a different approach.
Of course, it's the US president who really matters to the Kremlin.
But Joe Biden has given different signals at different times. Calling Mr Putin a ""war criminal"" back in March and seeming to hint at the need for a change in leadership in Moscow, he was also reluctant this week to send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
Russian-imposed authorities in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region have said the Ukrainian state's property and resources in the area will be ""nationalised"".
Andrei Trofimov, deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, said a decree had been signed for the nationalisation of Ukrainian property, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
Mr Trofimov said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February - the day Russia launched its invasion of the country.
""The decree was signed in order to meet state needs related to improving the overall efficiency and social orientation of the economy, as well as to preserve the national heritage for residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region,"" he said.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Russian forces have seized 20% of his country's territory, as Moscow's invasion nears its 100th day.
Addressing lawmakers in Luxembourg, he added that the front line extended for more than 1,000km (621 miles).
""All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression,"" he told MPs via videolink.
Russian forces have been intensifying attacks on the city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region.
UK defence officials say Russia has seized most of the city and are making ""steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery"".
Severodonetsk is the easternmost city under Ukrainian control and regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia was trying to break through defences in the city ""from all directions"".
However he said Ukrainian troops were carrying out counter-attacks, ""pushing back the enemy on some streets and taking several prisoners"".
Intense street-to-street fighting in the city had hampered evacuations, he said, describing such efforts as ""extremely dangerous"".
In a video address late on Thursday evening, Mr Zelensky said the situation in Donbas had not changed significantly that day but that Ukrainians had experienced ""some success"" in battles in Severodonetsk.
Some 15,000 civilians remain trapped in the city, with many of them taking shelter at the massive Azot chemical plant.
On Wednesday, Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops allegedly targeted the site during an artillery barrage.
Further south, the mayor of the occupied city of Mariupol has accused Russian forces of executing civil servants who have refused to collaborate with the new Moscow-backed city authority.
Vadym Boychenko, who was evacuated from Mariupol before it fell, said dozens of residents were being held at the Olenivka Prison and that he had received reports of locals being tortured by occupying forces. The BBC cannot verify these allegations.
Last week an adviser to Mr Boychenko told CNN that at least 22,000 people had been killed during Russia's siege and bombardment of the city.
In the north-east, Russian shelling killed a woman and injured a man in Kharkiv, regional officials said.
And in western Ukraine five civilians were hurt in missile strikes on Lviv, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said.
Western leaders are also stepping up sanctions against key allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
US Treasury Department officials unveiled a new raft of sanctions on Thursday, with targets including several yachts allegedly linked to Mr Putin and a cellist who allegedly acts as a middleman for the Russian leader.
US officials will seek to seize two vessels, the Russian-flagged Graceful and the Cayman islands-flagged Olympia, which were identified as personal assets of Mr Putin.
The cellist, Sergei Roldugin, is allegedly a custodian of the Russian president's offshore wealth.
Five oligarchs with links to Mr Putin as well as Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova will also have any US assets frozen and are barred from doing business with US-based corporations.
EU diplomats are said to have finalised a sixth package of sanctions against Moscow.
The sanctions, which include a limited ban on Russian oil imports, were reportedly agreed after officials accepted a Hungarian request to remove the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from the list of targets.
The president of the European Parliament also announced a ban on Russian lobbyists entering the chamber's campus.
Roberta Metsola wrote on Twitter that she was keen to deprive Moscow's representatives of the ability ""to spread their propaganda & false, toxic narratives about the invasion of Ukraine"".
On Wednesday President Joe Biden announced that the US would supply Ukraine with new long-range missiles capable of hitting targets at distances of up to 70km (45 miles).

Ukraine qualified for the play-off final on Wednesday by beating Scotland 3-1. Now they will play Wales, with the winners earning a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Wales are hoping to qualify for the tournament for the first time since 1958, while Ukraine qualified for their first and only World Cup in 2006.
The Ukrainian FA has been allocated 5% of matchday tickets, with those expected to go on sale in the coming days.
It's thought a small number of tickets for refugees will be made available in addition to the standard visiting allocation.
Ukrainians Svitlana Phillips and Maryna Farrell, who were living in Wales before the conflict began, had called on the FAW to give those fleeing the war with Russia the chance to see the game.
Ms Phillips, a Ukrainian who has lived in Swansea for 20 years and is married a Welshman, said it would be a ""fantastic"" thing to do.
She said: ""For the last few years, people in Wales have shown such generosity to the people of Ukraine.
""So I wouldn't be surprised if it comes to that, and there would be some tickets given away and Ukrainians can come and join and celebrate and have a cheerful day.""
Ms Farrell, originally from Lutsk, moved to Wales 14 years ago. She was visiting family in Ukraine when the Russians invaded
""I've had probably about seven phone calls this morning trying to figure out ways of getting to the match,"" she said.
""I know that Cardiff City and the FAW have been very supportive in the past, so I'm really hoping there's something that can be done.
""There is a lot of people who have already come to Wales who would absolutely love to be part of the game on Sunday. I know it will be a very emotional time for them, but it will be an unforgettable moment.
""It would be a great distraction for everyone.""
She has lived in Wales for 14 years, but will be supporting Ukraine.
""Having lived in Wales for so long I do consider myself Ukrainian-Welsh; however my roots are still in Ukraine,"" she said.
Ms Phillips said she and her husband were going to have to fight to decide whether a Ukrainian or Welsh flag would be erected.
She said: ""I am sure that Ukrainian people will be singing the Welsh anthem, and Welsh people will be singing the Ukrainian anthem, in support of recent events and in celebration of togetherness of what we have been through.
""Welsh people in the last three months have shown absolutely incredible generosity supporting Ukraine.
""So obviously it is very important for everybody around the world, what is going on in Ukraine, but at such an event like a football game I think it is going to bring people together, unite even more.""
Meanwhile, Welsh fans in Poland have raised money for Ukrainian refugees who became stuck there after Russia's invasion.
Wales lost 2-1 in Wroclaw on Wednesday in the Nations League.
Twenty young Ukrainian footballers went there for a football tournament in February, but were never able to go home.
The visiting supporters raised about 5,000 zloty (£930) to help support the refugees.
The Notice Me foundation, a charity which usually works with children with cancer, has been looking after the young footballers.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, fan Tim Hartley, who went to the match, said: ""This is just our little thank you to the people of Poland, a little something for the children of Ukraine.
""To say we really do support you, it was great to see everybody, we raffled a shirt, we had a sing-song, we raised money. It was great to see the Welsh fans supporting the charity.""
The children are slowly being joined by their mothers and their siblings, and the charity has been building a shelter for 200 children and women who are escaping the war.
It is hoped the ""Ukrainian House"" will help the children forget about the war, and will make them feel at home in Poland.
The charity has been building bathrooms and kitchens, bedrooms and lounges. There will also be classrooms and a kindergarten for the younger children.

More than 50 lightweight baby incubators, partly funded by Jersey Overseas Aid (JOA), are being sent to Ukraine after a rise in the number of premature births in the war-torn country.
Developed by British start-up company mOm, the incubators weigh only 44lbs (20kg) compared to traditional incubators which could weigh up to 220lbs (100kg), project leaders said.
They could also be used immediately by clinicians, without lengthy set-up or training times, they added.
Fifty-one incubators were going to hospitals across the country, with the first tranche being delivered on Tuesday, JOA said.
The equipment is being overseen by international development not-for-profit organisation Crown Agents.
It said the units could run off “multiple power sources, with a back-up battery, which will be vital as Ukraine continues to face power outages”.
It said it had heard reports that the stress of the war was “having a negative effect on pregnant women with doctors seeing a sharp rise in premature births”.
It added: “Incubators are vital for saving the lives of these premature babies, ensuring they remain at a safe, stable temperature.""
Douglas Melville, of JOA, said the “robust and easy-to-use incubators will undoubtedly save innocent lives”.
In March, prenatal clinics in both Kharkiv and Lviv told the BBC that the rate of preterm births had doubled or tripled, as a result of stress and medical issues linked to the war.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659;2022-05-31;What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
In its latest attempt to punish Russia for it invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is to ban all imports of oil from Russia that are brought in by sea.
It says this could cut the amount of oil that EU countries import from Russia by up to 90%, reducing the amount of money the Russian government makes from oil sales.
The EU, along with countries such as the UK and the US, have introduced a series of measures to weaken key areas of the Russian economy, such as its energy and financial sectors.
Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop it acting aggressively, or breaking international law.
They are among the toughest actions nations can take, short of going to war.
Up until now, EU states have been importing 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia and 1.2 million bpd of oil products.
Given the soaring price of oil, this has been earning Russia over $1m (£800,000) a day.
EU nations have agreed to stop importing any oil from Russia that comes in by sea, which rules out about two-thirds of the total.
They will continue, on a temporary basis, to import Russian oil by pipeline. This is to benefit countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, which are highly dependent on it.
However, Germany and Poland, which also import Russian oil by pipeline, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year.
The EU's president, Ursula von der Leyen, says this will effectively reduce the EU's oil imports from Russia to 10 or 11% of its current level.
The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.
Germany has frozen plans for the opening of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
The EU has also said it will halt Russian coal imports by August.
However, the EU is less keen to impose sanctions on Russian gas, because it relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs.
In March, the EU committed to reducing gas imports by two-thirds within a year but has not been able to agree any further action.
Western countries have introduced increasingly widespread sanctions - targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises.
Financial measures
Russia's central bank assets have been frozen to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves.
This caused the rouble to fall 22% in value, pushing up the price of imported goods and leading  Russia's inflation rate to rise to 14%. The rouble has since recovered, mainly due to measures by Moscow to prop it up, but inflation has risen above 17%.
The United States has barred Russia from making debt payments using the $600m it holds in US banks, making it harder for Russia to repay its international loans.
Major Russian banks have been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift, which will delay payments to Russia for energy exports.
The UK has excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, barred Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks,
Targeting individuals
The US, EU, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including:
The UK has also stopped the sale of ""golden visas"", which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights.
More than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russia, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Marks & Spencer.
McDonald's is leaving Russia and selling off its 850 restaurants, 30 years after setting up there.
Food giant Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik, but will still sell ""essential foods"".
However, some brands including Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they can't pull out because their businesses operate under complex franchise deals.
Military goods and mercenaries
A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose, such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK, EU and US.
The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russia's Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military.
Flights
All Russian flights have been banned from US, UK, EU and Canadian airspace.
The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians.
Luxury goods
The UK and the EU have banned the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles, high-end fashion and art.
The  UK has also imposed a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka.
Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022, including telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment and timber.
In addition, it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds, and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders.

Russia has accused the US of intentionally prolonging the war in Ukraine after President Joe Biden announced that his administration would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles in the coming weeks.
Writing in the New York Times, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Ukraine's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused the US of aiming to ""fight Russia to the last Ukrainian"" and said the move discouraged officials in Kyiv from seeking a compromise to end the conflict.
President Biden said the weapons, which Ukraine has long asked for, are to help strike enemy forces within Ukraine more precisely and from a longer distance.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine had promised not to use the new missiles to strike inside Russia, and warned of a long conflict ahead.
The intervention comes as fighting intensifies in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has been accused of ""madness"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky after striking a chemical factory in the city.
More graphic accounts of torture have emerged from Ukraine at the hands of Russian soldiers - this time from Kherson in the south of the country.
An unnamed doctor describes signs of ""body mutilation"" providing a list that includes cuts and burns, electrocution, binding and strangulation.
One man, Olexander, says a bag was put on his head and rope was tied around his neck and wrists. He says he was then beaten and threatened.
The BBC's Caroline Davies has heard multiple first-hand testimonies saying that people began to disappear when Russian troops took control of Kherson.
Earlier, three of our correspondents spent some time answering questions sent in by members of the public about the war.
Life away from the front line can seem relatively normal, says BBC Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Rainsford. But she describes the whole of Ukraine as sitting on ""a fear spectrum"" with some civilians being scared into leaving the country.
Peace talks aren't a likely option right now, says the BBC's Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. He told a reader talking is over between both sides and each blame each other - and developments on the battlefield will dictate what happens next with negotiations. Turkey offered to be a mediator, but the offer hasn't been accepted yet.

Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, nearly 15,000 allegations of war crimes have been made against Moscow's forces by Ukrainian civilians and troops.
War crimes include the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate or appalling suffering, genocide and the abuse of the rights of prisoners of war.
Kyiv's top prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, says the pace of new allegations has intensified, with 200 to 300 cases being reported every day.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61655577;2022-06-01;Ukraine war: Russia says US 'adding fuel to fire' by sending longer-range rockets;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Russia has accused the US of seeking to prolong the war in Ukraine after President Biden said he would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was ""intentionally adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries.
""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership's willingness to resume peace negotiations,"" he added.
Separately, the German government has promised to send an air defence system to Ukraine.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz told MPs that the IRIS-T system was the most modern Germany possessed and would enable Ukraine to defend an entire city against Russian air attacks.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hit out against the deliveries and said Mr Biden's announcement increased the risk of a ""third country"" being dragged into the conflict.
The long-range missiles are to help Ukrainian troops strike enemy forces more precisely from a longer distance.
The US had previously been unwilling to provide the weapons out of fear they could be used against targets in Russia, but the US says Kyiv has given assurances that this will not happen.
On Wednesday, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
A senior US official said the new weapons package would include four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).
""These are precision guided systems with extended range. And so for high value targets that that allow them to keep some of the pressure off of Ukrainian forces on the front, we think these systems will be very useful,"" Undersecretary for Defense Dr Colin H Kahl said.
The systems can launch multiple precision-guided missiles at targets as far as 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery that Ukraine currently has. They are also believed to be more accurate than their Russian equivalents.
This announcement has been a long time coming and represents one of the most significant military commitments so far.
As they face overwhelming Russian firepower in a grinding, attritional battle for the Donbas, Ukrainian forces complain that they lack firepower.
The HIMARS could change that.
Its GPS-guided rockets are much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. It's also much quicker to reload and, as the name suggests, the launch vehicles can move quickly from one location to another.
US and Ukrainian officials will already be having detailed conversations about how and where to use the HIMARS when they arrive.
Ukraine will be looking to hit targets well beyond its current reach - command and control centres, logistics hubs, and the Russian batteries that have Ukrainian troops pinned down in Donbas.
White House officials agreed to provide the rockets, they said, only after gaining assurances from President Volodomyr Zelensky that the weapons would not be used to attack targets inside Russia.
""We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,"" Mr Biden wrote on Wednesday.
Mr Zelensky confirmed this in an interview for US network Newsmax.
""We're not interested in what is happening in Russia,"" he said. ""We're only interested in our own territory in Ukraine.""
But Mr Peskov said Moscow did not trust Mr Zelensky's remarks.
""In order to have trust, we need to have experience of Kyiv fulfilling its promises, but there is none,"" he said, quoted by Ria news agency.
Addressing the US announcement, he said: ""We believe the US is directly and intentionally adding fuel to the fire... The US is obviously holding the line that it will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian.""
The latest rockets will be the centrepiece of a $700m (£556m) support package for Ukraine that will be formally unveiled later on Wednesday, White House officials said.
Helicopters, anti-tank weapons, tactical vehicles and spare parts are to be included in what will be the 11th package of military aid approved by the US for Ukraine since the invasion began in February.
Meanwhile fighting has intensified around the eastern city of Severodonetsk, where the head of the city administration says Ukrainian forces now hold just 20% of the city.
Mr Zelensky accused Russia of ""madness"" after its troops targeted the city's chemical factory Azot during an artillery barrage.
Regional head Serhiy Gaidai said civilians were sheltering from missile and artillery attacks at the plant.
""There are civilians there in bomb shelters, there are quite a few of them, but it will not be a second Azovstal as that plant had a huge underground city … which isn't there at Azot,"" Mr Gaidai said.
Capturing Severodonetsk, the final major city still held by Ukraine in the Luhansk region, is a key aim of Russia's invasion and Western officials say Moscow is making ""incremental but pretty steady gains"".Russia has accused the US of seeking to prolong the war in Ukraine after President Biden said he would supply Kyiv with new long-range missiles.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was ""intentionally adding fuel to the fire"" with the deliveries.
""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership's willingness to resume peace negotiations,"" he added.
Separately, the German government has promised to send an air defence system to Ukraine.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz told MPs that the IRIS-T system was the most modern Germany possessed and would enable Ukraine to defend an entire city against Russian air attacks.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hit out against the deliveries and said Mr Biden's announcement increased the risk of a ""third country"" being dragged into the conflict.
The long-range missiles are to help Ukrainian troops strike enemy forces more precisely from a longer distance.
The US had previously been unwilling to provide the weapons out of fear they could be used against targets in Russia, but the US says Kyiv has given assurances that this will not happen.
On Wednesday, Mr Biden said the lethal aid would strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position against Russia and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
A senior US official said the new weapons package would include four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).
""These are precision guided systems with extended range. And so for high value targets that that allow them to keep some of the pressure off of Ukrainian forces on the front, we think these systems will be very useful,"" Undersecretary for Defense Dr Colin H Kahl said.
The systems can launch multiple precision-guided missiles at targets as far as 70km (45 miles) away - far further than the artillery that Ukraine currently has. They are also believed to be more accurate than their Russian equivalents.
This announcement has been a long time coming and represents one of the most significant military commitments so far.
As they face overwhelming Russian firepower in a grinding, attritional battle for the Donbas, Ukrainian forces complain that they lack firepower.
The HIMARS could change that.
Its GPS-guided rockets are much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. It's also much quicker to reload and, as the name suggests, the launch vehicles can move quickly from one location to another.
US and Ukrainian officials will already be having detailed conversations about how and where to use the HIMARS when they arrive.
Ukraine will be looking to hit targets well beyond its current reach - command and control centres, logistics hubs, and the Russian batteries that have Ukrainian troops pinned down in Donbas.
White House officials agreed to provide the rockets, they said, only after gaining assurances from President Volodomyr Zelensky that the weapons would not be used to attack targets inside Russia.
""We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,"" Mr Biden wrote on Wednesday.
Mr Zelensky confirmed this in an interview for US network Newsmax.
""We're not interested in what is happening in Russia,"" he said. ""We're only interested in our own territory in Ukraine.""
But Mr Peskov said Moscow did not trust Mr Zelensky's remarks.
""In order to have trust, we need to have experience of Kyiv fulfilling its promises, but there is none,"" he said, quoted by Ria news agency.
Addressing the US announcement, he said: ""We believe the US is directly and intentionally adding fuel to the fire... The US is obviously holding the line that it will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian.""

For years there have been calls for Asia - which is home to some of the world's biggest CO2 emitters - to ditch fossil fuels to help tackle climate change.
Countries in the region - including its three biggest economies China, Japan and India - were criticised last year for not making a bigger commitment at the COP26 global climate change conference.
But six months on, there is another, arguably more immediate reason for Asia to make the transition away from oil, gas and coal: money.
Global energy prices have jumped since late February when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
It has pushed European countries to find ways to rely less on Russian gas with Germany hoping hydrogen could be its answer.
Japan and South Korea had also invested heavily in hydrogen technology before the Ukraine war and the soaring cost of energy has provided an additional incentive to accelerate their transition to greener fuels.
However, Asian economies have continued to burn coal to produce electricity despite how much it pollutes the environment.
While some countries have made progress in moving away from fossil fuels, in emergencies - like when two of the region's economic giants China and India were hit by power shortages - it was coal that they turned to.
Japan had invested in nuclear power for decades but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, it too went back to fossil fuels.
Some experts believe hydrogen can help countries make the transition from fossil fuels to renewables and that is what a growing number of South Korean businesses are now betting on.
The country has so far announced the largest government spending in Asia on the development of hydrogen technology.
Seoul is pushing investments into the production of hydrogen as well as technology for fuel cell power generation and hydrogen-powered cars.
Hydrogen is also considered by some experts to be the most practical alternative to fossil fuels as it can be stored as a solid, liquid or gas.
That means, in comparison to solar and wind, it can be more easily stockpiled and transported.
""Hydrogen is like an energy carrier,"" says Vince Heo of S&P Global Commodity Insights in Seoul.
""You can store energy in the hydrogen and you can use them whenever you want.""
A key issue is that there are different types of hydrogen and what South Korea is currently investing in is not emission-free.
The goal is to eventually transition to so-called ""green hydrogen"", which is also known as ""clean hydrogen"".
It is produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, but it is the most expensive type of hydrogen to produce.
That is why hydrogen produced using fossil fuels has been seen by some experts as the first step towards green hydrogen.
""South Korea's hydrogen is currently produced from natural gas,"" Martin Tengler who is BloombergNEF's lead hydrogen analyst says, explaining that it is referred to as ""grey hydrogen"".
The next stage in the transition is ""blue hydrogen"", which is also made using fossil fuels but 60% to 90% of the carbon dioxide produced in the process is captured and stored.
South Korea's biggest natural gas supplier, SK, has invested 18 trillion won, or around ($15bn; £12bn), but only in grey and blue hydrogen.
The boss of its hydrogen business unit, Hyeong-wook Choo, told the BBC the company did not invest in green hydrogen straight away because more technology and investment was needed to do so.
With renewable sources of energy and infrastructure to capture and distribute it not readily available in much of Asia, a major challenge has been to develop the right mix of technologies to harness enough energy to mass produce hydrogen.
""We can develop the market by manufacturing, distributing and consuming hydrogen. So when green hydrogen becomes available, there will be more ability to expand this hydrogen business,"" Mr Choo added.
The crucial issue behind this is how much it costs to produce each of the different types of gas.
""Green hydrogen costs more than two to three times of grey hydrogen,"" says Mr Heo of S&P Global.
""Currently, it's about $10 per kilogramme to produce green hydrogen.""
Mr Heo says to be cost effective, the amount has to decline by 70% to around $3 per kilogramme without government subsidies.
But the jump in global energy prices means that ""there's clearly some momentum on green hydrogen because it is produced from renewable energy which is detached from the high fuel prices environment,"" he added.
For example in Europe, the costs of producing blue and grey hydrogen at times increased by more than 70% following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy.
If affordable green hydrogen becomes available, there are a number of industries that can benefit.
""We can replace grey hydrogen in industries where there are no emissions-low alternatives like refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and heavy industries like steel production which require high temperatures,"" Mr Tengler said.
To be able to compete globally, South Korea has created a hydrogen alliance which more than a dozen companies have joined.
""The hydrogen industry at the moment is like the solar industry about 20 years ago where there are few projects being developed and there is a big ambition in the market,"" said Mr Heo.
Wind power is one of the keys to South Korea's green hydrogen ambitions.
A consortium led by Korea Maritime and Ocean University is developing a floating offshore plant to produce green hydrogen in the city of Busan.
""What we're envisioning is to use electricity from wind and solar out at sea, to boil and electrolyse seawater to produce green hydrogen,"" Doh Deog-hee, President of Korea Maritime and Ocean University said.
Its advantage is its proximity to hydrogen consumers, Mr Heo said: ""You can save the hydrogen transportation costs because that's a big, very expensive part of the hydrogen value chain.""
""But floating offshore wind costs more than $300 per megawatt hour compared to $100 per megawatt hour of using solar power so how to actually optimise the cost of producing hydrogen from this facility is a big question,"" he added.
The transition to cleaner sources of energy has always been costly.
When global leaders met for COP26 in November, the world was starting to face higher fuel prices due to the pent-up demand after the pandemic lockdowns.
For many countries it was, and still is, very tempting to go back to fossil fuels.
The question is whether the soaring fuel prices could be a bigger motivator for a change.For years there have been calls for Asia - which is home to some of the world's biggest CO2 emitters - to ditch fossil fuels to help tackle climate change.

Heavy fighting continues in east Ukraine, with key locations under intense bombardment from Russian forces.
Here are the latest developments:
Russian officials have said their forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion.
Russia has made slow but significant advances in the east, with the governor of Luhansk saying last week that Russians forces controlled more than 90% of the region.
But a decision by the US to send new longer-range weaponry to Ukraine means it should be easier for the Ukrainians to defend their positions against Russian artillery strikes in the future.
President Joe Biden said the rocket systems were intended to strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position and make a diplomatic solution more likely.
Russian forces are reported to be in control of most of Severodonetsk and Ukrainian forces are said to be withdrawing further to the west.
Taking the city has been one of Russia's key aims as it would mean they control almost all of the Luhansk region.
But the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the Ukrainian call to withdraw from Severodonetsk was ""strategically sound"" as the city's loss was ""largely symbolic"".
Russian troops have moved north from Popasna, with the key supply route from Bakhmut to Lysychansk being bombarded by Russian artillery.
Should the route be taken by Russia, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk would be left with one supply road via Siversk.
Reports suggest that Lyman is now under Russian control, and forces are regrouping to try to take the city of Slovyansk,
Russian forces have suffered heavy losses since the invasion began.
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia is likely to have suffered devastating losses among its middle and junior ranking officers, because they have been deployed at the front lines of fighting. It says these losses are likely to contribute to a loss of morale and poor discipline among lower ranks.
Significant quantities of Russian weaponry have also been destroyed.
As a result, Russia has tried to combine some heavily depleted units, forming what some analysts have called 'Frankenstein forces' to fight in the east.
Ukraine has successfully pushed Russian forces away from Kharkiv, though Russian units are continuing to shell some parts of the city, according to the ISW.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops in the Kharkiv region last week, his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began.
In southern Donetsk, Russia is now fully in control of the port city of Mariupol, after a siege lasting more than two months came to an end on 20 May.
Analysts say the fall of the city may enable Russian units to join the fight in other areas such as Zaporizhzhia, where the shelling of Ukrainian forces is ongoing.
Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.
But strong resistance from Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv in the west and in Mariupol significantly slowed Russian advances.
To the west, Russia had aimed to take control of Odesa and cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but its forces were blocked by a staunch defence in Mykolaiv and forced back towards Kherson by a Ukrainian counteroffensive in March.
The ISW says control of the region around Kherson could be critical to Ukraine's future, if the Ukrainians can regain control of land to the west of the Dnipro river they will be in a stronger position to resist any future Russian invasion.
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv in early April after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital.
Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have seen missile attacks but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61652467;2022-05-31;Ukraine reports 15,000 suspected war crimes;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor said.
Some 600 suspects have been identified and 80 prosecutions have begun, Iryna Venediktova told reporters in The Hague.
The list of suspects includes ""top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russia"", she added.
Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes.
Of the 15,000 alleged war crimes, Ms Veneditkova said several thousand had been identified in the eastern Donbas region - the scene of fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops.
Alleged war crimes in the region include the possible forcible transfer of people - including cases of adults and children - to different parts of Russia, Ms Venediktova said. Torture, the killing of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are also suspected war crimes, she added.
Though investigations relating to the eastern region have started, Ukrainian authorities do not have access to Russian-held areas, AFP news agency reports Ms Venediktova as saying. They were, however, interviewing evacuees and prisoners-of-war, she added.
""Investigations are very difficult when fighting is going on at the same time,"" she is quoted as saying by German news agency DPA.
Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia have also joined the investigation efforts, Ms Venediktova said. Poland and Lithuania were already helping.
The International Criminal Court described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"" and has despatched its largest team of investigators ever to Ukraine to assist in the investigations. It said it was also hoping to open an office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv.
The announcements came as two Russian soldiers were jailed for 11 and a half years in Ukraine on Tuesday for shelling civilian areas. The first Russian soldier to be put on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a civilian last week.
Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova, was also sacked by Ukraine's parliament. She was criticised for not organising humanitarian corridors and facilitating prisoner exchanges, as well as her handling of alleged rape cases against Russian soldiers, according to local media reports. Ms Denisova said she would appeal the decision.
On the ground, Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region.
The city is said to be divided between the two sides - but not equally. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai said ""70%-80% of the city is controlled by the Russian army"".
An explosion also reportedly hit a nitric acid container in the city, which is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Mr Haidai said. He told the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air following the explosion, but only in a small area.
Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.
Away from the fighting, European Union leaders reached political agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia, excluding pipeline oil, which Hungary had opposed. But EU members remain split over Russian gas exports.
Russian oil giant Gazprom also announced it would be cutting gas supplies to Denmark's Orsted, as well as Shell Europe for its supplies to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles - something Russia has demanded.Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor said.

Michael Kerr has split loyalties for the World Cup semi-final play off match as he has a Ukrainian mother and a Scottish father.
Mr Kerr said, with the exception of Eurovision, the game will be the first time Ukraine has been in the global spotlight for something positive since it was invaded by Russia more than three months ago.

The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides.
Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said.
Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests.
""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC.
Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk. At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killed since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian.
There can be few stories more harrowing than that of Hlib Stryzhko, an injured Ukrainian prisoner-of-war who somehow survived his ordeal, released in a prisoner exchange.
While defending the port of Mariupol, he was fired at by a tank and fell three floors.
As the BBC's James Waterhouse reports, after his capture he endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw.
He said he could not believe he was back in Ukraine, ""a place where you can breathe freely"".
A Ukrainian refugee in the UK says she got a surprise when her husband showed her a photo of a Russian tank - with some of her household items sitting on top.
Alina Koreniuk says the box in the photo contains a new boiler she planned to install before the war started - along with some new sheets.
She and her children left Ukraine on 8 April and are staying with a British couple in Nottinghamshire.
The picture, taken in late May, shows the tank moving past bombed residential buildings in the town of Popasna.
Many residents of occupied areas of Ukraine have complained of looting by Russian troops and, as the BBC's Robert Greenall reports, the prospect of looting was not unexpected for Ms Koreniuk.
The European Union agreed a deal to block all Russian oil imports arriving by sea, and cut overall imports by 90% by the end of the year.
Weeks of wrangling failed to get that number to 100%, with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban holding out against a complete ban - because Hungary still relies on Russian pipelines for its oil.
Oil prices hit fresh highs in response, with Brent crude rising above $123 a barrel, the highest it had been for two months.
And, as the BBC's Reality Check points out, the EU will still use Russian gas (rather than oil) because other countries like Germany depend on it. Read their piece on the world's reliance on Russian oil and gas here.

Kvitka Perehinets, a Ukrainian student at the University of Edinburgh, has been anxiously following the war in her home country from a distance.
Most of her family are there - some of them fighting - and she told the BBC she was distressed by recent tweets by a politics professor, which appeared to cast doubt on the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol by the Russians.

Russian forces have been in control of the town, in the Luhansk region, since 8 May.

It was originally spotted by her husband.
""He said: 'Do you notice anything strange about this photo,' and asked me if I saw what he saw in it,"" she told the BBC.
Apart from the boiler, other items on the tank include a tablecloth from the family's summer house, new Disney bedsheets for her children and a red blanket, she says.
The bed linen was used to cover something, Ms Koreniuk added, probably a TV or other electronic equipment, all of which had been left at the house when they were forced to leave.

A family who fled Ukraine have been reunited with their beloved dog after he spent two months in UK quarantine.
Mike and Alla Haley travelled 2,000 miles (3,218 km) from Kyiv to north-east England with one-year-old Archie.
A technical issue over the Pomeranian's rabies vaccine led to him being quarantined on 1 April and kept from the family as they settled.
Mr Haley, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, who has lived in Ukraine for 17 years, said the couple were ""really happy"".
""He is a bit nervous, he has been in real isolation for two months,"" he said.
The 61-year-old, who taught English and was a translator before the war, said Archie was entertaining child refugees as they fled Ukraine.
""He kept us sane and amused, it felt like he saved us in a way,"" he added.
""Because of the quarantine, it felt like we couldn't save him and we let him down.""
After travelling via Poland to Amsterdam they sailed to North Shields with Archie but the dog was held by the Animal and Plant Health Agency when they arrived, they said.
Mrs Haley, who suffers from panic attacks, was upset at losing her dog and her husband made repeated unsuccessful attempts to find out when they could get him back from a quarantine centre in Aberdeen.
After they spoke to the media, the agency, which is overseen by Defra, said Archie could go home soon.
Mrs Haley, 51, said she has concerns about the dog's ongoing health, as he was forced to have a second rabies vaccine in the UK just six weeks after his first.
Archie must isolate before he is allowed out of the Newcastle flat the family has been loaned with the help of a charity.
Mrs Haley said she was grateful to people in the UK who have made them and her 81-year-old mother Valentyna feel welcome.
The family hopes to return to Kyiv in the summer.
Defra previously said: ""We have increased resources and streamlined processes to ensure those fleeing Ukraine and entering the UK are not delayed by bringing their pets.
""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times and lower-risk animals are being moved into isolation.""

While his homemade borsch bubbles on the hob, Olexander Guz shows me pictures of his bruised body on his phone.
The injuries, he says, were inflicted by the Russian authorities. ""They put a bag on my head,"" Olexander tells me. ""The Russians threatened that I would not have kidneys left.""
The BBC has gathered several graphic testimonies of residents in Kherson who say they were tortured.
Warning: this report contains some graphic content that readers may find distressing.
Olexander used to live in Bilozerka, a small village in the Kherson region. He was one of the village's deputies. As a young man he was a conscript in the army, but now runs his own business.
He and his wife were publicly anti-Russia: she attended pro-Ukrainian rallies, he tried to stop Russian troops entering their village.
It wasn't long after Russia took over that soldiers came looking for him.
""They tied a rope around my neck and another around my wrists,"" he recalls. He says they told him to stand with his legs wide apart while they questioned him.
""When I didn't answer them, they hit me between my legs. When I fell, I started to suffocate. As you try to get up, they beat you. Then they ask again.""
Russian troops took control of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, early in the war. Ukrainian TV stations were quickly replaced with Russian state broadcasts. Western products were changed for Russian alternatives.
According to multiple first-hand testimonies, people also began to disappear.
Piecing together what is happening inside Kherson is difficult. As Russia has tightened its grip on the region, people have become increasingly frightened to speak out.
Those who manage to leave often delete all the photos and videos from their phones for fear of being stopped and detained at Russian checkpoints. Olexander sent images of his injuries to his son, who was abroad, for safe keeping before wiping his phone.
It means to corroborate testimonies, it is necessary to speak to multiple people who say they have been victims of torture.
Oleh Baturin is one of them. He was a journalist for an independent newspaper in the Kherson region. Within days of Russia's invasion, he says he was kidnapped.
""They shouted, 'On your knees',"" he says. ""They covered my face... and put my hands behind my back. They beat me on the back, ribs and legs... and hit me with the butt of a machine gun.""
It was only later, when he went to see a doctor, that Oleh realised they had broken four of his ribs. He says he was imprisoned for eight days. In that time, he heard others being tortured and witnessed a young man's mock execution.
Both Olexander and Oleh are now in Ukrainian-held territory. They provided the BBC with photos of what they said were police reports of the abuse.
Some allegations of torture are particularly graphic. I spoke to one doctor who worked in a hospital in Kherson. He asked to remain anonymous, but provided me with a picture of his hospital ID.
""There were signs of bodily mutilation,"" he says, listing haematomas (localised bleeding outside blood vessels that appears as a bad bruise), abrasions, cut marks, signs of electrocution, traces of binding on the hands and strangulation marks on the neck.
He says he also saw burns on people's feet and hands, and that one patient told him he was beaten with a hose filled with sand.
""Some of the worst were burn marks on genitals, a gunshot wound to the head of a girl who was raped and burns from an iron on a patient's back and stomach. The patient told me two wires from a car battery were attached to his groin and he was told to stand on a wet rag"", the doctor adds.
He believes there were many others severely injured who did not receive treatment.
Some stay at home because they are too intimidated to go outside. And some, he says, are ""psychologically pressured"" by the Russians. ""They threaten that their families will be killed, and they intimidate them in every possible way.""
He says he asked the patients why they had been picked by the Russian authorities.
""They were tortured if they did not want to go over to the Russian side, for being at rallies, for being in the territorial defence, for the fact that one of the family members fought against the separatists, some got there randomly.""
Some people are afraid their loved ones could be next.
Victoria (not her real name) fears for her parents, who are still in Kherson. Her father used to be in the Ukrainian territorial defence and has already been kidnapped and beaten once, she tells me.
""They dropped him in the middle of a field. When he got home, after a few minutes he burst into tears, even though he is not a sentimental person. I'm trying to help, but it all made me feel like a little girl.""
Now Victoria worries it could happen again.
The BBC is not the only one investigating what is going on in Kherson. Both the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and Human Rights Watch have told us they are also concerned about the allegations of torture and enforced disappearances.
Belkis Wille, from Human Rights Watch, says the testimony gathered by the BBC is consistent with what they are hearing.
She says the concern is that Russian forces, in areas they are occupying, are continuing to a certain extent to ""terrorise the local civilian population and use abusive practices like arbitrary detention and forced disappearance and torture"".
""These are potential war crimes we're looking at,"" she adds.
The Russian Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Previously, the Kremlin spokesperson said allegations of war crimes in Bucha were ""obvious fakes and the most egregious ones are staged, as has been convincingly proved by our experts.""
Exactly what is happening in Kherson is near impossible to establish from the outside, but as more testimonies are gathered, many paint a picture of fear, intimidation, violence and repression.
Victoria is trying to get her parents out.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902;2022-05-29;Russia won't use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says ambassador to UK;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Russia's ambassador to Britain has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
Andrei Kelin said that according to Russian military rules, such weapons are not used in conflicts like this.
He also described allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha as ""a fabrication"".
And he called UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss ""very belligerent"" and inexperienced.
On the use of nuclear weapons, Mr Kelin said Russia has very strict rules for their use, mainly when the state's existence is threatened.
""It has nothing to do with the current operation,"" he told BBC One's Sunday Morning.
When Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion, it was widely perceived as a warning.
Mr Putin blamed the development on aggression by the West and Nato. But the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded it an attempt to distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"", saying Russia was behind schedule on its invasion after just a few days, and trying to ""remind the world"" it had a deterrent.
Tactical nuclear weapons are those which can be used at relatively short distances, as opposed to ""strategic"" nuclear weapons which can be launched over much longer distances and raise the spectre of all-out nuclear war.
But the term still includes many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used on a battlefield. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons.
The BBC's Clive Myrie asked the ambassador about comments made by UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who said the war will only end once Russian President Vladimir Putin removes his troops entirely.
Mr Kelin said Ms Truss was ""very belligerent"".
He said she was ""neither a professional military man"" nor experienced as foreign secretary. ""If she would like to continue the war she will prolongate the conflict,"" he added.
In a sometimes terse exchange, the ambassador denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"".
Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.
""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway...""
Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?""
""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied.
Russia has made such allegations before, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier claiming that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew.
This was contradicted by numerous eyewitness accounts from residents, who told the BBC that Russian troops had summarily executed their loved ones.
""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" one man said of his murdered son-in-law.
Satellite imagery also appears to directly contradict Moscow's position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town.
The ambassador was also asked about CCTV footage of Russian soldiers killing unarmed civilians in Ukraine.
Mr Kelin said the footage was ""probably a piece of a film or a piece of a game or a joke or whatever, it's a computer games set"".
What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin is what we've been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
The horrors of Bucha are dismissed as a fabrication, and the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
In other words, none of this is ever Russia's fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
This is the Kremlin narrative which we've heard many times before.
We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we're hearing it again now.
Watch Clive Myrie's full interview with Russia's ambassador to Britain.Russia's ambassador to Britain has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
Andrei Kelin said that according to Russian military rules, such weapons are not used in conflicts like this.
He also described allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha as ""a fabrication"".
And he called UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss ""very belligerent"" and inexperienced.
On the use of nuclear weapons, Mr Kelin said Russia has very strict rules for their use, mainly when the state's existence is threatened.
""It has nothing to do with the current operation,"" he told BBC One's Sunday Morning.
When Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion, it was widely perceived as a warning.
Mr Putin blamed the development on aggression by the West and Nato. But the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded it an attempt to distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"", saying Russia was behind schedule on its invasion after just a few days, and trying to ""remind the world"" it had a deterrent.
Tactical nuclear weapons are those which can be used at relatively short distances, as opposed to ""strategic"" nuclear weapons which can be launched over much longer distances and raise the spectre of all-out nuclear war.
But the term still includes many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used on a battlefield. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons.
The BBC's Clive Myrie asked the ambassador about comments made by UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who said the war will only end once Russian President Vladimir Putin removes his troops entirely.
Mr Kelin said Ms Truss was ""very belligerent"".
He said she was ""neither a professional military man"" nor experienced as foreign secretary. ""If she would like to continue the war she will prolongate the conflict,"" he added.
In a sometimes terse exchange, the ambassador denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"".
Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.
""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway...""
Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?""
""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied.
Russia has made such allegations before, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier claiming that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew.
This was contradicted by numerous eyewitness accounts from residents, who told the BBC that Russian troops had summarily executed their loved ones.
""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" one man said of his murdered son-in-law.
Satellite imagery also appears to directly contradict Moscow's position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town.
The ambassador was also asked about CCTV footage of Russian soldiers killing unarmed civilians in Ukraine.
Mr Kelin said the footage was ""probably a piece of a film or a piece of a game or a joke or whatever, it's a computer games set"".

The port city of Berdyansk had been occupied by Russian troops for less than a week, but a new pro-Kremlin online media outlet had already moved in.
The company, whose name translates as Southern Front, makes and distributes pro-Vladimir Putin propaganda across YouTube, social media app Telegram, and through a website that targets areas newly under Russian control.
The Southern Front news site posted its first message on day one of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now has several correspondents filing stories on a daily basis.
The BBC has found evidence that the site's reporting contains falsehoods and misleading claims.
In early March, Southern Front's correspondent was at the scene in Berdyansk. They reported that Russian soldiers had apparently thwarted an attack, and killed two Moroccan men involved. The reporter alleged the men were working as mercenaries for Ukraine.  But it appears elements of the video were staged.
The two Moroccan men identified in the attack were allegedly found with their Ukrainian residency permits still on them.
The BBC tracked down one of the men implicated. According to the report he was dead, but we spoke to him on social media. He requested anonymity but says he was not aware of the Russian report and that he left Ukraine before the invasion and returned to Morocco.
Southern Front regularly posts videos containing unsubstantiated claims.
The majority of the reports claim to show ""peaceful life"" has been established in occupied areas. The channel often runs stories that justify Russia's invasion.
In one video package, a correspondent reports from a library where she says she found numerous examples of books containing ""Nazi symbols"". No evidence is seen on screen. The books that do appear on camera include works by contemporary Ukrainian writers about genuine historical events, such as the battle of Ilovaisk.
""Southern Front is likely to be part of the wider Russian strategy to establish control over the occupied territories of Ukraine,"" says Julia Smirnova, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
The company and its social media channels are portraying the Russian occupation in the southern regions of Ukraine as a ""liberation"", and Russian forces as ""protectors"", says Ms Smirnova.
Southern Front's first message on Telegram to its small audience of 25 subscribers on the day of the invasion said: ""Vladimir Putin announced the start of a special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify the territory of Ukraine!""
Three months into the occupation, its audience has now grown to 23,000.
A website was registered a day after the invasion started. Initially using a Russian server from St Petersburg, it then moved to the American provider Cloudflare, which allows a site to hide the identity of its owner.
The channel produces a regular news service fronted by young, apparently amateur presenters from annexed Crimea or self-declared separatist republics. Ukrainian news sources have been largely cut off.
One of the presenters contacted by BBC Russian said they worked for free, and didn't know who funded the operations.
We also asked Southern Front about the ownership, but did not receive a reply.
But it does appear an influential organisation with ties to the Russian government is hosting Southern Front's content.
After researching dozens of videos, we noticed some clues as to who might be behind the shadowy media organisation.
Many of them were recorded in a conference room displaying the logo of the Russia-Donbas Integration Committee, which suggests this organisation's premises are used to film.  The Crimea-based committee's mission, listed on its website, is to build economic and humanitarian ties with the annexed Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist republics in the Donbas.
The leaders of these self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine have key roles in the organisation. The co-ordinator is Andrei Kozenko — a former Russian MP, currently under US and EU sanctions.
Southern Front's content reaches far beyond its website.
A network of like-minded Telegram accounts covering occupied cities often publishes its material.
Collectively, these channels now have more than 80,000 subscribers, although our research shows at least one-third of these were probably paid for to artificially inflate the audience. In three channels the number of followers jumped by more than 10,000 in an hour overnight on 29 March, according to analysis of TG Stat, which tracks Telegram data.
Despite the relatively small following on social media, Southern Front has been boosted by influential accounts, including a pro-Russian blogger with more than 650,000 followers, and by pro-Kremlin media such as Moskovsky Komsomolets - a Moscow-based newspaper found in most post-Soviet countries.
But the fightback has started. Recently pro-Ukrainian activists hacked Southern Front's website with a message about Kherson, which the region's new rulers say they want to be annexed by Russia.
One of the posts warned that any individuals involved in a so-called referendum on the future of the region will be punished by Ukraine.
It said: ""Welcome to Hell!!!""
Despite the attack, the site was up and running again shortly afterwards.
There are worrying signs for residents if the project establishes itself. After nearby Crimea was annexed in 2014, independent media outlets were expelled, says Ms Smirnova.
""In southern Ukraine, Russian authorities are likely to follow a similar path by threatening and arresting independent journalists, silencing independent media outlets and replacing them with propaganda channels.""

The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine.
Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation.
President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have urged delivery of the MLRS to counter Russia's heavy bombardments in the eastern Donbas region.
But President Joe Biden said the US would not send Ukraine rocket systems ""that can strike into Russia"".
There are concerns that such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Moscow.
Moscow has welcomed President Biden's decision not to send weapons to Ukraine that could reach deep inside Russia.
Russia continues to pound Severodonetsk and other parts of Donbas with rockets, tanks and air strikes.
Kyiv's forces are already using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But the MLRS would allow Ukraine to reach targets much further away than that.
An M270 MLRS battery can fire a range of munitions, with the most advanced able to hit targets up to 300km (186 miles) away. However, it can also fire shorter-range rockets with a range of around 70km (43 miles).
Limiting Ukraine to the smaller rockets could be a way for the US to avoid escalating the conflict, while still significantly improving Ukraine's arsenal.
A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range weapons compatible with the system.
The UK also has the MLRS. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine should get the rockets ""to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery"", but he did not say the UK would supply them.
The US used the MLRS to destroy major Iraqi targets in the 1990-91 Gulf War and in 2003.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of ""pumping up the Ukrainian nationalists with weapons"".
He said the West was ""waging a proxy war"" against Russia which, he warned, would mean ""inevitable escalation"".
Last week, a presenter on Russian state TV said the US would be crossing a ""red line"" by supplying the MLRS to Ukraine, and it would be seen as an attempt to ""provoke a very harsh response from Russia"".
In an extra move to defend Ukraine's key Black Sea port - Odesa - Denmark has supplied Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, with a range of about 130km (70 nautical miles).
Ukraine can deploy them alongside its own Neptune missiles, credited with having sunk Russia's flagship cruiser Moskva last month.
Russian long-range missiles have struck railway facilities, oil depots and other infrastructure in western Ukraine - seen partly as an effort to thwart Western arms deliveries.
Meanwhile, Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area - a weapon described as a giant flamethrower. Its use was reported by Tass news agency, quoting a Russian security official.
The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates a massive explosion by igniting a gas cloud on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.

European Union countries are struggling to impose a future ban on Russian oil imports, with Hungary the principal opponent.
Hungary is a major importer of Russian oil. With Hungary facing a cost-of-living crisis, it said the sanction would amount to an ""atomic bomb"" dropped on Hungary's economy. Its President, Victor Orban, is also a long-term ally of Putin.

Extra train services have been laid on for football fans travelling home from Scotland's semi-final play-off match against Ukraine on Wednesday.
ScotRail made the announcement hours after warning supporters travelling further than Glasgow city centre they were unlikely to get home by train.
Critics described the move as a ""U-turn... after a day of chaos"".
ScotRail said 13 post-match services had been added.
It tweeted: ""We said we'd do our best to put on extra late-night services for supporters going to the Scotland vs Ukraine World Cup play-off at Hampden on Wednesday and we've been working hard to do that. We've managed to schedule these extra services.""
They include more trains to Edinburgh, Stirling, Ayr, Gourock, East Kilbride and Neilston.
However there will still be no way for fans travelling to Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness or Dumfries to return home by train.
An emergency timetable is in place on ScotRail trains due to a driver dispute over pay.
Earlier ScotRail said its final services to most of Scotland's cities were due to leave before kick off at 19:45.
Some additional trains and extra seats were already laid on within the city, allowing fans to travel between Glasgow Central and stations near Hampden Park.
But the latest service outside Glasgow would have been to Edinburgh, due to depart Glasgow Queen Street station at 22:15.
Even if the match finished after 90 minutes - at 21:30 - fans would have been unable to leave Hampden and get to Queen Street in time for the last train.
Although additional services have no been added, supporters from locations further afield will still have to look for alternative transport.
The final service to both Aberdeen and Dundee will leave Glasgow at 19:45 - according to the ScotRail app - while the latest anyone can return to Dumfries would be 19:07.
Those hoping to head back to Inverness will be unable to do so after 19:07 and those hoping to return to Perth will need to make the 19:37 service.
The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the additional services, but said if this was how nationalised ScotRail would manage major events, passengers faced ""a summer of misery"".
Transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""This is a welcome, last-minute U-turn by ScotRail after a day of chaos in which they initially refused to lay on later trains for fans heading back to Edinburgh.
""We flagged up this problem with the Scotland game 10 days ago, so this could and should have been resolved far earlier.""
A Transport Scotland spokesman said: ""While this is an operational matter for ScotRail, we have their assurances they are looking at all opportunities to add further additional services.
""While we appreciate the complexities and difficulties of delivering extra services when there are a number of unknown factors and an industrial dispute is ongoing, Ministers were clear last week about their hopes for Wednesday's match.
""As they have already stated, ScotRail will provide further information as soon as possible.""
The newly nationalised rail operator has been hit by a pay dispute with train drivers union Aslef, which has meant staff have refused to work on their rest days.
The temporary timetable brought in a week ago saw almost 700 fewer services a day, with many later trains cancelled.
Train drivers rejected a 2.2% pay offer but were offered a 4.2% pay rise and improved conditions on Thursday.
ScotRail confirmed there would be additional services for the Scotland v Ukraine match on 1 June to and from Mount Florida, and extra carriages on trains to Mount Florida and Kings Park - the closest stations to the ground. 
Visiting Ukraine fans who decide to travel by rail should use services to and from Mount Florida.
However, supporters were advised to allow extra travel time as services would still be busy. Buying return tickets to Mount Florida in advance would help to avoid queuing on the day.
The company said extra staff would be available to help customers on Wednesday and also for Scotland's Nations League home match against Armenia on 8 June.
Phil Campbell, ScotRail's head of customer operations, said: ""We know this is a massive match for the Scottish national team and we are looking forward to helping supporters travel to Hampden to play their part in the occasion. It's also an honour to welcome Ukraine fans to Glasgow.
""We'll be doing everything we can to support fans travelling to the games by adding additional services where we can and more seats to trains where possible. The temporary timetable will still be in place, so it is important that fans plan ahead to make sure they are aware of their options for both getting into the city, and for completing their journey home.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61628473;2022-05-30;Ukraine war: Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov denies Putin illness;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill.
In an interview with French TV, Mr Lavrov said the Russian leader appears in public every day, and no sane person would see any signs of an ailment.
There has been increasing unconfirmed media speculation that Mr Putin, who turns 70 this year, may be suffering from ill health, possibly cancer.
The interview came as Russia continues its advance in Ukraine's Donbas region.
Mr Lavrov said the ""liberation"" of the eastern region was an ""unconditional priority"" for Russia.
He repeated the Kremlin's widely discredited line that Russia is fighting a ""neo-Nazi regime"".
Noting that President Putin regularly appeared in public, Mr Lavrov told TF1: ""I don't think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.""
""You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches,"" he said in comments released by the Russian foreign ministry.
""I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours despite daily opportunities to assess how anyone is looking.""
British intelligence sources were quoted telling media outlets that Mr Putin was seriously ill in the last week. However, rumours about the condition of the Russian leader, long known for his healthy lifestyle and love of sport, have surfaced periodically for years.
Western intelligence agencies have been taking a close interest in President Putin's health, both mental and physical.
This is not just because he gave the order to launch the ill-planned invasion of Ukraine, it's also due to the fact that he has almost sole authority over the use of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal.
They need to know if he is about to launch an impetuous tactical nuclear strike in Ukraine that would shatter the 77-year long absence of these weapons being used in war.
Is he mad? No. He is in full control of his faculties. But he has grown steadily angrier with the West.
Two years of Covid-inspired isolation have reinforced Putin's paranoia that everything the West and Nato does is to the detriment of Russia. But speculation in the western media that he has serious health problems veer - so far - more towards wishful thinking than anything backed up by hard medical evidence.
Asked about the human cost of the fighting, which has seen devastating artillery and rocket attacks on some urban areas, Mr Lavrov insisted Russian soldiers were ""under strict orders categorically to avoid attacks and strikes on civilian infrastructure"".
Since Russia invaded on 24 February, at least 4,031 civilians have been killed and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, and an unknown number of combatants have died or been wounded. More than 14 million people have fled their homes, with towns and cities reduced to rubble.
The fighting is now focused on the Donbas - the mining belt made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Separatists in the two regions, which historically have strong ties to Russia, broke away in 2014 and are now fighting alongside Russian troops to take full control.
Mr Lavrov told TF1 that winning in ""the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority"".
However, he added, it was up to the rest of Ukraine if people there were ""happy to return to the authority of a neo-Nazi regime that has proven it is Russophobic in essence"".
Russia has already been forced to pull back from an attempt to overrun the capital Kyiv, after been repelled by Ukrainian forces.
They have also been pushed back from the second city, Kharkiv, in recent weeks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky making a morale-boosting trip to the battle scarred city on Sunday.
Speaking in the city, he said his soldiers would defend their land ""to the last man"". ""They [the Russians] have no chance,"" he said. ""We will fight and we will definitely win.""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill.

Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian band which won this year's Eurovision Song Contest, have sold their trophy for $900,000 (£712,000; €838,000) to raise money for the war in Ukraine.
The crystal microphone was auctioned on Facebook, with the aim of buying drones for Ukraine's military.
The sale coincided with the band's appearance at a charity concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.
It aimed to raise money for medical care and supplies.
Speaking at the concert, band member Oleh Psiuk appealed for people not to get used to the war, which has left at least 4,031 civilians dead and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, along with an unknown number of combatants.
It has also forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes since Russia invaded on 24 February, with towns and cities reduced to rubble.
""I think it should be on the front pages always, until peace comes,"" said Psiuk, whose Eurovision win had been hotly tipped in the run up to the contest. Their song, Stefania, was originally written in tribute to Psiuk's mother, but emotive lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" have been re-interpreted as a rallying cry.
Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula announced that the money raised from the sale of the trophy would be used to purchase three Ukrainian-made PD-2 drones, Reuters news agency reports.

Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Back then, the 19-year-old had just put university on hold and volunteered to fight.
Last week he made a difficult journey out of the Donbas front line, using back roads at night to avoid artillery fire, to pick up supplies for his unit and to tell me what it has been like fighting the Russians.
We met in Bakhmut, a small town well within the range of Russian artillery. Some of its buildings are in ruins and the city has been almost emptied of civilians.
For three weeks, Maxsym and his comrades had fought to keep control of a position they called Serber, after a small dog they had adopted. It was in a smashed-up former factory in Rubizhne, a town that eventually fell to the Russians.
""It was like hell. There were no good positions to defend. We had been in trenches, sometimes shelters from Soviet times, and a fire station.""
His unit was targeted by tank fire about 25 times a day, he says.
""One of my friends was killed there and maybe 10 or 15 guys were injured seriously.""
Now, summer is almost on them and Ukraine's fertile black soil is bursting with life, the deadliest fighting is in Donbas. Russia's generals are learning from its enemy's victories around Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second city.
Defeat in March led the Russian army to fall back, in April and May, on what it knows best. Its forces and fearsome firepower are concentrated in a narrow sector of east Ukraine. Now it is close to forcing Ukrainian forces out of Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up Donbas. The other, Donetsk, where Ukraine has a bigger footprint, is already being hit by Russian artillery.
I first came across Maxsym, a biology student, in early March. He, and his university friend Dmytro Kisilenko, an 18-year-old studying economics, had signed up to fight shortly after Russia launched its invasion.
As they waited alongside others like them, in the bitter cold, to be bussed to their training centre, they looked like young lads off to a festival or a camping trip, except for the old Kalashnikovs they had just been issued. Witnessing 18- and 19-year-olds, full of the invincible sense that young men have, going to war in Europe, just as they had during the blood-soaked years of the 20th Century was moving, depressing, and alarming. It was a sign of the big war that was coming.
In March, Maxsym and Dmytro and all Ukrainians were adapting, the way human beings always do in war. After the first shock old lives and routines fade into a new, all-consuming version of real life. During their brief training early in March, we talked about how the war was changing everything. Maxsym already sounded old for his years.
""We can't meet our wives, our girlfriends, our children. We can't do our business, like we were doing before the invasion. But everyone understands that we have a more important mission now. And we will continue doing business, growing up our children. We will kiss our wives and girlfriends many times, but after the war.""
Their lives, those of every Ukrainian, were turned upside down, when the Russians invaded on 24 February. So have the lives of all of us who aren't Ukrainian.
Despite Russian advances, Maxsym retains an iron-clad determination to fight. His friend Dmytro, who fought in the battle for Kyiv, is remains in the capital. As they were students, service in the Donbas is not compulsory.
""As long as it's necessary to hold, we are ready to freeze in trenches, to lose our hearing. We are ready even to die there, but we will win as much time as it's necessary for the entire civilized world to beat Russia in non-military ways.""
He has no time for people calling themselves Ukraine's allies, who say they should trade territory for some kind of accommodation with Vladimir Putin's Russia.
""I think that there is no way to make a deal with Putin. Putin understands only the language of bullets, blood, war crimes and something else. It is impossible to say take this part of the land and the war will end.""
I asked Maxsym how the war was changing him. At the start of the year, he was arranging concerts and involved with youth politics in Kyiv.
""Even now I can't answer you exactly because it is very hard to understand that some of your friends, they died in your arms. It is hard to live with that fact... and when we left Rubizhne, it was hard for us to understand that we have lost the battle for this factory; for one of the key cities of Luhansk region.""
Back in March, Maxsym used to joke that he hadn't told his parents exactly what he was doing in uniform.
""Now my parents understand me 100%. I try to call them every time I can. My mama sent some uniform for me and my brothers."" His father tried to join the territorial defence in Maxsym's home town, Sumy. ""But he's 65 and too old to fight. So when they turned him down, he phoned me and says 'Maxsym, can I become a part of your unit?'
""They understand me. They support me mentally and financially.""
Donbas is full of signs that the Ukrainians expect to lose more territory to this Russian offensive. New lines of trenches have been dug in the rear. Convoys of huge, expensive tractors are being driven west. The sophisticated heavy weapons that they need to try to match and even outgun Russian firepower are arriving, but not fast enough yet to force the invaders back.
Maxsym the student has turned into a front-line soldier, engaged he believes in the mission of his life.
""We are fighting for the freedom of the entire world, the entire civilised world and if anyone thinks it is a Ukrainian-Russian war, it isn't. It is the war of the light and the darkness between the Russia and the entire world.""Maxsym Lutsyk looks older and more serious, and makes fewer jokes, than when I saw him in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met troops in the heavily shell-damaged city of Kharkiv - his first official visit to the east of the country since the Russian invasion.
He thanked the troops, handed out medals, and said they were facing an ""indescribably difficult"" situation.
Russia has resumed shelling Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, after a fortnight of comparative quiet. The industrial city is 42km (26 miles) from the Russian border.
Mr Zelensky later announced he had fired the head of the Ukraine Security Service in Kharkiv region, Roman Dudin. He accused him of not working on the city's defence.
Ukraine says Russia is still occupying a third of the Kharkiv region. Russian troops have been pushed back from the city's outskirts, but it remains within artillery range.
The heaviest fighting is now south-east of Kharkiv, as Russia uses artillery barrages and air strikes to push the Ukrainians from their remaining strongholds in the Donbas region. Kyiv's forces are putting up stiff resistance.

The US government appears close to sending a long-range multiple-rocket system (MLRS) to Ukraine.
Russia sees such deliveries of heavy weapons as a provocative escalation.
President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have appealed for the MLRS to counter Russia's offensive in the Donbas.
Kyiv's forces are using US-delivered M777 howitzers, which have a range of about 25km (16 miles). But an M270 MLRS battery can fire rockets at targets up to 300km (186km) distant, as can a similar US rocket system called M142 Himars.
They would greatly boost the Ukrainians' capabilities - even enabling them to hit targets inside Russia, though such action would risk drawing the US and its Nato allies into direct conflict with Russia.
A senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range rockets compatible with the system.
Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, engaged in a terse interview with the BBC's Clive Myrie on the Sunday Morning programme.
He said that Russia would not use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as it has very strict rules for their use, which apply mainly when the state's existence is threatened.
Asked about civilian killings in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, he said reports of war crimes there were a ""fabrication"" orchestrated by the Ukrainian side after Russia's withdrawal.
Satellite imagery appears to directly contradict this position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited troops in the Kharkiv region, on the country's battered eastern front line.
It was his first official trip outside the Kyiv region since the Russian invasion began on 24 February.
He was pictured in a bullet-proof vest surveying ruins in Kharkiv city.

The city - Ukraine's second-largest - faced intense bombardment in the war's first months, with images showing tower blocks flattened to rubble.
Russian troops were gradually pushed back from its surrounding towns during April and May, prompting some who had fled Kharkiv to return, and the metro to reopen for the first time since the invasion.

Today's visit to Kharkiv is the first time President Zelensky has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia's invasion.
He met the troops who have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine's second city. A few weeks ago, this morale-boosting visit would never have been possible.
But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, with Russian artillery barrages forcing troops to retreat in the Donbas.
With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for Ukrainians, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.
The president met Kharkiv's mayor and the regional governor to discuss reconstruction plans, reportedly urging them to ""find cool projects"" to help rehabilitate the ravaged city.
""This is a chance for such districts to have a new face,"" Mr Zelensky said.
His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said 31% of the Kharkiv region's territory was currently occupied by Russia, while 5% had been re-taken by Ukraine after being occupied earlier.
Russia is presently concentrating its offensive on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which it has vowed to seize as a key war aim.
Russian forces are trying to encircle the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. On Saturday Russia's defence ministry said it had taken the nearby town of Lyman, in Donetsk - part of the overall Donbas region.
""The situation is very difficult, especially in those areas in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions,"" Mr Zelensky said on Saturday in his daily address to the nation.
An estimated 15,000 civilians are still in Severodonetsk, where a local official said ""constant shelling"" made it hard to get in or out. The water supply is increasingly precarious.

Russia has scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, paving the way for more civilian experts to be recruited for the Ukraine conflict.
President Vladimir Putin has signed a law enabling people over 40 to enlist for the armed forces. They are expected to be people of normal working age.
Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners.
Russia is presenting it as a move to recruit more technical specialists.
The new law says specialists are required to operate high-precision weapons and ""experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45"". More medics, engineers and communications experts may also be recruited.
Ukrainian and Western military experts say Russia has suffered heavy losses in the war: about 30,000 killed, according to Ukraine, while the UK government estimates the toll at about 15,000. In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan in the 1980s totalled about 15,000.
Russia gave a total of 1,351 of its troops killed in Ukraine on 25 March, which it has not updated.
President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
But in March Russia's defence ministry admitted that some conscripts were involved in the conflict and some had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle.
Later, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that those conscripts drafted into the military this spring would not be sent to any hotspots.
Conscription, also known as the draft, is a centuries-old practice for states to require large numbers of men to serve in the military. Russia's conscription, dating back to tsarist times, obliges men aged 18 to 27 to serve one year in the military. But many get exemptions on medical grounds, or because they are students.
Russia now has more than 400,000 professional ""contract"" soldiers in its 900,000-strong active armed forces. It can also mobilise about two million reservists, military analysts say.
Ukraine's army is a lot smaller - it has an estimated 200,000 active troops and 900,000 reservists, though it has boosted those numbers through mass mobilisation since Russia invaded on 24 February.
Under its current martial law, Ukraine forbids men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, demanding that they stay and fight. So women, children and the elderly form the vast majority of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries.
Ukraine's military says it is not yet conscripting women, but some can be drafted exceptionally if their skills in medicine, IT or other areas are needed. Ukraine has also recruited several thousand foreign volunteer soldiers.
Many countries have military conscription, though the rules vary widely. They include Israel, Turkey, Iran, Sweden and Georgia.
The UK and US are among many other countries which have fully professional armies, as well as reservists who can be called up in an emergency. The UK had conscription in both world wars, and the US had the draft during the Vietnam War.Russia has scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, paving the way for more civilian experts to be recruited for the Ukraine conflict.

The leaders of France and Germany have urged Russia's Vladimir Putin to hold ""direct [and] serious negotiations"" with Ukraine's president, the German chancellor's office said.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz spoke to Mr Putin by phone for 80 minutes.
The pair ""insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops"", the chancellor's office said.
Russia's leader said Moscow was open to resuming dialogue with Kyiv, according to the Kremlin.
It did not mention the possibility of direct talks between Mr Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Ukrainian president earlier said he was not ""eager"" for talks, but added they would likely be necessary to end the conflict.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held multiple rounds of talks remotely and in person since Russia invaded on 24 February, but efforts have stalled of late.
France and Germany also urged Mr Putin to release 2,500 Ukrainian fighters taken as prisoners-of-war at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
The sprawling factory became the last holdout in the southern port city, which endured relentless bombardment from Russian forces and now lies in ruins.
Earlier this month, Moscow officials said the last fighters defending the plant had surrendered, while President Zelensky said they had been given permission to leave.
Russia has previously said more than 900 of the fighters were moved to a reopened prison colony in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk. A smaller number with serious wounds were taken to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Donetsk.
Ukraine hopes they will be released as part of a prisoner exchange - but Russia has not confirmed that. Some Russian lawmakers argue the fighters should be tried or even executed.
Also during the call, the French and German leaders asked Mr Putin to lift Russia's blockade of the Ukrainian port of Odesa, to allow for grain exports.
The Kremlin said Mr Putin offered to look at options, to help address the risk of a global food crisis - but demanded that the West lift sanctions.
Russia also warned France and Germany against increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine, saying that could increase instability still further.
Analysis by Joe Inwood, Ukraine Correspondent
To read the Kremlin's report of the call between Presidents Putin and Macron and Chancellor Scholz, Russia is engaged in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Its actions in the southern port of Mariupol - a city that has been reduced to rubble - are all about ""establishing peaceful life"" and ""liberation"".
It is a stark contrast not just with the readout from the EU allies - who said the focus was on the welfare of the 2,500 prisoners-of-war who surrendered - but with the evidence of all independent observers.  There are multiple, credible reports of war crimes carried out by occupying Russian forces.
Despite that, the fact that the two most powerful leaders in the EU are holding direct talks with Russia's president is significant.
Their call for a diplomatic solution - even as Russian forces advance in the Donbas - is not supported by all Western allies, who fear it could put pressure on Ukraine to cede territory in return for peace.
It all comes as Moscow claims to have captured the crucial crossroads city of Lyman - and continues its assault of Severodonetsk. The industrial city has been encircled for days - with reports that Ukraine may order a strategic withdrawal of its forces.
It is too soon to say that today's attempts at diplomacy represent a fracturing of the Western alliance… but different positions are beginning to emerge.
In an operational update issued on Sunday, Ukrainian military officials said that intense fighting has continued around the city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost place still under Ukrainian control.
The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said two civilians were killed overnight as Russia continued firing heavily on the city with missile and artillery strikes.
On Friday, officials said two-thirds of its perimeter was surrounded by Russian forces.
Mr Haidai had said Ukrainian troops could be forced to withdraw from Severodonetsk, observing: ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave.""
But Yelyzaveta Yasko, a local MP for the region, said on Sunday that Kyiv's troops remained entrenched across the city.
""Severodonetsk for Putin became like one of the places that he really wants to take because he believes that it will give him military power over the whole Donbas region but, as we see that no matter how hard the battles are, still they didn't take it over, all of it,"" she said.
""But for me very painful to say because we still know and hear about the numbers of the victims that are happening there everyday and unfortunately the situation becomes worse also from the humanitarian side,"" Ms Yasko observed.
In comments to the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the Russian invasion of his country had destroyed more than 25,000 km (15,000 miles) of roads, several hundred bridges, and 12 airports.
More than 100 educational institutions, over 500 medical facilities, and 200 factories have also been ruined or damaged, he said.

He called for Russia to be forced to pay for ""the destruction it has created"", saying frozen Russian assets should be transferred to Ukraine to fund reconstruction work."

Fighting in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is at ""maximum intensity"" according to the country's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar, with Russian troops storming several Ukrainian positions simultaneously.
She warned of ""an extremely difficult"" stage of the war ahead, adding that casualties on the Ukrainian side were ""unavoidable"". But she ruled out any concessions from Kyiv.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Ukraine to accept ""realities on the ground"", in what is seen as a reference to the areas Moscow has seized since the start of its invasion on 24 February.
The Kremlin also signalled its readiness to help alleviate a growing food crisis - but only if Western sanctions against Russia were lifted.
Here are some of the main developments over the past 24 hours.
Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of ""liberating"" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas.
Having abandoned his campaign to capture the capital Kyiv and second city Kharkiv, President Vladimir Putin is now looking for military victory in the largely Russian-speaking east, where he falsely accuses Ukraine of committing genocide.
Achieving his goals in Donbas is the minimum the Russian president needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success.
Russian forces already control large swathes of the south.
Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"".

Russia relies on conscription to boost troop numbers in the armed forces. Military service lasts 12 months and, with some exceptions, is mandatory for Russian men aged between 18 and 27.
After initially announcing that only professional soldiers were taking part in the operation in Ukraine, Russia later admitted that conscripts had in fact been sent across the border to fight.
The BBC has spoken to one woman who discovered after making an official complaint that her two sons - both conscripts - had been sent to Ukraine.
""They allowed me to come and take my younger son home for the day,"" says Marina, which is not her real name. ""While I was driving to collect him, I called and asked him asked if there was anything he needed. 'Mum, I don't need anything,' he replied, 'just you'.""
""The lads that came back from there were so thin, dirty and exhausted. Their clothes were torn. My son said: 'It's better that you don't know what happened there.' But all that mattered to me was that he had come back alive.""

Narva is a strange place, almost an aberration. On the very edge of Nato's eastern flank, it is Estonia's third biggest city - but its population of nearly 60,000 is 97% Russian-speaking, making it the largest Russian-speaking city in the EU.
It sits on the western bank of the River Narva that flows into the Baltic Sea. On the eastern bank is Russia. To a first-time visitor it feels like a classic Cold War frontier. Two giant fortresses face each other on opposing sides of the river, with the international border running down the middle.

Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin. What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world?
In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region.
Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked.
Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound.
""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out.""

Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of ""liberating"" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas.

Achieving his goals in the east is the minimum he needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success.
Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military ""will fight for every centimetre of our land"".
When Russia's leader talks about Donbas, he is not just referring to Ukraine's coal and steel-producing area. He is highlighting two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia.
Donbas is predominantly Russian-speaking and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, its proxy forces captured more than a third of Ukraine's east in a war that never came to an end.
The Russian proxies created so-called people's republics that nobody recognised and Russia now plans to capture the rest of the east.
Luhansk and Donetsk may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. One Ukrainian opinion poll in May 2022 suggested 82% of Ukrainians in territory seized by Russia since the 24 February invasion had a negative attitude to Moscow.
A month into the invasion, Russia scaled back its ambitions to capture the capital, Kyiv, and instead moved its focus to Donbas. By late March it claimed to have controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk, although that was certainly an overstatement.
Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky declared in April that Russian forces had begun the battle for Donbas and that Ukrainian forces had long prepared for it. Russia is far from subduing the entire area, although if it captures the two big twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, then all of Luhansk would be under its control.
Just before he launched the war, President Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent of Ukraine, not just the limited statelets created by Moscow-backed proxies.
He has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. The conflict there has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2014, but three-quarters of those were combatants and the 420km line of contact didn't change significantly after 2015.
As Russia's failure to capture Kyiv became clear, it switched attention to ""achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas"".
Moscow's likely next step would be to annexe Donbas and other adjacent areas, exactly as President Putin did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014.
US officials believe annexation is on the cards, and Russia's puppet leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, has said referendums would make sense when Russian forces complete the capture of both regions. The outside world would regard any vote as a sham, but he sees the result as ""obvious"".
Russia's military is pushing forward in Luhansk and Donetsk and digging in in areas of the south, having taken control of the region of Kherson, to the north and west of Crimea, as well as part of Zaporizhzhia. Russia has already secured a land corridor from Crimea to the Russian border with the capture of Mariupol, and it has control of the water supply to Crimea as well as Europe's biggest power plant.
So would victory in Donbas be sufficient for Vladimir Putin?
It is impossible to know what he is thinking and what his relationship is with his military command, says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. But if Russia is successful in Luhansk and Donetsk, then he believes Russia will assess the state of the Ukrainian forces: ""If the Russians feel that they are able to gain more of their stated goals, I suspect they will go for them.""
Leading Russian figures including Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev have made clear they are not chasing deadlines but are prepared for a protracted war.
If they are successful in Donbas, they may have designs on extending gains in the south. Russian troops have fired missiles at the big city of Zaporizhzhia and President Putin has signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports.
One Russian general has suggested the aim is to conquer Ukraine's Black Sea coast to the west beyond Odesa, but for now that seems little more than an aspiration.
For weeks Russian forces have bombarded Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Ukrainian forces have retreated from Lyman. They have also broken through at Popasna and are threatening key Ukrainian arterial routes and supply lines, particularly the roads from Lysychansk to Bakhmut and the major M03 motorway from Slovyansk to Bakhmut.
The battle for Luhansk has entered a decisive phase, says regional military administration head Serhiy Haidai.
Many of these towns have already experienced years of war since Russia's proxies first seized large parts of Donbas. Severodonetsk is normally a city of 100,000 people - 15,000 were still there, mainly in bomb shelters, as Russian troops advanced in late May.
Maryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk weeks before: ""They attacked hospitals and residential buildings,"" she said.
Another big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. Capturing Kramatorsk, just to the south, is also a big objective.
But Russian progress has been slow and Ukrainian defence officials believe they are running low on high-precision weapons.
""This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,"" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.
The Russians have already succeeded in blocking most rail traffic to the east. That was the fastest route for fleeing civilians but also the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry. Train lines in and out of Donbas have been cut and the only services remaining are going to Pokrovsk.
Serhiy Haidai believes Russia's leader is now determined to capture the Luhansk region, no matter what the cost - in money, soldiers' lives or military equipment.
At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has.
President Zelensky revealed on 22 May that between 50 to 100 soldiers may be dying every day in their defence of eastern Ukraine. That would indicate an even larger number of wounded and Sam Cranny-Evans believes it is likely that some brigades are no longer combat effective.
""It is hard to assess whether or not they are in a good place right now. If the above attrition rates are accurate, it could be very problematic.""
US officials have estimated that some 93 Russian battalion tactical groups were operating in the east, each numbering 700 to 900 men. But they too have suffered from high losses and low morale. Their units are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas, many under duress, as well as the broader Russian army.
Russia studies analyst Michael Kofman says the military balance in the war overall weighs in Ukraine's favour, because of manpower availability and access to Western military support, but in Donbas it is too early to say how the war will go: ""Ukraine may lose territory in the short term, but Russia faces major problems with sustaining its military effort in the long term, or holding on to gains"".
That is why Ukraine is calling on its Western allies to speed up deliveries of heavy weapons including long-range artillery.
Life in the Russian proxy-held areas of Ukraine is far quieter than elsewhere in the east, although the so-called people's republics have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say dozens of civilians have died since mid-February. Far more have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainian-controlled territory.
One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that men of military age were required to join the local Russian proxy militia, so anyone who wanted to avoid mobilisation was in hiding. People called it ""mogilisation"" after the Russian word mogila which means grave, she said.
""There are many dead and many funerals. Wives often do not know anything about the fate of their mobilised husbands.""
Asked about the prospect of a vote on joining Russia, she said people understood they had no real say in the matter: ""It's like a train you can't get off.""Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of ""liberating"" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas.

A woman who fled Ukraine has said she feels ""isolated"" after failing to find a vegan-friendly host.
Oksana Kopanitsyna said being in the same room as someone eating or preparing meat was like ""someone was cutting a child in front of you"".
Now living in a bed and breakfast in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly county, she said her beliefs were being tested as she looks for her own place to live.
The charity Vegan Society said this problem was not uncommon.
Oksana was living in Kyiv when she decided it was no longer safe to stay and began her long journey through Europe to the UK.
She left her family, her job and her friends behind due to the war.
Her grandparents had told her stories of starvation from the past, and when supermarket shelves began to empty, she became ""very scared"".
She is dependent on medication and began her journey to Wales in early March, spending nights on train station floors, camping and sleeping on people's sofas.
Oksana wants to work and rent her own home, but while waiting for a bank account and job responses, she said she had no choice but to live in the accommodation provided for her.
Originally from Donetsk, Oksana made connections with vegans across the world and was offered a place to stay in south Wales with a friend and his family.
However, she said she was asked to leave abruptly after discussions about veganism and animal by-products, such as leather.
Since then she has been trying to find a home that caters to her needs but said it had been a challenge.
""With like 6% of Wales vegan and then those willing to take me on, my chances are probably under 1%,"" she said.
Oksana said she feels ""traumatised"" watching people eat meat.
She has said she would stay in any home she is offered, but cannot share a fridge with non-vegans or be in the room when they are cooking or eating animal products.
""I will have my own fridge I will keep in my room and I going to pay them for electricity,"" she said.
""How would it be for you if someone was cutting a child in front of you or keeping body parts in the fridge and you just see a hand or half of face? That is what it feels like for me.""
She said Caerphilly council had been ""so helpful"" and were trying to find her a family to suit her needs but said she knows it comes last due to the number of people looking for a host family.
""It's hard for people from Ukraine already because lots of people try to take advantage, renting small rooms for hundreds or in places far away from transportation,"" she said.
""And so, even a regular person it's hard but, for me, it's even harder.""
A vegan is someone who doesn't eat or use animal products.
Unlike a vegetarian diet - where people do not eat meat or fish - a vegan diet avoids all animal products like dairy, eggs and even honey, as well as meat and fish.
Some people prefer to call this way of eating 'a plant-based diet'.
Following a vegan lifestyle also means only using or buying cosmetics and clothes free from animal products.
Research by the Vegan Society found the number of vegans in Great Britain increased from 150,000 in 2006 to 540,000 in 2016.
Many believe the number of people who call themselves vegans could now be in the millions.
The charity Vegan Society said someone's veganism needs to be taken as seriously as religious and allergy requirements and it was understandable a vegan refugee would want to live ""in a plant-based household where their values and views are shared by others"".
It added: ""Being forced to leave the entire life they know behind is horrific enough, so finding somewhere they can feel safe and respected in an otherwise unfamiliar community, where they can comfortably sustain the values they hold close, shouldn't be a privilege.
""It would be great to see more available support to accommodate vegans, whose ethical beliefs fall within the protection of the law just as those with religious beliefs, so it's important their views are acknowledged and respected in the same way.""A woman who fled Ukraine has said she feels ""isolated"" after failing to find a vegan-friendly host.

""It would be great to see more available support to accommodate vegans, whose ethical beliefs fall within the protection of the law just as those with religious beliefs, so it's important their views are acknowledged and respected in the same way."""

The leaders of France and Germany had an 80-minute phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and urged him to launch ""direct, serious negotiations"" with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz ""insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops,"" according to Germany's account of the call.
Russia's president said Moscow was open to resuming dialogue with Kyiv, according to the Kremlin.
It did not mention the possibility of direct Putin-Zelensky talks.
The Ukrainian president earlier said he was not ""eager"" for talks, but added they would likely be necessary to end the conflict.
France and Germany also urged Mr Putin to release 2,500 Ukrainian fighters who were taken as prisoners of war at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
The sprawling factory became the last holdout in the southern port city, which endured relentless bombardment from Russian forces and now lies in ruins.
Russia has previously said more than 900 of the fighters were moved to a reopened prison colony in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk. A smaller number with serious wounds were taken to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Donetsk region.

Also on Saturday, Russia scrapped its age limit for professional soldiers, meaning people over 40 can enlist for the armed forces.
Previously the army had age limits of 18-40 years for Russians and 18-30 for foreigners.
President Putin has avoided large-scale conscription for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
But in March Russia's defence ministry admitted that some conscripts were involved in the conflict and some had been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry stressed that it was not official policy to send conscripts into battle.
Ukrainian and Western military experts say Russia has suffered heavy losses in the war: about 30,000 killed, according to Ukraine, while the UK government estimates the toll at about 15,000. In comparison, Soviet losses in nine years of war in Afghanistan were about 15,000.
Russia gave a total of 1,351 dead on 25 March, which it has not updated.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have fled to Armenia, in a bid to avoid President Putin's crackdown on dissent.
With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights to the capital Yerevan from Moscow. Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them.
Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"", and for Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, Russia no longer seemed a safe place to live.
""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said Yura. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested.""
Some Ukrainian families have spent more than three months living underground in a metro station in the country's second city of Kharkiv.
With no fresh air or access to washing facilities, disease has spread easily and people have suffered from illnesses including Covid-19, Rotavirus and heart and liver problems.
After months of intense fighting, Ukrainian forces have pushed Moscow's forces away from the city and back into Russian territory.
But the people here say intense fighting has destroyed their homes and that, despite the metro having reopened, they have nowhere else to go.
One man, 45-year-old Arif Bagirov, has told the BBC about his bike ride like no other.
He managed to flee the heavily-bombed eastern city of Severodonetsk by cycling - and dodging Russian shells and warplanes.
""There was a lot of firing, and at least two air strikes near me,"" he said, recounting his 70km (43-mile) bike ride to the city of Bakhmut.
Mr Bagirov said it was easier to avoid Russian warplanes, because he could hear them coming from a distance.
""I found a ditch to lie in, and that's where I laid until they had gone past.""

A couple trying to sponsor a refugee boy stuck in Holland say Boris Johnson's open letter to Ukrainian children is ""galling and hypocritical"".
Seventeen-year-old Andrii has been ""in limbo"" in the Netherlands for two months with his sponsor Joseph Kleijnen due to visa processing delays.
He said he felt ""forgotten"" after Mr Johnson told the children of Ukraine ""we in the UK will never forget you"".
The government said it was ""doing all we can to support new arrivals"".
""I don't see any deeds that are actually approving what he said in that letter,"" said the teenager, whose parents are both military doctors in Ukraine.
""I haven't heard anything from the United Kingdom in the past two months.""
Mr Kleijnen, 59, who lives in Sunk Island, East Yorkshire, with his wife Jeanette, 56, added: ""[They are] very empty words.
""It would be much more helpful if Andrii and the many, many other children who are in his position would actually get their visa and be in a safe and secure place.""
Andrii fled Ukraine alone hours after bombs landed near his hometown of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, the same day the couple applied to sponsor him under the Homes4Ukraine scheme.
Mr Kleijnen flew to Amsterdam on 22 March to collect him after submitting a visa application and the pair have since been stuck in the Dutch country.
All three said they were ""fed up, frustrated and just really disillusioned with this whole process"", with Mrs Kleijnen describing it as being ""an abyss"".
She said Wednesday was the first time they had received any communication from the Home Office, which informed them Andrii's application had ""now been passed to the decision-making centre"".
""What that means and what the next step is, we have no idea,"" she said. ""I don't know what the end is.""
In a letter tweeted on Monday, the prime minister told the children of Ukraine ""you are not alone"".
""It was galling to read the letter that Boris Johnson penned,"" said Mrs Kleijnen.
""What does that mean if we can't help somebody who's got a valid application and he's trying to get into this country with valid sponsors who've been checked and our home has been checked.
""We have everything in place and nothing is happening.
""It's frustrating, it's hypocritical and it's irritating and I'm trying not to get angry.""
The couple, who were appointed as Andrii's guardians, said they thought the visa application would be processed quicker in the Netherlands than in Ukraine's neighbouring country, Poland.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61583492;2022-05-25;How can Ukraine export its harvest to the world?;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin. What can be done to get the food to people who desperately need it, as prices soar around the world?
In early February, Nadiya Stetsiuk was looking forward to a profitable year. The weather had been good in 2021 and she saw bumper harvests of corn, wheat and sunflower seeds on her small farm in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region.
Prices on the international market were high and rising every day so she held on to some of her stock, to sell later. Then Russia attacked.
Her region hasn't seen the worst of the fighting - like 80% of the country's farmland, it's still under Ukrainian control - but the impact on her farm has been profound.
""Since the invasion, we haven't been able to sell any grain at all. The price here is now half what it was before the war,"" says Mrs Stetsiuk. ""There might be a food crisis in Europe and the world but it's gridlock here because we can't get this food out.""
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has described as ""blackmail"" an offer from Russia to lift its blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
Ukraine punches far above its weight as a food exporter, contributing 42% of the sunflower oil traded on the global market, 16% of the maize and 9% of the wheat.
Some countries depend heavily on it. Lebanon imports 80% of its wheat from Ukraine and India 76% of its sunflower oil.
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), which feeds people on the brink of starvation in countries such as Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan, sources 40% of its wheat from the country.
Even before the war, the world's food supply was precarious. Drought affected wheat and vegetable oil crops in Canada last year, and corn and soybean yields in South America.
Covid had a big impact too. In Indonesia and Malaysia labour shortages meant lower harvests of palm oil, which pushed up vegetable oil prices globally.
At the beginning of this year, the price of many of the world's staple foods were reaching all-time highs. Many hoped that crops from Ukraine could help make up the global shortfall.
But Russia's invasion has prevented that. The Ukrainian agriculture ministry says 20 million tonnes of grain are now stuck in the country.
Before the war, 90% of Ukraine's exports left via deep ports in the Black Sea, which can load tankers large enough to travel long distances - to China or India - and still make a profit. But all are now closed. Russia has seized most of Ukraine's coastline and blockaded the rest with a fleet of at least 20 vessels, including four submarines.
WFP head David Beasley has called for the international community to organise a convoy to break this blockade.
""Without understanding from Russia, militarily there is so much that could go wrong,"" says Jonathan Bentham, maritime defence analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A convoy would require significant air, land and sea power, he says, and would be politically complicated.
""Ideally to keep tensions low, you'd ask countries on the Black Sea, such as Romania and Bulgaria, to do it. But they probably don't have the capability. Then you'd have to consider bringing in Nato members outside of the Black Sea.""
That would put Turkey, which controls the straits into the Black Sea, in a difficult position. It has already said it will restrict entry to warships.
Russia's offer to open a corridor through the Black Sea for food shipments, in return for an easing of sanctions, came as the European Union was discussing on Wednesday a fresh package of sanctions and showed no sign of changing course.
Even if the war ended tomorrow it could take months or years to render the Black Sea safe, Mr Bentham says, as Ukraine has defended its coastline with mines and strategically sunken ships.
For now, food can only be taken out of Ukraine over land or on barges via the Danube river.
Last week, the EU announced plans to help by investing billions of euros in infrastructure. But Mrs Stetsiuk's neighbour, Kees Huizinga - who owns and farms 15,000 hectares - says it's not doing enough.
He's been trying to transport goods since the start of the war, and is exasperated by the mountain of paperwork the EU requires, which he says has created queues at the border up to 25km (16 miles) long.
""It's just paper, it's not like they are actually taking samples of the corn. You just have to have the paper,"" he says.
On 18 May, two days after the EU announcement, customs authorities asked his drivers for two forms that they had never seen before. ""The border is not getting easier, on the contrary it's getting more bureaucratic,"" he says.
In the past three weeks Mr Huizinga has exported 150 tonnes of grain. He could get the same amount through the port of Odesa in a few hours.
""Open the borders,"" Mr Huizinga implores the EU, ""just let the stuff through.""
The main route out of the country now is rail. But Ukraine's rail system is wider than the EU's, which means loads have to be transferred to new wagons at the border. The average waiting time is 16 days but it can take up to 30.
Though the global conversation around food shortages is largely about wheat, most of the grain leaving Ukraine at the moment is corn. And that is for two reasons, according to Elena Neroba, Ukrainian grain analyst at the brokerage, Maxigrain.
She believes Ukrainian farmers are hesitant to sell wheat because they are haunted by the memory of the Holodomor, a famine created by Stalin in 1932 in which millions of Ukrainians died. Corn, on the other hand, is not as widely eaten in Ukraine.
The other factor, she says is demand. Europe doesn't buy much Ukrainian wheat, it's self-sufficient. And it's difficult to move this wheat on beyond the EU, as ports in Poland and Romania are not equipped to export large volumes of grain.
""By July, EU countries will be busy exporting their own summer harvests and will have even less capacity to handle Ukraine's food,"" Ms Neroba says.
Time is running out to solve the problem. Storage facilities are full and the summer harvest of wheat, barley and rapeseed is weeks away.
Mrs Stetsiuk still has about 40% of last year's harvest stored on her farm and little room for next season's.
""We don't want to waste it. We know how important it is for the West, for Africa, for Asia,"" she says. ""That's the fruit of our labour and people need it.""
If she can't sell her stock, she can't afford to plant this autumn. She hopes the international community can help finance Ukrainian farmers store grain and to plant again.
If they don't, she says, grain shortages next year will be even worse.
Many wheat crops are in particularly bad shape right now. In Central Europe, the US, India, Pakistan and North Africa, dry weather means yields are set to be low. In Ukraine by contrast, the weather for wheat has been good.
Mrs Stetsiuk started her farm with her late husband 30 years ago, as Ukraine was emerging from the ashes of the USSR. They were the first in their region to buy farmland and became a proud farming family in the process. Her two daughters and her son are all involved.
""We want to keep doing it. We want to help, providing food to the people.""
In a matter of months, she says, Russia has taken them back at least 20 years.Ukrainian farmers have 20 million tonnes of grain they cannot get to international markets, and a new harvest is about to begin.

Russian forces have reached the outskirts of a key city in the Donbas region, Severodonetsk, which Ukraine says is under 24-hour a day bombardment as Russia attempts to take full control.
But reports that Russia controls a vital arterial road south-west of the city are untrue, a Ukrainian official has told the BBC.
""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said.

He's been close to the front line in Donbas, hearing from civilians caught up in the fighting.

""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive,"" he said.

Russia has a proud slogan: ""we don't abandon our own"". It is used to help justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where, according to Vladimir Putin, Russian speakers need protection from a neo-Nazi regime.
But it is Ukrainian authorities, not Russian, who are trying to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers who died on the battlefields near Kyiv.
Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back.
""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies.""
But the delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia, and the BBC has heard from several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield.
Russia has offered to provide safe passage to vessels carrying food from Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions, according to Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko cited by the Interfax news agency.
Before the invasion, Ukraine's fertile fields provided grain to countries around the world via its ports on the Black Sea. But Russia has imposed a naval blockade, making it impossible for the grain and other important food products to leave Ukraine.
The blockade is one reason for the rising food prices around the world.
The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains.Russian forces have reached the outskirts of a key city in the Donbas region, Severodonetsk, which Ukraine says is under 24-hour a day bombardment as Russia attempts to take full control.

""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies.""
But the delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia, and the BBC has heard from several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield.
Russia has offered to provide safe passage to vessels carrying food from Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions, according to Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko cited by the Interfax news agency.
Before the invasion, Ukraine's fertile fields provided grain to countries around the world via its ports on the Black Sea. But Russia has imposed a naval blockade, making it impossible for the grain and other important food products to leave Ukraine.
The blockade is one reason for the rising food prices around the world.
The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains."

Former President Donald Trump has called on US lawmakers to prioritise funding for school security over sending military aid to Ukraine.
Speaking at a pro-gun conference, Mr Trump questioned how the US ""has $40 billion to send to Ukraine"" but cannot ensure security in schools.
The meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest US gun group, is taking place in Houston.
The intervention comes days after 21 people died in a Texas school shooting.
""Before we nation-build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation,"" Mr Trump said in Friday's speech, drawing loud applause.
Earlier this month, the US Congress overwhelmingly voted to send nearly $40bn (£31bn) in military aid to Ukraine. In total, US lawmakers have sent about $54bn to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.
""Congress should vote immediately to take back every penny of unused Covid relief money,"" Mr Trump went on. ""Take it back from the states and use that money to quickly establish impenetrable security at every school all across our land.""
Mr Trump rejected calls for tightened gun controls, saying decent Americans should be allowed firearms to defend themselves against ""evil"".
He instead proposed a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of school safety, with fortified single points of entry including metal detectors and at least one armed police officer on every campus. He accused Democrats of stonewalling such security measures.
The former Republican president began his speech by reading out the names of the Uvalde shooting victims, with each marked by a bell toll.
The annual conference of the NRA, which has five million members, is taking place 280 miles (450 km) from Uvalde, the scene of the worst school shooting in the US in a decade.
Ahead of the event, several conservative speakers and musical performers announced they were backing out - including Senator John Cornyn and the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Uvalde attack.
Mr Trump hit out at those who withdrew, telling the crowd: ""Unlike some, I didn't disappoint you by not showing up.""
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who had been slated to speak in person at the event, instead told the crowd via videolink that gun laws are ineffective at preventing mass shootings.
""There are thousands of laws on the books across the country that limit the owning or using of firearms - laws that have not stopped madmen from carrying out evil acts on innocent people and peaceful communities,"" Mr Abbott said.
""In Uvalde, the gunman committed a felony under Texas law before he even pulled the trigger. It is a felony to possess a firearm on school premises. But that did not stop him.""
Mr Trump called in his speech for the US to ""drastically change our approach to mental health"".
He made a similar call during his presidency, even while critics at the time accused him of trying to defund medical programmes that included mental healthcare.
Before Mr Trump spoke, Texas Senator Ted Cruz blamed mass shootings mainly on absent fathers, declining church attendance, social media and video games.
Mr Cruz also reiterated his pro-gun stance and urged delegates ""not react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the Constitution or infringing on the rights of our law-abiding citizens"".
""If the left disarms America, those crimes would no longer be stopped,"" Mr Cruz said. ""Many more single moms in subways would be assaulted or raped or murdered. Home invasions would turn much more deadly, as only the criminals would have guns. And far more children would be murdered.""
Outside the venue, hundred of protesters gathered to oppose the NRA. They held signs saying ""NRA kill kids"", ""protect children not guns"" and held crosses and photos of shooting victims.Former President Donald Trump has called on US lawmakers to prioritise funding for school security over sending military aid to Ukraine.

A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces.
""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai.
Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target.
If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.
Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through.
Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed.
If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.
The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters.
""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said.
American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant.
""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC.
Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas.
Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"".
President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down.
The Ukrainian leader appealed to European countries to show unity in the face of Russian aggression and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the West to ""kill Russian exports"" by stopping all trade.
As well as bombarding towns and cities in the east, Russia launched its biggest missile attack yet on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia at dawn on Wednesday, killing one person and damaging more than 60 homes and a shopping centre.
In a clear statement of intent that Russia's long-term plans extend across the south, as well as eastern Ukraine, President Putin signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports.
While the region of Kherson is under Russian occupation, only parts of the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzhia are in Russian hands. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, declared on Wednesday that the entire region should become a fully-fledged part of Russia, rather than a so-called people's republic.

European governments should ""stay strong"" even though the Ukraine war would hurt their economies, the Klitschko brothers told the BBC.
Former heavyweight champions Wladimir and Vitali were in Davos to encourage world leaders to support the Ukraine's fight against Russia.
They acknowledged that some European leaders may be wavering in their commitment to the cause.
But they thanked the UK for its support, urging, “please don’t stop"".
Ukraine’s Klitschko brothers dominated the sport of boxing for a decade. Both were world heavyweight champions, and between them they fought 40 title bouts.
Vitali Klitschko, the older of the two, turned to politics when his boxing career ended, and was elected mayor of Kyiv in 2014.
They are now bringing the power of their global fame to bear on another, even tougher fight. The brothers visited the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to urge the business and political leaders gathered there to step up their efforts in the struggle against Russian aggression.
“We are asking for help and support, we are getting some of it. But it is not enough because it’s never enough as long as this war is still going,” Wladimir Klitschko told the BBC.
Sanctions needed to go further, he said. “We need to walk the talk and not just say it but actually do it. Because very often it’s sad but in reality it’s not working.
""And that is why it is important to isolate Russia financially, economically, because every cent that they are getting is getting in the budgets to finance the war in Ukraine right now and finance their soldiers and buy more weapons that are killing us, Ukrainians.”
Wladimir told assembled reporters from the Swiss press that the country should set aside its long-standing tradition of neutrality, which has seen it prohibit Germany from supplying its stocks of Swiss-made ammunition to Ukrainian army.
The Klitschkos were at Davos town hall to meet a group of Ukrainian refugees who are staying in the area, before appearing on stage at the World Economic Forum.
Asked whether some nations, notably France and Germany, were beginning to waver in their support, and consider making concessions to Putin in a peace deal, Wladimir said: “I see that, and I tell to every politician, right now the world [is] black and white, and you have to decide: you on the side of democracy or peace, or you on the side of the dictator, the aggressors, Russian Federation?”
Vitali acknowledged that the world would pay a price to support Ukraine. “It is a very painful question for the economy but we pay to stop the war…with human lives.”
The brothers both thanked the British people for the support they have shown.
“I want to say thank you so much for all the support that has been provided since the beginning of the war,” said Wladimir. “And it is not just verbally, it is the financial side, military equipment, support for the refugees that have been taken, so we feel this it is very important for us. Please don’t stop, don’t stop supporting us don’t stop helping us as long as this war is still going.”

""Liar! Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage. Grey-haired trade unionists held signs that read ""no weapons, no war"".
Usually a workers' rights demonstration in Düsseldorf would be a cosy affair for a chancellor from the centre-left Social Democrats. But these left-wing activists were outraged that his government was sending weapons to Ukraine.
""It's cynical to tell Ukrainians they should defend themselves against Putin's aggression without weapons,"" he shouted back, battling to make himself heard over the booing.
However vocal, these German unionists are in a minority. Home and abroad, Mr Scholz has come under attack for not sending Ukraine enough weapons.
Leading politicians from across Germany's political spectrum accuse Mr Scholz of acting as a brake on arms deliveries.
Poland's President Andrzej Duda has accused Berlin of breaking its word, saying that modern German Leopard tanks, promised by Berlin to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent to Ukraine, have not arrived.
Internationally there is a perception that Germany does not want to arm Ukraine.
""I don't understand why it's so complicated,"" said a frustrated Ukrainian foreign minister this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser went on social media to plead for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS).
In reality Berlin is supplying large amounts of weapons; not as much as the US, but comparable to other European countries. Experts say Germany ranks somewhere in the middle.
The German parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of supplying heavy weapons. Most mainstream politicians and almost all parties support the move, including Olaf Scholz's own Social Democrat SPD, his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal FDP, as well as the conservative opposition.
The far-right AfD and radical left-wing Die Linke are the only parties to object to arming Ukraine. Both are struggling in the polls and are fractured by internal spats.
There have been objections to weapons deliveries in the media debate, such as a public letter written by some academics and media personalities. But none of the signatories have political influence, and few have any expertise on Russia or Ukraine.
And yet, despite the consensus in the political mainstream, Mr Scholz still appears hesitant.
In speeches he repeats set phrases like ""Putin must not win, Ukraine must exist"". Inexplicably he never talks about Ukraine winning the war.
Unlike many leading German politicians, he still hasn't visited Kyiv since Russia's invasion, saying that going for a ""photo-op"" is pointless.
This has sparked outrage in Germany, with photos shared on social media of Mr Scholz shaking hands with various dignitaries all over the world, clearly for photo-ops.
On the one hand Mr Scholz pledges full support for Ukraine. On the other, the security council that he chairs hasn't signed off requests for modern Leopard or Marder tanks which suppliers say they could send and which Ukraine wants.
This week Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliament's defence committee and defence expert for the liberal FDP, a party in Scholz's own governing coalition, said it was unacceptable that Germany was seen in the world as putting the brakes on military help for Ukraine ""simply because we're not able to communicate properly and organise ourselves"".
She wants a transparent list of what Germany is delivering and better coordination, saying the chancellor ""can pull all the strings"" when it comes to arms deliveries. ""I'm trying to understand why he doesn't. Is out of conviction or because of his party?""
Certainly in polls, Social Democrat voters are some of the most likely to oppose arming Ukraine. The SPD traditionally believes peace in Europe can only be achieved by working with, not against Moscow. Some influential party figures would rather focus on a peace deal with Vladimir Putin and believe sending weapons to Ukraine might escalate the conflict.
Overall the public mood is divided, febrile and changeable:
Either way people are confused.
Until recently Mr Scholz said sending tanks would mean escalation and that Germany didn't have enough tanks to send anyway.
Then he said tanks could be sent to Poland, but those don't seem to have arrived and it's not clear what the agreement was anyway. Now the message is that Berlin is sending Gepard defensive tanks directly to Ukraine, but not Leopard or Marder offensive tanks, because of a supposed informal agreement with Nato.
Other countries don't seem to have such fraught public rows about the details of arms deliveries.
But the lack of clarity is making people increasingly nervous and undermining trust in Mr Scholz's leadership. His ratings are falling and his SPD party has lost two major state elections in the last month.
His aim appears to be a conciliatory middle ground of compromise to avoid escalation, understandable given Germany's traumatic war-torn 20th Century. But the danger is that by trying to keep everyone happy, Mr Scholz satisfies no-one - least of all Ukraine.""Liar! Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage.

Preparations were under way for a pop-up Russian wedding in the courtyard of a disused textile factory in the remote Armenian town of Tumanyan. Most of the guests were artists and musicians who had fled Russia.
Bride and groom Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, moved here to escape Russia's crackdown on anti-war protesters.
""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said the bridegroom. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested.""
Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence, for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"".
Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have come here.
With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights here from Moscow. The two countries have long-standing ties. Armenia is Russia's strategic ally in the South Caucasus region and hosts a Russian military base as well as being part of the Russian-led security alliance CSTO.
Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them.
After his detention, strange, anti-government messages appeared on Yura's phone as the couple were preparing to board their flight to the capital, Yerevan.
Yura was well aware that Russia's FSB security service had been ordering people to unlock their phones to reveal personal messages and contacts. He feared the messages may have been an attempt to incriminate him, but he made it through security without being stopped.
As the guests brought out tables and erected gazebos, the bride's mother, Valeriya Kiselyova, revealed that back in Russia her husband had stopped a car with the letter Z emblazoned on its windscreen - one of the propaganda symbols of the invasion.
""He took out a shovel and ordered them to rip it off. I realised then that we had to leave to avoid being imprisoned,"" she said.
Wedding guest Polina Prokofyeva described spending 12 days in a prison cell for taking part in an anti-war rally in St Petersburg.
""The whole process was so humiliating, they try to make you feel that you are nobody and your voice means nothing,"" she said. After a three-minute court hearing, she said she was convicted of taking part in resisting Russia's so-called special military operation.
Many Russian emigres here are IT specialists who see Armenia as a practical place to resettle.
The arrival of tens of thousands of highly skilled Russian citizens will have a positive impact on Armenia's economy, says Haykaz Fanyan of the Armenian Centre for Socioeconomic Studies.
""In March, Armenia's accommodation and food services sector recorded growth of 230% and 30% compared with the same period last year. Relocated Russians established 1,500 enterprises, of which 300 are companies and the rest are private entrepreneurs.""
Among them was Dima, a 34-year Muscovite, who has just opened a cafe serving Israeli and Korean food. ""At the beginning of March the centre of Yerevan looked like the centre of Moscow, there were so many Russians,"" he said. ""They looked lost and didn't know what to do.""
He had been considering leaving Russia even before the war.
""We've been losing our freedom for some time, now it's dangerous for me to go back because two years ago I posted some anti-government message on Facebook, I could be jailed for it now.""
Sitting at his cafe were a young couple.
""I served in a regular army for a year, and now I'd have to serve again as there was mobilisation,"" says video games developer Sergei. ""I didn't want to be jailed for avoiding military service, but I also did not want to kill innocent people, so I decided to leave.""
He is ashamed of once voting for Vladimir Putin while serving in the army in return for more food: ""I sold my country for two gingerbread cookies.""
His partner Anya, an English tutor, dropped out of her third year at university when her head of department declared that Ukrainians deserved what Russia was inflicting on them.
""It opened my eyes, I could not believe it that those responsible for teaching could say such things, that it was right to kill someone and that it was not right to say anything against it.""
Russian state TV has not just spread propaganda and disinformation about the war in Ukraine, it has also reported on riots in Armenia that never happened.
Anya said she had to reassure her mother that recent anti-government protests had been largely peaceful: ""I checked the reports she was talking about and found out that Russian TV used footage from riots in France.""
Opposition protesters set up a tent city, demanding Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's resignation over territory lost to neighbouring Azerbaijan during a 2020 war.
Here too, Kremlin disinformation has found a ready audience, as most Armenians speak Russian.
""We are for Russia, the Russians are our brothers,"" said one female protester. Others gathered around, voicing their support.
Vardan Makhitaryan picks up the conversation: ""We don't want this democracy that destroyed the strong Armenian army, and Russia does not want it either. Why is the whole world looking at Russia with wolf eyes? Russia did not attack Ukraine, it is just defending itself.""
Sentiments like these may be of concern for recent Russian arrivals who oppose the war against Ukraine, and Polina Prokofyeva fears Armenia may not be the safe haven that dissidents need.
She points out that some hotels have been asked by police to hand over data of their Russian guests. ""Just talking to people in Yerevan, I feel they don't really get what's going on and they're on the side of my government which punished me and all my friends,"" she said.
But Valeriya, mother of the bride, said she had nothing but gratitude for the welcome she had so far received. ""Since leaving Russia, I've seen so much beauty. Had it not been for the war I would have died from happiness.""Preparations were under way for a pop-up Russian wedding in the courtyard of a disused textile factory in the remote Armenian town of Tumanyan. Most of the guests were artists and musicians who had fled Russia.
Bride and groom Yura Boguslavsky and Asya Kiselyova, both animation artists from Moscow, moved here to escape Russia's crackdown on anti-war protesters.
""We got arrested together - Asya, our friends and even her parents,"" said the bridegroom. ""Everyone has relatives and friends in Ukraine. It's crazy, and it's not us who should have been arrested.""
Challenging Russia's war has become a criminal offence, for anyone deemed to have spread ""fake news"".
Since the invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens have come here.
With European destinations closed to Russian airlines, there are few options left. Armenia requires no entry visas and there are regular flights here from Moscow. The two countries have long-standing ties. Armenia is Russia's strategic ally in the South Caucasus region and hosts a Russian military base as well as being part of the Russian-led security alliance CSTO.
Russians have also moved to Georgia or Turkey, or other destinations that will take them.
After his detention, strange, anti-government messages appeared on Yura's phone as the couple were preparing to board their flight to the capital, Yerevan.
Yura was well aware that Russia's FSB security service had been ordering people to unlock their phones to reveal personal messages and contacts. He feared the messages may have been an attempt to incriminate him, but he made it through security without being stopped.
As the guests brought out tables and erected gazebos, the bride's mother, Valeriya Kiselyova, revealed that back in Russia her husband had stopped a car with the letter Z emblazoned on its windscreen - one of the propaganda symbols of the invasion.
""He took out a shovel and ordered them to rip it off. I realised then that we had to leave to avoid being imprisoned,"" she said.
Wedding guest Polina Prokofyeva described spending 12 days in a prison cell for taking part in an anti-war rally in St Petersburg.
""The whole process was so humiliating, they try to make you feel that you are nobody and your voice means nothing,"" she said. After a three-minute court hearing, she said she was convicted of taking part in resisting Russia's so-called special military operation.
Many Russian emigres here are IT specialists who see Armenia as a practical place to resettle.
The arrival of tens of thousands of highly skilled Russian citizens will have a positive impact on Armenia's economy, says Haykaz Fanyan of the Armenian Centre for Socioeconomic Studies.
""In March, Armenia's accommodation and food services sector recorded growth of 230% and 30% compared with the same period last year. Relocated Russians established 1,500 enterprises, of which 300 are companies and the rest are private entrepreneurs.""
Among them was Dima, a 34-year Muscovite, who has just opened a cafe serving Israeli and Korean food. ""At the beginning of March the centre of Yerevan looked like the centre of Moscow, there were so many Russians,"" he said. ""They looked lost and didn't know what to do.""

Ukrainian troops could withdraw from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces are close to surrounding, an official there says.
Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russians were in part of the city. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave.""
Russia has made seizing the whole eastern Donbas region a key war aim.
Ukraine is pleading for long-range weaponry to resist Russia's advance, but the US has so far not offered it.
On Friday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Ukraine needed long-range multiple-launch rocket systems.
""I'm afraid that Putin, at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas,"" he told Bloomberg.
""He's continuing to make gradual, slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily.""
In Severodonetsk Mr Haidai said more than half the housing had been destroyed and almost all buildings there had been damaged. All remaining residents were in shelters.
The road out of the city to Ukraine-held territory was under constant fire but still passable, he added.
Also on Friday, pro-Russian forces seized the town of Lyman to the west of Severodonetsk, setting the scene for an advance towards the major cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.
By BBC Digital Europe Editor Paul Kirby
Seizing Lyman represents a significant moment in the slow advance of Russia's proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. The battle for the city has been intense, even if Ukrainian forces started pulling back from it earlier this week. It's the second major success for Russia this week, following the fall of Svitlodarsk further south.
Lyman is not a big city in itself, but it gives Russia's proxies control of a key east-west road. It also means they are now within 20km (12 miles) of the city of Slovyansk, to the south-west. Slovyansk is a major transport and supply hub for Ukraine, even though the trains stopped running there weeks ago.
The other big battle is further to the east, where Russian forces are targeting the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. These are important cities in Ukraine's industrial heartland known as Donbas and losing them would be a significant blow for the army.
Away from the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks during a call with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.
According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin also denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports was to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause was sanctions imposed by the US and the EU.
The UN has warned that Russia's invasion could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years. It has reduced global supplies of cereals such as maize and wheat as well as cooking oil and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN.
Meanwhile the Moscow branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church says it is cutting ties with Russia because of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch's support for the war.
""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow... on the war,"" the Church said in a statement. It also declared the ""full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.""
Ukraine is highly significant for Russia's Orthodox Church and is home to many important monasteries. Part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had already broken away from Moscow in 2019.Ukrainian troops could withdraw from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces are close to surrounding, an official there says.

News presenter and correspondent Zhanna Agalakova was one of the most famous faces on Russian state television until March, when she quit her job over the war in Ukraine.
Agalakova, who is now in hiding, tells the BBC's Newsnight that Russian TV is a ""brainwashing machine"" and she wishes people would switch it off.

The war in Ukraine has highlighted how countries need to put values before profits, Nato's chief has warned.
Jens Stoltenberg said it had shown ""how economic relations with authoritarian regimes can create vulnerabilities"".
His speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos singled out trade with Russia and China in particular.
Mr Stoltenberg pointed to issues such as Russia's dominance over Europe's gas supply, as well as bids from Chinese companies to run 5G networks.
""International trade has undoubtedly brought great prosperity but we must recognise that our economic choices have consequences for our security,"" the former Norwegian prime minister told people gathered at the event.
""Freedom is more important than free trade. The protection of our values is more important than profit.""
He said the fact European countries could buy as much gas as they wanted from Moscow was ""wrong"" and ""dangerous"".
""It provides Russia with a tool to intimidate and to use against us, and that has been clearly demonstrated now, I regret to say.""
Europe has been accused of helping fund Moscow's war in Ukraine through its payment for energy, and is currently taking steps to reduce its reliance on Russian gas imports by two thirds by the end of 2022.
Meanwhile, Russia has cut off gas and electricity supplies to Finland since it announced its ambition to join Nato. Poland and Bulgaria have also seen their gas supplies cut off after refusing to pay in Russian roubles.
Mr Stoltenberg also noted that new 5G networks were part of countries' ""critical infrastructure"" and control of the networks was ""of vital security importance"".
""We cannot say that in the interest of profits and free trade we just open up those networks also for suppliers that actually are not reliable when it comes to our security,"" he said.
Fears have been raised in recent years over Chinese companies' involvement in telecoms networks.
The UK, US, Australia and New Zealand have already placed bans on China's biggest telecoms equipment makers getting involved in 5G networks.
Canada is the latest country to announce a ban, saying last week it would help ""protect the safety and security of Canadians"".
The companies have said the move is purely political. Mr Stoltenberg said he was not arguing against trade with China.The war in Ukraine has highlighted how countries need to put values before profits, Nato's chief has warned.

Boris Johnson has called for more military support for Ukraine, as it battles Russian forces in the east of the country.
The prime minister said Russian troops are ""continuing to chew through ground"" in the Donbas region, making ""slow, but I'm afraid palpable, progress.""
Thousands of frontline Ukrainian troops are now using weapons and other equipment supplied by the UK.
The government says it is spending £1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine.
So what exactly is being sent, and how much of a difference is it making?
The UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine.
Nlaws are designed to destroy tanks at short range with a single shot.
Crucially for Ukraine's armed forces who need weapons immediately, the missiles are easy to transport and simple to use. A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day.
Many analysts believe they have already had a major impact on the course of the conflict.
""Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,"" says Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute.
The weapons have been ""particularly effective"" when used in combination with artillery, he says.
He points to successful strikes on tank columns, where Nlaws have destroyed the front vehicles, trapping those to the rear for targeting with artillery.
Defence Minister James Heappey confirmed that ""hundreds"" of Brimstone missiles would be sent to Ukraine on 28 April.
Brimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.
The missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.
Launching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.
If used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.
""It all depends where you hit,"" he says. ""If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.""
Britain has donated 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.
Mastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.
Analysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.
It is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively, often to force enemy vehicles into areas where they can be targeted with anti-tank weaponry.
The Ministry of Defence says it is supplying ""dozens"" of heavy lift unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces.
Analysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the ""last mile"" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement.
While Russia has so far failed to encircle large numbers of Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine, the threat of artillery fire in some areas is ever-present.
""It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,"" says Mr Bronk. ""Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger.""
Britain says it has donated five air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.
Starstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.
It ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.
""From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,"" says Mr Bronk. ""There's very little you can do about it.""
He says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.
However,  Starstreak requires much more training than systems such as Nlaw, and is no substitute, say analysts, for longer-range air defence systems.
Britain is also supplying a ""small number"" of tracked Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.
Sustaining supplies of Western equipment, weapons and ammunition will be extremely important to the Ukrainians in the longer term, according to retired Brig Ben Barry, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
He says that although Ukraine has some weapons manufacturing capacity of its own, it will be difficult for its troops to take significant territory back from Russian forces without substantial outside support.
Military professionals point out that Ukraine's need is largely for equipment which its troops already know how to use, or can be trained on very quickly.
Much of Ukraine's weaponry was designed and manufactured in former Warsaw Pact eastern European countries.
For this reason, the UK has offered to send British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill its donations of T-72 tanks to Ukraine.
Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew.
In the days shortly before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, UK ministers insisted that supplies to Ukraine would be confined to ""defensive"" weapons.
That means weapons which can only be used to defend Ukraine from attack, and not to attack Russia.
The government has signalled that it is moving away from purely defensive supplies, but some experts question the whole distinction.
""There is no such thing as a purely defensive weapon,"" says Brig Barry. ""Defensive weapons are also offensive, because they can defend equipment being used to mount an attack.""
Other equipment supplied by the UK includes:

A court in Ukraine has jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the conflict began.
Ukraine says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes, However, the Russian government denies it has been targeting civilians.
The International Criminal Court has also sent a team of investigators and forensics experts to the country.
It may not seem like it, but ""even war has rules"", as the International Committee of the Red Cross puts it.
These are contained in treaties called the Geneva Conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements.
Civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival.
Some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons.
The sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers, who have rights as prisoners of war.
Serious offences such as murder, rape or mass persecution of a group are known as ""crimes against humanity"" or, in some circumstances, ""genocide"".
The 21-year-old Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin admitted shooting 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the head, a few days after the invasion began.
Sentencing Shishimarin, the judge said he had committed ""a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order"" and that only a life sentence was appropriate.
Ukraine is preparing cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offences including killing civilians, rape, bombing civilian infrastructure and looting.
US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both accused Russia of carrying out war crimes in Ukraine.
Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, and other nearby areas.
Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.
In March, a Russian strike on a theatre in Mariupol appeared to be the first confirmed location of a mass killing. The word ""children"" was written in giant letters outside the building.
Ukraine previously called Russia's air strike on Mariupol's hospital a war crime.
Many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of ""aggressive warfare"".
There have been a series of one-off courts since World War Two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia.
A body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Today, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) both have roles upholding the rules of war.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rules on disputes between states, but cannot prosecute individuals. Ukraine has begun a case against Russia.
If the ICJ ruled against Russia, the UN Security Council (UNSC) would be responsible for enforcing that.
But Russia - one of council's five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states.
It's the permanent modern successor to Nuremberg, which prosecuted key Nazi leaders in 1945.
Nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up special courts to uphold international law.
The ICC's chief prosecutor, British lawyer Karim Khan QC, believes there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in Ukraine.
Investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013, before Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
If there's evidence, the prosecutor will ask ICC judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in The Hague.
However the court doesn't have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects - and since Russia is not a member of the court it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.
It's far easier to pin a war crime on the soldier who commits it, than the leader who ordered it.
Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch - an organisation with expertise in gathering evidence of war crimes in conflicts - agrees there is evidence of summary executions and other grave abuses by Russian forces.
He says establishing the ""chain of command"" is very important for any future trials - including whether a leader authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it.
The ICC can also prosecute the offence of ""waging aggressive war"". This is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict, beyond justifiable military action in self-defence.
It originated at Nuremberg, after the judge sent by Moscow convinced the Allies that Nazi leaders should face justice for ""crimes against peace"".
However, Professor Philippe Sands QC, an expert on international law at University College London, says the ICC couldn't prosecute Russia's leaders for this because the country isn't a signatory to the court.
In theory, the UN Security Council could ask the ICC to investigate this offence. But again, Russia could veto this.

A British man who fled Kyiv with his family says his Ukrainian wife is in distress because her therapy dog has been stuck in quarantine for weeks.
Mike Haley, 61, fled the war-torn country with his wife Alla, 51, and her 81-year-old mother Valentyna.
They travelled more than 2,000 miles with Pomeranian Archie, who helps Mrs Haley manage panic attacks.
But the couple, now in Newcastle, said red tape over vaccination issues meant the dog could not join them.
Mr Haley, originally from Jarrow, had been working as an English teacher and translator when the war started in February.
The family sheltered in the corridor of their apartment for eight days - during which time Mr Haley was kicked down a flight of a stairs and his friend was shot - before they got a train out of Kyiv.
After travelling via Poland to Amsterdam they sailed to North Shields with Archie, who they said helped keep their spirits up by giving them ""something else to focus on"".
But on arriving in the UK, the dog was held by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, they said.
Officials said although he had been microchipped and vaccinated there was a technical problem with his rabies inoculation, which happened before he was chipped, the couple said.
The body, overseen by Defra, ensures animals coming in to the UK are rabies-free and Archie was given a second inoculation after he arrived.
The Haleys said they were worried about whether having two doses close together would be safe because Archie is a small dog.
They said he had so far been held - 240 miles away in Aberdeen - for seven weeks and they were having difficulty finding out what is going on.
Mr Haley said the uncertainty was ""like torture"" for his wife and was making her sick.
""We came 2,000 miles with him,"" he said.
""He was given a clean bill of health in Holland and checked over - we'd made sure he'd had all his vaccinations.
""This little dog gave positive emotions to everybody, and then he was just taken away when we arrived.
""This is torment.""
A Defra spokesman said they could not discuss individual cases but said: ""We have increased resources and streamlined processes to ensure those fleeing Ukraine and entering the UK are not delayed by bringing their pets.
""We have introduced a new rapid rabies blood test to cut quarantine times and lower-risk animals are being moved into isolation.""

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61575387;2022-05-26;Ukraine war: World Bank boss warns over global recession;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
The head of the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as the price of food, energy and fertiliser jump.
David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"".
He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown.
His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract.
""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast.
""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added.
Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%.
GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of economic growth. It is one of the most important ways of measuring how well, or badly, an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces.
Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates.
Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas.
That's even as Western nations push ahead with plans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.
He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region.
He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.
Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said.
Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"".
""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said.
""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added.
Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns.
""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopened… the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time.""
Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai.
The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country.
In recent weeks, official figures have shown that large parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of economic growth. It is one of the most important ways of measuring how well, or badly, an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces.
Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates.
Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas.
That's even as Western nations push ahead with plans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.
He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region.
He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.
Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said.
Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"".
""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said.
""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added.
Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns.
""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopened… the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time.""
Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai.
The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country.
In recent weeks, official figures have shown that large parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided.
It's the first visit from a senior royal to the region since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The latest figures show almost a million Ukrainians have already crossed the border into Romania.
Prince Charles visited a centre near Bucharest, which supports a rising number of refugees.
""It's a nightmare situation,"" the prince said to Ukrainian families who were collecting supplies of food and clothing.
He said to ""keep praying"" and told them he was ""full of admiration for the Ukrainian people - their extraordinary courage and resilience"".
Aid workers explained the scale of the pressures.
More than six million people have left Ukraine in the three months of the war. In the past week alone, a further 40,000 people are estimated to have crossed into Romania.
Prince Charles has been strongly outspoken about the war, attacking the ""brutal aggression"" inflicted on Ukraine. Having travelled to Bucharest, about 150 miles from the Ukraine border - this is also the closest a senior British royal has come to the conflict.
The prince also has a long-standing connection with Romania, having set up a charitable foundation in the country and restored a traditional farmhouse.
The visit comes as figures from the UNHCR show 966,000 Ukrainians have entered Romania since the start of the war, with only Poland taking in more refugees.
""I've not seen anything so big and so fast. By any measure it's a major movement of people,"" says Mike Weickert, global rapid response director for World Vision, a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees in Romania.
""It's going to be increasingly difficult for refugees and for the hosting countries,"" said Mr Weickert, whose aid agency is working in the Romexpo centre, visited by Prince Charles and Margareta, head of Romania's royal family.
The conference centre site is helping more than 1,000 people a day, with Romanian authorities and international agencies providing food, clothing and advice services.
Among those helping with the international effort at the centre is Stephen Noble of the Salvation Army.
He spent the pandemic helping with a food bank in Scarborough, and there are some similarities to the services being offered here, with food parcels available and racks of second-hand clothing.
There are soft toys for children and pet food for the dogs and cats that some families brought with them.
Mr Noble has been struck by the dignity of those arriving, who had to leave everything behind - and says that for those in the UK who have made donations it is ""absolutely worthwhile"".
He says one of the most practical ways of supporting refugees has been to give them vouchers, worth about £10, to use in local supermarkets, which allows them to buy for their individual needs.
One of the translators is herself a refugee. Lisa has gone from being a sales manager in Odessa to helping disorientated new arrivals.
""At first it's a shock. You don't believe it. Then you realise you have to stay."" So many people have left Ukraine that in some villages there is only one person left, she says.
For those refugees continuing to stream across the border into Romania, by car, bus or train, there is still a generous reception.
At Bucharest's Gara de Nord train station there are volunteers and support workers waiting to help families escaping the war.
Romania has given Ukrainian refugees free travel on its railways, with women and children the great majority of new arrivals. On the station concourse there are tents ready to provide immediate shelter and first aid.
This is a refugee crisis in a highly-mobile, urban setting.
Many are moving on to other countries, some will try to return to Ukraine, and those that stay in Romania are mostly in the bigger cities, with spaces having to be found in hostels, private houses, public buildings or hotel rooms.
As well as emergency needs, such as food and shelter, aid workers say they will need to provide longer-term support for refugees.
Children will need schools, adults will need jobs to have an income, older people with health problems will need access to medical support and there will be mental health problems from such a traumatic uprooting.
The longer refugees are out of their homes the more they risk ""running out money, running out of options"", says Mr Weickert.The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided.

When their dogs started digging insistently at a spot in the woods, villagers in Zavalivka called in the authorities.
A Ukrainian military team were soon at the scene in white protective suits, carefully removing the topsoil.
They uncovered a man's body, face down with his legs oddly twisted beneath him. It was clear from his uniform that he was a Russian soldier.
Weeks after they failed to seize Ukraine's capital, the remains of Russian troops are still being discovered in and around the villages they passed through or occupied near the capital, Kyiv. But Ukraine says Russia shows little interest in getting them back.
From the grave in the woods, the body was removed to a refrigerated train on the outskirts of Kyiv that now operates as a mobile morgue for the Russian dead.
The white plastic sacks are marked with numbers rather than names and there were at least 137 stacked inside two carriages on the day we visited.
The Ukrainians attempt to identify the dead: on the body just brought in, the forensics team turned up two bank cards, as well as badges for a Russian motorised rifle brigade.
""At least this one has a chance of getting home,"" the man in charge announced, displaying the finds, including a soiled fragment of T-shirt printed with the Army of Russia logo.
Moments later, I confirmed that the man I had just seen exhumed had been a young, married soldier from Siberia. Next to his body bag, a carefully posed black-and-white photograph from his social media profile stared out from my phone.
Russia has a proud slogan: ""We don't abandon our own."" It's a big part of President Vladimir Putin's supposed justification for invading Ukraine, where he falsely claimed Russian-speakers needed protection.
That pledge appears not to apply so much to Russia's own soldiers.
""The bodies we've found show they treat people as rubbish, as cannon fodder,"" Col Volodymyr Liamzin told the BBC. ""They don't need their soldiers. They throw them here, retreat - and leave the bodies.""
We don't actually know how the young soldier in the woods came to be abandoned. The villagers in Zavalivka say they were mostly hiding in their cellars from shelling at the time - they assume he was injured and got lost as his unit was forced to retreat.
From what we've learned of the Russian troops fighting around Kyiv, many were young and inexperienced. It's likely they were fleeing under fire.
""We did do one swap,"" Col Liamzin says, explaining that the Russian side provided a shortlist of the dead soldiers it wanted returned.
""We're ready to give them all back, we want our own dead returned too. We knock on every door there is, but there is no response, no dialogue,"" the colonel says.
The delay in collecting bodies isn't unique to Russia.
Neither side in this war is open about the number of casualties suffered. We've spoken to several Ukrainian families who say their own government has been less than helpful in recovering the remains of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield.
One woman, who was told of her husband's death by the men in his unit, said she had been trying to recover his body for almost three months.
But the Russian dead are being discovered here all the time.
Just up the road from Zavalivka in Sytnyaky, the village elder told us at least 10 Russian soldiers were killed and left behind in March, probably more.
Their column was ambushed after they lost their way: the locals had removed and switched the traffic signs.
The battle was fierce. What was once a roadside restaurant at the spot is now a heap of rubble, a bit of wall and a giant aquarium that somehow survived the assault.
Leaflets in the ruins call on Russian soldiers to surrender and save their lives, and spare the blood of Ukrainian children.
The village elder says he and others buried the Russians after the battle ""for sanitary reasons"". When I look quizzical, he says most were blown to pieces.
He wasn't allowed to show us the graves: they constitute a crime scene until Col Liamzin's team can get round to visiting and exhuming the site. But his dig-list is already long.
A local man planting beetroot confirms that the Russians were killed along the main road.
""It's not humane to abandon a soldier, not to bury them,"" Mikola says, leaning on his spade. His own son is in Ukraine's army.
""My wife felt sorry for the Russians at first, but then we found out what they did here,"" he adds, referring to the shooting of unarmed civilians in places like Bucha and Irpin.
""No-one feels sorry for the Russians after that.""
The burned wrecks of Russian tanks still line all the main roads into Kyiv. Every few seconds, cars stop and families spill out to take photographs, children clambering over the top.
It seems somehow cathartic. The other day, I watched a man working out by lifting a tank barrel up and down, over his head, as though he was doing weights.
But that same day, just a few steps across the road, we spotted human remains on a scorched patch of verge - a charred piece of spine and a fragment of foot - and a sweet, deathly smell when the wind dropped. It was most likely one of the men killed in one of the nearby tanks.
So the refrigerated train in Kyiv is still filling up, and there are more in other cities close to the fighting. For the Ukrainian military who recover and store the bodies, there is little sympathy: the dead are enemy soldiers - invaders.
But in Russia, someone, somewhere must be looking for each one of them.

Imagine being a coal miner, descending into a deep, ageing, rickety mineshaft.
Then imagine doing that in a war zone.
""It's scary, but what can you do? We don't have many other options,"" said Ukrainian nurse Ira Yusko, 30, smiling grimly, as she switched on her headlamp at the Toretsk coal mine in the eastern Donbas region.
Around her, more than a dozen miners - their faces already smeared with grime - shuffled forwards in the dark towards a rattling iron elevator that stood waiting to take the group 800 metres underground for a six-hour shift.
""We try to be positive. But it's hard on the soul. Depressing. These are terrible times. It's sad at home too - my wife is gone,"" said Vitaly Vahorder. He's spent half his life working at the Toretsk mine. His family recently joined the exodus heading west to safer locations.
Outside, the occasional boom and crunch of artillery fire echoed across the wheat fields from the front lines 4km to the east and south, where Russian troops are struggling to gain ground against fierce Ukrainian resistance in Donbas.
""People go down the mine knowing they may not come back up. And when you do come back up, anything can happen - the town is constantly being bombed,"" said Anatoly Sholokhov, deputy head of Toretsk's coal miners' association, as he watched the elevator door slide shut. The 69-year-old miner was born in the town and was once its mayor.
The coal mines, their steep-sided slag heaps dotting the horizon like dark pyramids, have been a defining feature of eastern Ukraine for well over a century. They provided the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Union, with much of its raw energy. But the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the past eight years of separatist conflict with pro-Russian militias, and the Kremlin's new offensive have combined to force most of the mines to close.
One of many concerns today is that the latest mine closures are happening abruptly, and without proper safety measures, causing old shafts to flood with highly toxic water that threatens to poison local rivers.
""The danger comes when you stop several mines at once,"" said Anatoly. ""You can't control where the ground water goes. It would be a disaster if it comes to the surface. This whole area would become uninhabitable. So, an ecological crisis looms over our town. May God prevent these mines from stopping. If the work stops and water begins to flood the mines, it could cause a catastrophe,""
Only two mines are still working here in Toretsk - formerly called Dzerzhynsk in honour of the founder of the Communist secret police.
Driving in from the west, past Ukrainian army checkpoints and roadblocks and into the near-empty town with its Soviet-era architecture and monuments, is like stepping back into the past. A Soviet red star still clings to the top of one of the oldest towers at the Toretsk mine, which first began producing coal in the 1930s, and was badly damaged during World War Two. The mine appears to have experienced few improvements, or even licks of paint, since it was refurbished in 1955.
One sunny morning last week, staff showed visitors around the site. Giant pieces of rusting machinery sat beside doodle-like swirls of rail track, where a lone female worker was busy pushing mine carts into a wooden shed by hand. Two giant slag heaps behind the mine were partially covered with trees and undergrowth. A huge tree grew through one ancient winding wheel. Overhead, floorboards creaked ominously as staff walked along a footbridge from the shaft back to the communal shower block - currently without water, like the rest of the town, due to blockages on a nearby canal which locals blamed on the war.
""There's no water anywhere in this town. You go to the toilet - but how do you flush? When it rains, everyone in our apartment block goes out to collect rainwater,"" said Vitaly.
Only a third of the mine's staff have stayed on in the town since the Russian offensive began earlier this year - some out of loyalty to the mine itself, but mostly for financial reasons.
""I've been working here for twenty years. I went straight to the mines after school. We don't have any other professions here. No factories. We earn 8,000 to 10,000 hryvnias a month (£220 - £275, $275 - $343) and with the current prices that's nothing, tiny, no better than a student's stipend,"" said Yuri Podlutsky.
As a group, the miners appeared reluctant to pass judgement on the war or President Putin directly. Many of them are Russian-speaking and appeared keen to avoid territory that could cause frictions within a tight-knit community. But several men acknowledged a strong nostalgia for the Soviet era and the times when Ukrainians and Russians worked side by side in the mines.
""Whether you want Putin or not, we still need to live and work. There are a lot of 'Soviets' here,"" said Vitaly. ""I consider myself simply a local. Some of us speak Russian as our first language. But we all share the same sky.""Imagine being a coal miner, descending into a deep, ageing, rickety mineshaft.

He was trying to commute to Barry for work experience when he was stopped in Swansea.
He was wrongly barred from using a free travel pass for migrants because he is not Ukrainian, and said railway station staff accused him of “abusing” the system.

The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion.
It could be fighting a losing battle in Luhansk, the northern part of Donbas region.
The Ukrainian General Staff says the Russians appear to be concentrating their forces for another push.
In the last day the Russians have intensified their attacks across the Donbas front line - getting closer to completing the encirclement of Severodonetsk, a city of 80,000 before the invasion.
The Ukrainians, as usual, are fighting with stubborn determination. Reinforcements are being poured into the battle.
In just a few minutes I saw about 20 armoured personnel carriers, with soldiers riding on them, driving to the front line - along with tanks on transporters and multiple rocket launchers.
They have slowed the Russians down but have not stopped the offensive grinding forward. The Russians are inflicting heavy casualties.
A military source in the 57th Brigade told me that one of their units went into the line with 240 men and came out with about 140 - the rest of them killed, wounded and captured.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Russians could be killing up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers a day in Donbas.
Not far from Severodonetsk, Bakhmut is a town getting slowly eaten by the war. This week it is about three miles from the Russians, well within range. Next week it might be much closer.
Civilians with somewhere to go have left. In the ruins in Donbas, the victory in Kyiv in March - the euphoria, glory and sacrifice - feel distant.
Bakhmut has been heavily shelled. Standing in front of his damaged house, a man in his 40s called Mitri showed defiance, apprehension and frustration. He had no idea what to expect in his town.
""I'm not Nostradamus. Why did Putin attack? It's all political games.""
Mitri said President Zelensky's predecessor Petro Poroshenko would have reached a ceasefire agreement by now.
""At least there was peace before, they were negotiating. It's a pity about the people who died, the soldiers. It is a real shame.""
It was, he said, President Zelensky's fault. He had missed an opportunity.
Mitri shrugged and sucked angrily on his cigarette when I asked him if he would accept a deal that allowed Russia to control all of Donbas, compared to roughly a third of the territory it controlled before the invasion.
""I don't know. What could it change for me? The main thing is to stay alive. This is just the beginning, everything is still to come. If we survive, we'll see how it goes.""
Thousands of civilians are still in Severodonetsk, as the Russians fight to encircle the last Ukrainian soldiers in the oblast of Luhansk, the northern side of Donbas.
At the railway station in Pokrovsk, a safe distance from the battle, I spoke to Lida, an elderly woman who uses a wheelchair. She had just been evacuated from Severodonetsk.
With other disabled and wounded civilians, she was being evacuated to the relative safety of western Ukraine on a special train, turned into an ambulance and intensive care unit by the medical organisation MSF, Doctors without Borders.
Lida, who radiated defiance and cigarette smoke, was rescued by soldiers who took her and other civilians through heavily shelled areas.
""They bombed everything, we barely escaped. Glass is smashed, everything is scattered around. And I am not able to walk at all. Disabled. That's how it is.
""Nine storey buildings, the upper floors are destroyed. All ruined.
""Putin's a scoundrel. We used to live peacefully. There was a Soviet Union and so be it. They divided Ukraine and Russia. So that's why the problems began.""
If President Putin's forces can encircle Severodonetsk, their next targets would most likely be the key cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk in the Donetsk Oblast, the other side of Donbas.
Then he might declare victory in the battle for Donbas.
I saw lines of freshly dug trenches near the two cities, as the Ukrainians prepared fall back positions. If they fell, and it is no certainty as they are both heavily defended, President Putin would be able to declare his first significant victory of the war.
Russia would control a belt of territory stretching along its border south from Donbas and along most of Ukraine's coastline.
President Zelensky says that only diplomacy can end the war, but he has said that Russia must return to the positions it held before the invasion.
His allies, led by the US and UK, want to weaken Putin's Russia permanently. They have said Russia must not win.
Their critics say they'll fight to the last Ukrainian.
The currency of war is blood. As families bury their dead, more Ukrainians, like Mitri in Bakhmut, will question the blood price they are paying, and ask whether it is better to pay for a ceasefire with land - or lives.The Ukrainian army is under more pressure than at any time since the first desperate weeks after the Russian invasion.

Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"".
In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.
Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring.
It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports.
Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"".
His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"".
""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said.
Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis.
On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Minister urged the international community to create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country.
Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed.
A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume.
However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added.
Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures.
Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria.
And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year.
Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term.
He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices.
""We have to explain to the public opinion what are the consequences of the war,"" he said. ""Putin's main tool is intimidation, fear, illusions and propaganda.""
On the possibility of a trade war between the UK and EU, Mr Morawiecki said it would be ""lose-lose"".
""Only Putin and our enemies will be happy with yet another disagreement between such close partner partners as the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said.
He said there was room for compromise between Brussels and London and he was trying ""to calm down the situation between France and the United Kingdom as much as possible"".
When pushed about what would happen if the UK unilaterally breaks the deal, as is currently being planned for, the Polish PM replied: ""In the current circumstances in particular, where we have such a brutal invasion, it should be a wake up call for those who want to disagree on anything.
""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak.""
But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues.
Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war.
""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything.""
Mr Morawiecki added that, as with other wars, including the Second World War, ""we have to be prepared for a long war, unfortunately, and we have to make public opinion knowledgeable about what is going on in Ukraine"".Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The war has now become a ""global issue"" underscoring the importance of defending international order, he said.
Japanese PM Fumio Kishida echoed his comments, saying that a similar invasion should not happen in Asia.
Mr Biden was meeting the leaders of Japan, Australia and India in Tokyo in his first visit to Asia as president.
The four countries known collectively as the Quad discussed security and economic concerns including China's growing influence in the region - and differences over the Russian invasion.
Mr Biden's comments came a day after he warned China that it was ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan, and vowed to protect Taiwan militarily if China attacked, appearing to contradict a long-standing US policy on the issue.
It was later reported that Russian and Chinese warplanes had approached Japanese airspace as part of a joint military patrol, prompting Tokyo to announce it had scrambled jets in response.
Russian officials said the flight over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea was part of an annual military exercise.
Mr Kishida told a news conference that planning the exercise to coincide with today's summit was ""provocative"".
In his opening remarks at Tuesday's summit, Mr Biden said their meeting was about ""democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure that we deliver"".
The Ukraine war, he said, ""is going to affect all parts of the world"" as Russia's blockade of Ukraine grain exports aggravates a global food crisis.
Mr Biden promised the US would work with allies to lead the global response, reiterating their commitment to defend international order and sovereignty ""regardless of where they were violated in the world"" and remaining a ""strong and enduring partner"" in the Indo-Pacific region.
After their meeting, Mr Kishida told reporters that all four countries ""including India"" agreed on the importance of the rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity; and that ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force will never be tolerated"".
India is the only Quad member that has refused to directly criticise Russia for the invasion, and, in what appeared to be a concession to Delhi, there was no mention of Russia in the joint statement issued at the end of the talks.
There was also no direct reference to China or its activities, but the Quad nations announced a new maritime monitoring initiative that is expected to step up surveillance of Chinese activity in the region, along with a plan to spend at least $50bn (£40bn) on infrastructure projects and investment over the next five years.
Formally referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose grouping of countries following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that banded together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. The group fell dormant before it was resuscitated in 2017.
Since then however, the top leaders have gathered four times in less than two years, meeting once in Washington last September and twice virtually.
Analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given the grouping more impetus.
There has been mounting discomfort with China's growing assertiveness in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes between China and several countries, and a land boundary conflict with India.
Beijing's heavy investment in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia, while Japan has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy in its waters.
On Monday, Mr Biden unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led trade pact aiming to promote regional growth that includes 13 countries, mostly in Asia.
US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said it would provide countries ""an alternative to China's approach"". Officials said it would set standards in the areas of trade, supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and anti-corruption.
The IPEF has been widely seen as a way for the US to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific after former US President Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a regional trade pact - in 2017.The world is ""navigating a dark hour in our shared history"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden told key Asian allies.

About 300 islanders have expressed an interest in becoming sponsors.
Deputy Rob Prow, President of the Committee for Home Affairs, said it had taken a ""considerable amount of work"".
He added:  ""We absolutely needed to make sure that we could provide the necessary support to beneficiaries, some of whom may arrive with complex needs given the horrors they may have experienced.

People who put themselves forward as sponsors will be contacted, with a focus on those who can provide a self-contained unit of accommodation.
Ukrainian residents applying for the scheme will need to be matched to an approved sponsor prior to applying for a visa.
For the purposes of safeguarding, all individuals resident at a sponsors address may be subject to security checks as part of the visa application process, the States said.
The new policy covers eligibility for the scheme and the standards an individual will need to meet in order to become an approved sponsor.
It also details the visa application process and access to public services that Ukrainian beneficiaries can expect.

Russia's prominent jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny has lost an appeal against a nine-year prison term, but not before launching a scathing attack on the war in Ukraine.
Condemning Vladimir Putin's war as stupid, he said it was ""like your courts, built entirely on lies"".
Navalny was already serving a jail term when he was convicted in a fraud case rejected by supporters as fabricated.
He addressed the court in Moscow via a video link at his penal colony.
Long seen as a President Putin's most vocal critic in Russia, Navalny was detained the moment he flew home from Germany after treatment for a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Siberia in August 2020.
He was initially jailed for two and a half years for breaking bail conditions while being treated in hospital, but in March he was given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court.
The prosecutor told the court the verdict in March had been fair and justified but Navalny's defence lawyer argued it had contradicted international law. In comments that were repeatedly interrupted, Navalny said he despised the court and said the rulings against him were no different from the lies used by ""madman"" President Putin and state TV to justify the war.
""You will suffer a historic defeat in this stupid war that you started. It has no purpose or meaning. Why are we fighting a war?"" he said.
Russia has silenced criticism of its three-month war in Ukraine, prosecuting dozens of people who have refused to use the term ""special military operation"" and blocking independent media outlets.
During Tuesday's appeal hearing, Navalny told the court that the judge who gave him his initial jail term in February 2021, Natalya Repnikova, had later told his lawyers she regretted her decision. Repnikova died months later of coronavirus ""according to the official version"", he reportedly told the court.
Since Navalny was jailed last year he has been held in a jail at Pokrov, east of Moscow, but he now faces being transferred to a penal colony with a far stricter regime and very limited rights to prison visits. His colleagues say he is due to be moved to a facility in Melekhovo, where one former prisoner has made allegations of systematic torture.Russia's prominent jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny has lost an appeal against a nine-year prison term, but not before launching a scathing attack on the war in Ukraine.

A woman who moved from the UK to Poland to help Ukrainian refugees says she has been both inspired and devastated by what she has witnessed.
Lucie Shanks, 43, left her home in Whitley Bay in March to go and help in the wake of the Russian invasion.
The former support worker has since got to know many refugees and has been struck by their strength and resilience in the face of suffering.
""Anyone of them could be you or me,"" she told BBC Radio Newcastle.
Ms Shanks, who runs a candle business, said she felt moved to do something after reports of people fleeing Ukraine.

Lucie Shanks, 43, left her home in Whitley Bay in March to go and help in the wake of the Russian invasion.
The former support worker has since got to know many refugees and has been struck by their strength and resilience in the face of suffering.

A Russian diplomat has quit his post in disgust over the invasion of Ukraine - saying he had never been as ashamed of his country as he was the day the war started.
It is the highest-profile resignation over the war yet from a Moscow official, and came on the same day a Kyiv court found a Russian tank commander guilty of war crimes.
Meanwhile in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region Russian forces have been intensifying their attacks on the city of Severodonetsk.
Boris Bondarev walked away from his 20-year career in the Russian foreign service on Monday, publishing a scathing statement which criticised both the war and his former employer.
In the letter, the 41-year-old said the ""bloody, witless"" war had been ""unleashed by Putin"" and was designed to keep those behind it ""in power forever"" - whatever the cost.
Mr Bondarev is one of few to speak out in such a public way, and has been cheered on by people like Kira Yarmysh, the spokesperson for the jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.
But he told the BBC he did not think many of his colleagues would follow his lead. Instead, he said, many of them had welcomed the war.

Tank commander Sgt Vadim Shishimarin became the first Russian soldier to be convicted in Ukraine for a war crime relating to the invasion.
Shishimarin was jailed for life by a court in Kyiv which found he had shot dead a civilian in the early days of the invasion back in February.
The captured soldier admitted killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka but said he had been following orders.
In a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become a recurring accusation, the verdict sets a significant legal precedent.
Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred.
Since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the United Nations.
As the court delivered its verdict in Ukraine's capital, the country's east was coming under intensifying attacks from Russian forces.
The city of Severodonetsk, the largest one under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk province, was targeted by Russian artillery and missile fire.
Moscow is trying to capture the city and yesterday officials claim they repelled Russian forces trying to enter it from four different directions.
UK defence officials say capturing the city of 100,000 is one of Moscow's ""immediate tactical priorities.""
Lilia Yapparova is an independent Russian journalist who could face years in prison for covering the invasion as she sees it.
Right now she is reporting from Kyiv, but a return to Russia could mean criminal prosecution for failing to toe the official Kremlin line on the war.
""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford.
She risks joining the dozens of Russians who have already been prosecuted under Moscow's draconian ""fake news"" law.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61524376;2022-05-20;Ukraine says giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant can't supply Russia;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.
Russian troops are occupying the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant by the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine.
It is Europe's biggest nuclear plant. The Ukrainian staff are still operating it, but Russia has sent its own nuclear experts to monitor their work.
Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from it to Ukraine.
Marat Khusnullin said Russia would integrate the Zaporizhzhia plant with Russia's energy system if Kyiv refused to pay for the plant's electricity.
Visiting Russian-occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday he said ""if the Ukrainian energy system is ready to receive [electricity] and pay for it, then we'll work, but if not - then the plant will work for Russia"".
However a spokesman for Ukraine's state nuclear agency Energoatom said it would take years to link the plant to Russia.
""The plant only works in Ukraine's energy grid,"" Leonid Oliynyk told the BBC.
""The Russians can build a power line theoretically, but it will take a long time, like their Crimean bridge - several years,"" he said, referring to the bridge connecting Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to Russian territory.
""Now the power station is working at a minimum level, but Kyiv remains in charge, all the power lines are controlled by Ukraine. The Russian statement is wishful thinking,"" Mr Oliynyk added.
Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. But now just two of its six reactors are operating.
Ukrainian forces still control the city of Zaporizhzhia, on the opposite bank of the Dnieper. The nuclear power plant is in Enerhodar, a town of nearly 53,000 built in Soviet times to house the nuclear workers.
There have been several protest rallies in Enerhodar against the Russian occupation, violently broken up by Russian security forces with tear gas and stun grenades.
During his visit Mr Khusnullin said ""I think this region's future is to work in our friendly Russian family"".
On 3 March Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant, and later took control of it. Buildings around one of its reactors were damaged, according to Energoatom.
The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said radiation levels and reactor safety were not affected.
World leaders condemned Russia for the attack and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"".
The IAEA says the situation at the plant now remains ""fragile"" and ""unsustainable"", as Russian troops keep the staff under tight surveillance, along with a team of experts from Rosatom - Russia's state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it is trying to negotiate an inspection visit to the site.
Mr Oliynyk said ""the staff feel bad, because there's a lot of technical pressure on them, the Russians are behaving as occupiers"". He said Russia was keeping about 500 troops and 50 armoured vehicles at the site. ""They're checking documents, they don't let people speak freely and break up meetings in Enerhodar.""
He insisted that Ukraine ""will liberate the whole territory - no deals with the occupiers"".
Russia's temporary occupation of Chernobyl in northern Ukraine - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 - also alarmed world leaders.
The radiation level at the decommissioned plant is reported to be stable and within safe limits, but there are hotspots in places nearby where Russian soldiers dug trenches.
There have been some forest fires in the exclusion zone around the plant - not directly threatening it, Mr Oliynyk said. But he added: ""Firefighters cannot go there as so many mines were laid, it's too dangerous.""
After Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region, he said, Ukraine stockpiled nuclear fuel, so now it has enough to last two years.
Ukraine now has a deal with US power company Westinghouse to provide nuclear fuel, with the goal of replacing the 40% of nuclear fuel that Kyiv still gets from Moscow.Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61525477;2022-05-24;Ukraine war: Melitopol residents resist Russian occupation;"Russian forces met fierce resistance from residents when they arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol in February.
Locals tried to block armoured vehicles as the convoy of soldiers rolled in to occupy the city, and people flooded the streets waving Ukrainian flags.
When the Russians started cracking down on the protesters, the resistance movement was forced to evolve and new groups emerged.
Melitopol, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, is an area where partisan warfare has been active since at least the middle of March.
Ukraine's Military Intelligence Directorate has reported that from 20 March to 12 April ""partisans eliminated 70 Russian soldiers during their night patrol"".
These groups are continuing to carry out attacks.
Last Wednesday a Russian armoured train was reportedly derailed. Days earlier, two Russian soldiers were found dead in the street. Last month a bridge near Melitopol - used to deliver supplies to the Russian army - was blown up.
Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, says these attacks were organised by partisan groups. ""It's the job of our partisans, our secret services and our soldiers. They do this job together,"" he tells the BBC.
Mr Fedorov himself was abducted by Russian forces and later released as part of a prisoner exchange.
The Russians are desperately trying to crush all resistance. They are searching houses and detaining people, residents say, often at random.
On 29 April, armed men in military uniform with white armbands - the marking used by Russian soldiers - abducted Boris Kleshev, the head of a local fire brigade in Melitopol.
For two weeks his relatives heard nothing about his whereabouts. A few days ago, a pro-Russian Telegram channel posted a video showing Mr Kleshev and other Ukrainian men admitting that they were sharing information on Russian movements with the Ukrainian military.
Mr Kleshev was speaking with a low voice, clearly under duress. But even if it looked like a forced confession, those who made the video were unlikely to have cared - their aim is to break the resistance spreading through Melitopol.
These resistance groups, however, are only a small part of the movement.
""Ninety per cent of Melitopol residents are now partisans and they resist in their own way,"" says Svitlana Zalizetska, a local journalist.
""Some people just stare at the Russian soldiers with hatred. Others sing patriotic songs at night. Some people hang posters in the street with Ukrainian flags,"" she says, adding that some also pass on information about Russian military movements.
At the start of the invasion in February, Melitopol residents organised mass protests against the Russian army's presence. People regularly took to the streets with Ukrainian flags, chanting: ""Melitopol is Ukraine.""
""Russian forces were truly shocked to see that the local population was not happy to see them. Those soldiers really believed that they were liberators,"" says Iryna (not her real name), who lives in Melitopol.
A few weeks after the invasion, police from Rosgvardia - Russia's national guard - arrived to crack down on the protests. They started dispersing crowds and detaining activists.
But Russian troops appear to understand that defeating the resistance here requires more than just stopping the rallies.
Unlike other regions occupied by Russian forces, the military in Melitopol have been trying to win people's hearts and minds. ""We have the brand of 'polite people'"", Iryna jokes, referring to the term used to describe Russian soldiers when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.
""These are ordinary guys who look like us and try to be nice,"" she explains. ""They help elderly women and show that they care about people. But they can't realise that it was them who created all these troubles and that our people didn't beg for help before.""
In order to create a perception of normality, the Russian forces try to silence anyone who openly opposes them.
Svitlana Zalizetska, who used to run a popular news website, was pressured to co-operate with the new authorities appointed by the Russian military. She refused. When the mayor, Mr Fedorov, was abducted, Svitlana realised she could be next. She later escaped into territory controlled by Ukrainian forces.
Then, Russian officers started threatening her family. ""First they wanted to destroy the website. They failed,"" she says. ""Then they tried to capture me. They failed again. Then they detained my father and took him hostage to make me come back, and gain control over the website.""
Only when she publicly acknowledged that she no longer owned the website and stopped writing for it, they released her father.
The Russian army is mobilising resources to change the pro-Ukrainian views of the population in Melitopol. They desperately want to get schools, shops and businesses to reopen with the aim of presenting Russian rule as a positive step.
And the longer the occupation lasts, the harder it is for people to resist. Some residents, with no funds left to feed their families, are returning to work - even if it implies supporting the new Russian regime.
""If they are physically killing Ukrainians in Mariupol, here they're trying to break our souls,"" says Iryna. ""But they will fail.""Russian forces met fierce resistance from residents when they arrived in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol in February.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61548029;2022-05-23;Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports;"The international community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said.
Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed.
Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring.
It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports.
Ms Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's Minister of the Economy, urged the international community to help lift the blockade of the country's sea ports.
She said this could be a ""solution"" allowing Ukraine to export the grain currently stuck in its silos and unable to be shipped.
""We need the assistance of our international partners, to secure our exports through the sea ports... to find a way to build a corridor, or another solution, how to give an opportunity to Ukrainian vessels [to export via the Black Sea],"" she said. ""A safe passage.""
She hinted that military means might be necessary to achieve this.
""We need a guarantee from partners, of course it's a defence guarantee, a security guarantee, to be able to export [using] these vessels,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
""And to make it, not once but on a regular basis. That is most important.""
Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion.
As wheat prices soared on world commodity markets, the cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has gone up.
Ukraine is able to export small quantities of its commodities by river, rail and barges on the Danube river.
But Ms Svyrydenko warned those routes are insufficient.
""I think if you calculate it would take us five, six, seven years to export all these agricultural yields by these routes. So right now it's extremely important for us to unblock the seaports and we apply to our partners to do this,"" she said.
""The world needs it because Russia threatens the world with world hunger and the only way to solve this problem is to unblock the sea ports.
""If we don't give farmers the opportunity to export their goods, for them there won't be any sense in going to the next growing season,"" she continued.
Another item on the agenda, was how to make use of assets affected by international sanctions, Ms Svyrydenko said.
Ukraine made clear in March that it believed the assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and Russian central bank funds that have been frozen should be used to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine.
""We should take them and [use] them for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" she said. ""Otherwise what was the sense in freezing those assets, if no Ukrainian [would] receive them?""
""We just need to find a clear procedure for how to get these funds,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
Everything from railways stations to factories would need to be rebuilt, she said. Ukraine has estimated the amount of money needed to rebuild the country at around $600bn.
Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was examining how the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs could be used to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.The international community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said.

""I think if you calculate it would take us five, six, seven years to export all these agricultural yields by these routes. So right now it's extremely important for us to unblock the seaports and we apply to our partners to do this,"" she said.
""The world needs it because Russia threatens the world with world hunger and the only way to solve this problem is to unblock the sea ports.
""If we don't give farmers the opportunity to export their goods, for them there won't be any sense in going to the next growing season,"" she continued.
Another item on the agenda, was how to make use of assets affected by international sanctions, Ms Svyrydenko said.
Ukraine made clear in March that it believed the assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and Russian central bank funds that have been frozen should be used to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine.
""We should take them and [use] them for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" she said. ""Otherwise what was the sense in freezing those assets, if no Ukrainian [would] receive them?""
""We just need to find a clear procedure for how to get these funds,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
Everything from railways stations to factories would need to be rebuilt, she said. Ukraine has estimated the amount of money needed to rebuild the country at around $600bn.
Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was examining how the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs could be used to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war."

A same-sex couple who fled Ukraine have been welcomed into a home in Derbyshire after a woman and her wife offered to host LGBT refugees.
They were put in contact after a friend of the refugee couple read a BBC article.
One of the refugees, Tetiana, said living in the town of Belper was like being ""inside some English TV show"".
The BBC is not using photos of the couple as they were not openly in a relationship in Ukraine.
Sarah Barley-McMullen, who is hosting them with her wife Helen, said LGBT couples face more discrimination in Ukraine than they do in the UK.
""You are going against the family tradition and the Russian Orthodox Church,"" said Mrs Barley-McMullen, who is chair of Pride in Belper.
""You will then be accused of trying to destroy the culture and the identity of the country.
""It's so important that LGBT people from Ukraine are able to come to the UK and feel safe, often for the first time in their lives.""
Tetiana said she and her partner Yulia were struck by how beautiful their new home is.
""It's a very funny thing because our first and second and even third impression is we are in some movie, we are inside some English TV show, maybe Murder She Wrote, maybe Agatha Christie,"" she said.
""It's the setting for movies, for shows, because people cannot live in such a beautiful place. And very English, you know.""
But they still miss their own apartment, where they had lived for 10 years.
""Now I'm safe, I'm in a very wonderful place, I'm surrounded by wonderful people, but still, where is my home? Where is my former life? It's not here no more,"" said Tetiana.
Tetiana and Yulia had been temporarily living in Hungary and then Germany after fleeing their apartment in Ukraine.
Mrs Barley-McMullen said the visa process was more complicated because Yulia is Russian and the couple could not get married in Ukraine.
Same-sex marriage has been legal in the UK since 2014, but is not legal in Ukraine.
""There was a fear one of them couldn't get a visa, because they have no legal rights together as a couple,"" said Mrs Barley-McMullen.
""My wife and I had to write a letter to the visa office saying we would only accept them as an unmarried couple.""
They have now set up a group called OUT!Standing for Ukraine, for people in Derbyshire who want to support LGBT refugees.
One problem, Mrs Barley-McMullen said, is that the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme does not allow people to specify they would welcome LGBT refugees.
""You can specify whether you are happy to house some refugees with a pet but there isn't anything around sexuality or gender identity,"" she said.

A Russian diplomat has quit his job in protest at the ""bloody, witless"" war ""unleashed by Putin against Ukraine"".
Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor.
But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"".
Moscow has not yet commented.
Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"".
In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"".
""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote.
""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.""
The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy.
As resignation letters go, this one was scathing.
Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine.
""The aggressive war… the most serious crime… warmongering, lies and hatred…""
It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions.
Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.'
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so.""
Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"".
""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views.
""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said.
In contrast, Mr Bondarev said in his open letter he had ""never been so ashamed of my country"" as he was on 24 February, the day the invasion began.
It is unclear if he is the first diplomat to resign from the mission, although no one else has spoken out publicly.
Mr Bondarev is under no illusions that Moscow will now see him as a traitor, but notes he hasn't ""done anything illegal"".

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61549569;2022-05-23;Ukraine war: Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin jailed for life over war crime;"A court in Ukraine has jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the invasion.
Captured soldier Sgt Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka on 28 February.
He admitted shooting Mr Shelipov but said he had been acting on orders and asked forgiveness of the man's widow.
Many other alleged war crimes are being investigated by Ukraine.
And in a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become one of the defining features, Monday's outcome sets a significant legal precedent.
Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred.
Ukraine, however, is likely to bring more cases like this to unpick Moscow's blanket denials.
This sentencing is unlikely to lead to an immediate change in tactics from the invading forces, but it does bring Oleksandr Shelipov's widow Kateryna Shelipova justice.
Imposing the life sentence, Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, 21, had carried out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank.
""Given that the crime committed is a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order... the court does not see the possibility of imposing a [shorter] sentence of imprisonment,"" he said.
Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out.
His lawyer said an appeal would be lodged against the verdict.
The Kremlin's response is already in motion, with laws being drafted and courts being set up in Russia to try some Ukrainian prisoners as war criminals.
This suggests both countries could soon find themselves in a legal tit-for-tat while the conflict rages on.
Shishimarin served in Russia's Kantemirovskaya tank division. At the time of the killing, he and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit.
When they spotted Mr Shelipov he was speaking on his phone, Shishimarin told the court. He said he was told to shoot him with an assault rifle.
His defence lawyer told the court on Friday that Shishimarin had only fired after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three to four rounds had hit the man.
He said Shishimarin fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and he questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill.
In one dramatic moment, the victim's widow Kateryna Shelipova confronted Shishimarin. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?"" she asked, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine.
""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?""
The soldier had no answer to that. Asking forgiveness of the widow earlier, he said: ""But I understand you won't be able to forgive me.""
Ms Shelipova told the BBC: ""I feel very sorry for him but for a crime like that - I can't forgive him.""
Since President Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the UN.
Among the dead are numerous suspected victims of war crimes in occupied towns such as Bucha.
Earlier this month, the BBC obtained CCTV footage of the killing of two civilians in cold blood allegedly by Russian soldiers, a case now being investigated by prosecutors as a suspected war crime.

Severodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from Moscow's forces.
On Sunday, local officials said Russian troops were repelled after trying to enter the city from four directions.
It comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky urged world leaders to end all trade with Russia.
Speaking via video link at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Zelensky called for ""maximum sanctions"" to be imposed on Moscow, saying frozen Russian funds should be used to rebuild Ukrainian cities destroyed by the war.
""There has to be a precedent for punishing the aggressor,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""If the aggressor loses everything then it definitely deprives him of any motivation to start a war.""
Meanwhile, Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai accused Moscow of adopting a ""scorched-earth approach"" in its efforts to capture the city of Severodonetsk.
""Every day they are trying to break the line of defence,"" Mr Gaidai said. ""They are simply systematically destroying the city. Everywhere is being shelled constantly.""
The city of 100,000 people sits on a strategic position on the Donets River, with UK defence officials saying it has likely become one of Russia's ""immediate tactical priorities"".
Mr Gaidai warned that Russian forces have destroyed all but one bridge across the Donets river and said that the city is at risk of being cut off.
He also accused Russian tanks of firing on residential buildings during fighting in the city and of seeking to erase Severodonetsk ""from the face of the earth"".
Ukraine's human right's ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said the city risks suffering the same fate as Mariupol - being surrounded and pounded into submission.
""The enemy threw all his forces to storm Severodonetsk, on the outskirts of which there are constant battles,"" Ms Denisova wrote on Telegram.

We visited the Ukrainian front line yesterday and the main thrust of the Russian activities at the moment is at Severodonetsk. Kyiv's soldiers have told us it is largely surrounded and they are undoubtedly under pressure.
They've taken serious casualties and a Ukrainian military source said one unit that went into combat with 240 men returned with just 135 - the others killed, wounded or taken prisoner.
The Russians have taken some territory - villages and little towns - but it's a very heavily defended area. They've been fighting around there since 2014 and there are concrete Ukrainian positions that are hard to overcome.
A couple of days ago in Moscow, the ministry of defence said they would take the whole of the Luhansk region.
If Vladimir Putin can seize the whole of Luhansk and then do something similar in Donetsk, he could then say to Russians: ""This is a victory guys.""
It would be nothing like the victory he sought when all this started in February, but one he could declare anyway. The Ukrainian authorities are very anxious that doesn't happen.
Elsewhere, at least seven civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in Sunday's bombardment of the Donetsk region, according to the Ukrainian army's Facebook page.
Shelling and missile strikes have targeted Kharkiv in the north, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, officials said.
The UK's Ministry of Defence has said that Russia has likely suffered a similar number of casualties in Ukraine as it did during the entirety of the Soviet war in Afghanistan.
It said ""a combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes officials"" had contributed to the high figures.
It is unclear exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in its invasion.
Moscow, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official figures since March, when defence officials said some 1,351 troops had been killed.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has said the global number of forcibly displaced people has risen above 100 million for the first time.
Officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to the grim milestone. More than 14 million people are thought to have fled their homes since the war began on 24 February.
The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the announcement should serve as a wake up call for world leaders.
""The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,"" Mr Grandi said. ""But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure.

To Ukrainians it was clear from the very start of Russia's invasion that this was no ""special operation"" to liberate the Donbas region, as Vladimir Putin had declared. It was all-out war.
But in Russia it's a crime to call it that.
Dozens of people have already been prosecuted under the ""fake news"" law, as it's known. They face up to 15 years behind bars for challenging the official line on Russia's invasion or criticising the military.
It's a dramatic increase in censorship in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has spent his two decades in power removing opponents, stifling free speech and silencing the independent media: a dismantling of democracy that is having devastating consequences here in Ukraine.
Vladimir Kara-Murza tried to warn of the danger.
In a speech in the US in March, the Russian opposition activist lambasted Western leaders for seeking constant ""resets"" in relations with Mr Putin, allowing their countries to act as havens for tainted money and looking the other way even as Russia became ever less free.
""The whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine,"" Mr Kara-Murza told the Arizona House of Representatives, a fortnight into the war. ""The bombing of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. The war crimes. These are war crimes.""
But in Russia uttering such words is also a crime now.
A month after his speech, Mr Kara-Murza was picked up by police in Moscow and later charged with ""spreading false information"" about Russia's military. He's still in custody. The law he is accused of breaking was passed in March, soon after the invasion.
And yet Ukrainian prosecutors have already registered more than 11,000 alleged war crimes. A Russian soldier has admitted in court to shooting a civilian. And the BBC has gathered its own evidence, including CCTV footage of the shooting of two civilians by Russian forces.
Those returning to salvage what they can from the wreckage of Andriivka have more, powerful testimony.
When Russia invaded Ukraine, many families fled Kyiv for nearby villages like this, thinking they would be safer away from the capital. Instead they spent weeks cowering in cold cellars as occupying soldiers drove tanks into their yards and dug trenches in their vegetable plots.
After the Russians withdrew, in April, the village elder says the bodies of 13 residents were found here.
""They had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head,"" says Anatoliy Kibukevych. He then names every one of the victims.

""Truth is the regime's main enemy,"" says Evgenia Kara-Murza, Vladimir's wife, from Washington DC, where she lives for safety reasons. ""That's why I believe this regime is using this law to crush all dissent in Russia and to scare people into silence,""
""I'm sure Vladimir realised the risks were high. They have never been low for him,"" she says, with a reminder that her activist husband was poisoned twice in the past and nearly died.

When the war in Ukraine started, Lilia Yapparova felt compelled to cover it.
""I couldn't sleep, because people started to die… and I needed to be there,"" she told me in Kyiv, where for a while she was the only Russian reporter on the ground in Ukrainian-controlled areas.
There are only three even now - all women from independent media outlets. It's a tiny contingent compared with the Russian state TV correspondents who stride through eastern Ukraine in military clothing, ""Z"" patches on their arms in support of Russian soldiers, talking about ""denazification"" and the ""liberation"" of cities like Mariupol.
Ms Yapparova wanted to at least dent that solid wall of propaganda.
""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she says.
But that's a battle of its own, on top of the danger of working on Ukraine's frontlines.
Meduza, the news site Ms Yapparova writes for, has been banned in Russia, like almost all independent outlets. Journalists and media have been labelled as ""foreign agents"" while Facebook and other social media are blocked.
Meanwhile, state TV channels have all switched to wall-to-wall coverage of Russia's ""special operation"".
""For now we lost the war with propaganda,"" Ms Yapparova concedes, describing how even people she knows personally are absorbing the official line. She feels a sense of responsibility for that, although the odds were stacked impossibly against her.
And now she knows that every word she writes from Ukraine - true stories about the shooting of civilians, mass graves, terrible destruction - is putting her at risk of prosecution for ""fake news"".
""I am ready for that. I am not covering my eyes. I see the law for what it is,"" the journalist says. ""But I couldn't allow myself not to be here.""
It doesn't stop her worrying, though.
""Constantly. It hurts sometimes to write because I can't hide facts, but am I going to jail for that? Anything can happen.""
For Michael Nacke the danger is already real.
The young journalist left Russia before the war, escaping an environment that became increasingly repressive.
He is now a wanted man for telling the truth.
""I used the word 'war' instead of 'special operation',"" he says of his ""crime"" as set-out by Russian investigators in a 91-page statement. ""It doesn't matter which law they use against you, it's just to make you shut up.""
The prosecution is based on an episode on his YouTube channel in which he discusses how Russian tanks fired on a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. The incident was widely condemned, including at an emergency session of the UN Security Council. But Moscow claims Ukrainian forces set the fire themselves so in Russia that makes reporting anything else illegal.
""The one thing that I understand after this is that the work I do really matters,"" Mr Nacke says of the criminal case against him. ""I used to ask myself: 'Is my work effective to stop the war?' Now I see that it makes sense.""
The risks and consequences of this war are far more severe for Ukrainians, as every shattered inch of Andriivka shows.
""We've been through so much. Fear and horror,"" Alina Petrovna tells me, as her son nails tarpaulin over the holes left in their roof by the shockwaves of heavy shelling. The elderly lady lived in the family vegetable cellar for 29 days after Russian troops took over her village. She was terrified.
There are bullet holes in the front door where soldiers shot their way through to loot from them. The only thing they left untouched were her icons.
""Let the Russian people come and see what they did to us!"" Her eyes fill with angry tears. ""Fear and horror,"" she repeats.
But most in Russia will never even hear about such suffering. Because Vladimir Putin has not only launched a war on Russia's neighbour, he has declared a war on truth.

Watch Sofya's Story, how a Russian anti-war protester fled the country to escape persecution.To Ukrainians it was clear from the very start of Russia's invasion that this was no ""special operation"" to liberate the Donbas region, as Vladimir Putin had declared. It was all-out war.
But in Russia it's a crime to call it that.
Dozens of people have already been prosecuted under the ""fake news"" law, as it's known. They face up to 15 years behind bars for challenging the official line on Russia's invasion or criticising the military.
It's a dramatic increase in censorship in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has spent his two decades in power removing opponents, stifling free speech and silencing the independent media: a dismantling of democracy that is having devastating consequences here in Ukraine.
Vladimir Kara-Murza tried to warn of the danger.
In a speech in the US in March, the Russian opposition activist lambasted Western leaders for seeking constant ""resets"" in relations with Mr Putin, allowing their countries to act as havens for tainted money and looking the other way even as Russia became ever less free.
""The whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine,"" Mr Kara-Murza told the Arizona House of Representatives, a fortnight into the war. ""The bombing of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. The war crimes. These are war crimes.""
But in Russia uttering such words is also a crime now.
A month after his speech, Mr Kara-Murza was picked up by police in Moscow and later charged with ""spreading false information"" about Russia's military. He's still in custody. The law he is accused of breaking was passed in March, soon after the invasion.
And yet Ukrainian prosecutors have already registered more than 11,000 alleged war crimes. A Russian soldier has admitted in court to shooting a civilian. And the BBC has gathered its own evidence, including CCTV footage of the shooting of two civilians by Russian forces.
Those returning to salvage what they can from the wreckage of Andriivka have more, powerful testimony.
When Russia invaded Ukraine, many families fled Kyiv for nearby villages like this, thinking they would be safer away from the capital. Instead they spent weeks cowering in cold cellars as occupying soldiers drove tanks into their yards and dug trenches in their vegetable plots.
After the Russians withdrew, in April, the village elder says the bodies of 13 residents were found here.
""They had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head,"" says Anatoliy Kibukevych. He then names every one of the victims.
The main road - the route taken by Russian tanks ordered to seize Kyiv - is lined with the rubble of homes: heaps of singed bricks with metal bedframes or pots and pans oddly marooned in the middle of them. Painted pleas that read ""Children!"" or ""People!"" on garden gates have been pierced by shrapnel.

Under Welsh rules, many animals brought over have to be in quarantine centres for up to four months.
Elsewhere in the UK they can quarantine in homes after health checks.
The Welsh government said it wants to reduce the risk of rabies and has ""concerns about how the current home isolation process can be monitored and enforced effectively"".
Marianna Koniushenko, 18, who fled to Cardiff with her family, said her two dogs would help the trauma and anxiety she suffers after escaping Bucha in Ukraine.
Along with brother Roman, 14, and mother Larysa Martseva, she managed to escape, despite people in cars in front and behind them being killed by Russian troops.
But they had to leave their Rhodesian Ridgebacks Trisha and Vinchi in Dover when they arrived the UK on 26 April.
They are now in kennels in Poulton-le-Fylde, south of Blackpool and they do not know when they will be reunited.
Ms Koniushenko said she is suffering from trauma following their experiences, adding: ""I think the dogs could help me. I can hug them and tell them all about my problems.
""I feel really upset. It's like a part of me. The dogs are a part of our family.""
Her mum said: ""My children have lost a huge part of their emotional support. Their lives - their happy lives in their country - changed just like that.
""They had a nice life and it's very important for all of us to be all together.""
The family has been sent photos of the dogs by staff at the kennels, but Ms Martseva added: ""I was crying when I saw the photos because it's like giving children to an orphanage.
""We love Wales and our host family but half of our family isn't here.""
The family pleaded ""please let the dogs be with us"", with Ms Martseva saying: ""They are a five hour drive away. At least it would be great if the kennels were in Wales we're ready to drive to see them every day but we can't.""
In Montgomery, Powys, on the border with England, three generations of the Komrokova family now live with a host family.
Their three cats Senia, Charly and Flora are in a cattery, and they are trying to secure a temporary home for them nearby, in England, so they can visit them.
Rita, eight, who has additional learning needs, finds comfort from spending time with the cats.
Mark Michaels, who is hosting the family, said: ""We're a stone's throw from England here. You look out of the window and England is there it just seems desperately unfair. They would have chosen to be in England if they'd known they couldn't be with their animals.""
Vladyslav Sdarikov, 24, who lives in Conwy, said he and his girlfriend, Darya Holodiak would have thought of different options if they had known their one-year-old pug Taylor had to quarantine in a kennel.
Mr Sdarikov said: ""We cannot have him because of this invisible border for animals.""
Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said she worked closely with the chief veterinary officer when considering the rules.
""We haven't had rabies in this country for 100 years,"" she said.
""This is about protecting the animal that arrives from Ukraine. It's about protecting animals here in Wales and of course it's about public health as well.
""England and Scotland have chosen home confinement as a form of quarantine - how do you enforce that? How do you ensure that it absolutely takes place? It's impossible in my view.""
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We understand how important people's pets are to them and we want to do everything we can to ensure people seeking refuge in Wales are reunited with their pets safely and as quickly as possible.
""We also need to take steps to protect the health and welfare of all animals in Wales by reducing the risk of exposing them to diseases such as rabies.
""We have concerns about how the current home isolation process can be monitored and enforced effectively.""
He said this is why the decision was taken, adding: ""We fully recognise the distress this can cause pet owners, particularly those who have come to Wales after fleeing the atrocities in Ukraine.
""We will continue to assess different options to keep the time their pets are in quarantine to a minimum.""
The spokesman added there are quarantine places in Wales currently in use and efforts are being made to create more spaces.
The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had increased resources and streamlined processes to make sure those fleeing Ukraine with pets are not delayed.

The Ukrainian government says it will not agree a ceasefire deal with Russia that involves giving up territory.
The apparent hardening of Ukraine's position comes a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war could be resolved only through diplomacy.
Presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said concessions would lead to an even larger and bloodier Russian offensive.
His comments come as Russia continues attempts to encircle Ukrainian forces defending Severodonetsk in the east.
In another development, Polish President Andrzej Duda has become the first foreign leader to address the parliament in Kyiv in person.

He added that Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the EU.
However, France's Europe Minister, Clément Beaune, said in a radio interview on Sunday that it would probably take ""15 or 20 years"" for Ukraine to be accepted as an EU member.
As fighting continued, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in its daily update that Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defences to reach the administrative borders of the country's easternmost Luhansk region.
Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had attempted to break into Severodonetsk from four separate directions.

He added that a bridge connecting the city to nearby Lysychansk had been destroyed.

Sweden and Finland have formally applied to join the Western security alliance Nato.
Their decision was prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is being welcomed by most of the 30 existing countries in Nato.
However, Turkey is opposing either country joining the pact, saying the two countries support anti-Turkish terrorists.
Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a defensive military alliance. It was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France.
Members agree to come to one another's aid if they come under armed attack. Finland will take it to 31 members.
Nato's original aim was to counter Russian expansion in Europe after World War Two.
Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many of its former Eastern European allies joined Nato.
Both countries have been neutral for many years, but public support for joining Nato has grown since Russia invaded Ukraine.
It can take a year to apply and become a Nato member, and all member states must agree that a new country can join.
In order to join Nato, countries must be democracies, treat minorities fairly and commit to resolving conflicts peacefully.
They must also provide military support to the alliance.
Both Finland - which has a 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia - and Sweden have highly capable militaries.
Nato members agree to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. Finland already meets this target and Sweden says it will do so ""as soon as possible"".
However, one Nato member, Turkey, says it will refuse to let in either Sweden or Finland.
Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says the two countries have been harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation.
However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he is confident that Finland and Sweden will both join, despite Turkish objections.
As Ukraine isn't a member, Nato isn't obliged to come to its defence.
Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West.
This is also why Nato rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining a priority.
But this has not happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition.
Russia believes Nato has been encroaching on its area of political influence by accepting new members from eastern Europe - and admitting Ukraine would bring Nato into its backyard.
Ukraine's President Zelensky has accepted his country can't join Nato at present, saying: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this.""
Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining.
Initially, Nato countries limited their supplies to defensive weapons.
The UK and US sent thousands of anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles.
Slovakia sent its S-300 anti-aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles.
Several Nato countries are now sending heavier weapons, to enable Ukraine to counter-attack Russia's army.
The US is sending helicopters, artillery and armoured personnel carriers. It plans to offer a $33bn (£26bn) grant for security and economic assistance to Ukraine on top of the $3.7bn (£3bn) it has already spent.
The UK is offering an extra £300m in military support to Ukraine and plans to send armoured vehicles, electronic warfare equipment and anti-artillery radar systems.
The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine - the first time the EU has helped provide arms to a warzone.
Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic in the north to Romania in the south.
They had been stationed there in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Nato has now sent elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to countries bordering Russia and Ukraine.
It has fighter jets on alert and naval ships, including aircraft carrier groups, patrolling the seas.Sweden and Finland have formally applied to join the Western security alliance Nato.
Their decision was prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is being welcomed by most of the 30 existing countries in Nato.

Members agree to come to one another's aid if they come under armed attack. Finland will take it to 31 members.
Nato's original aim was to counter Russian expansion in Europe after World War Two.
Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many of its former Eastern European allies joined Nato.
Both countries have been neutral for many years, but public support for joining Nato has grown since Russia invaded Ukraine.
It can take a year to apply and become a Nato member, and all member states must agree that a new country can join.
In order to join Nato, countries must be democracies, treat minorities fairly and commit to resolving conflicts peacefully.
They must also provide military support to the alliance.
Both Finland - which has a 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia - and Sweden have highly capable militaries.
Nato members agree to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. Finland already meets this target and Sweden says it will do so ""as soon as possible"".
However, one Nato member, Turkey, says it will refuse to let in either Sweden or Finland.
Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says the two countries have been harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation.
However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he is confident that Finland and Sweden will both join, despite Turkish objections.
As Ukraine isn't a member, Nato isn't obliged to come to its defence.
Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West.
This is also why Nato rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
Nato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining a priority.
But this has not happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition.
Russia believes Nato has been encroaching on its area of political influence by accepting new members from eastern Europe - and admitting Ukraine would bring Nato into its backyard.
Ukraine's President Zelensky has accepted his country can't join Nato at present, saying: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this.""
Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining.
Initially, Nato countries limited their supplies to defensive weapons.
The UK and US sent thousands of anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles.
Slovakia sent its S-300 anti-aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles.
Several Nato countries are now sending heavier weapons, to enable Ukraine to counter-attack Russia's army.
The US is sending helicopters, artillery and armoured personnel carriers. It plans to offer a $33bn (£26bn) grant for security and economic assistance to Ukraine on top of the $3.7bn (£3bn) it has already spent.
The UK is offering an extra £300m in military support to Ukraine and plans to send armoured vehicles, electronic warfare equipment and anti-artillery radar systems.
The EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (£376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine - the first time the EU has helped provide arms to a warzone.
Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic in the north to Romania in the south.
They had been stationed there in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Nato has now sent elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to countries bordering Russia and Ukraine.
It has fighter jets on alert and naval ships, including aircraft carrier groups, patrolling the seas."

The evacuation marks the likely end of the battle for the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which lies in ruins after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment.
What happens next to the evacuated Azovstal fighters is unclear, with Ukraine calling for a prisoner swap but some in Russia suggesting they should be put on trial.
""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address after the evacuation of the steelworks began, adding that ""work continues to bring our lads home"".
But when and if that will happen is uncertain and details of the agreement brokered between the two sides, as well as the UN and the Red Cross, are unknown.
Ukraine says negotiations are ongoing to exchange the fighters for Russian prisoners of war, but Russia has not confirmed that a swap will take place.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the soldiers would be treated ""in line with the relevant international laws"", but there is concern over what will happen to them if they remain in Russian custody.
Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko told the BBC that if they are not returned to Ukraine, ""the fate of these very brave men will be absolutely unknown and will be in Russian hands, which is far from an ideal situation"".
The signals coming from Russia are concerning for Ukraine.
""Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,"" the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on Tuesday. ""We should do everything to ensure they are put on trial.""
Another senior politician, Leonid Slutsky, went further, calling the evacuated combatants ""animals in human form"" and saying they should be executed.
And the Donetsk separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, suggested that Ukrainians who are found to be ""neo-Nazi war criminals"" should face an international tribunal.
But Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar told the BBC that such statements ""were most likely made for domestic propaganda in Russia"".
Russia claims, without any evidence, that Ukraine is a Nazi hotbed, and one of the key aims of Russia's military operation in Ukraine is to ""denazify"" the country.
The Azov regiment, whose members are amongst those evacuated from Azovstal, is the most frequent target for Russia's claim that it is fighting against Nazis in Ukraine.
The regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia in 2014 but is now a National Guard unit, once had links to the far right.
Ultimately, it is likely to be Vladimir Putin who makes the final decision over what happens to the Azovstal fighters.
I think there was a sharp intake of breath right across this country when the news was announced that some of the last soldiers bunkered in the Azovstal steelworks were not just leaving, but leaving to territory occupied by Russia.
It was an impossible choice - if they stayed in the steelworks they would face certain death, but what they face now is, at best, a very, very uncertain fate.
President Zelensky for weeks and weeks had been telling the fighters ""please give up if you feel you must, please don't feel you must give your lives in this fight"".
Again and again the fighters of the Azov battalion said ""no, we must continue to fight"".
Last night President Zelensky said this mission to evacuate the remaining soldiers - and to take care of the ones who have already left - involved, in his words, the most influential international mediators.
Because the only thing which has reassured many here, and most of all the families of the fighters, is that there is international involvement, that behind the scenes there is the Red Cross and the United Nations, and they are hoping against hope this can help to persuade Russia.
Mariupol is a strategic prize for the Russians but members of the Azov battalion, a group which has origins in the far right, are a prize for President Putin, who it is feared may parade them to say ""see, I told you there were Nazis in Ukraine"".Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, who have been holed up in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol for weeks, have left their positions and handed themselves over to Russian forces and pro-Russian separatists, according to Russia's defence ministry.

There is still no end in sight to the fighting in Ukraine - but according to the country's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, the conflict can only be resolved through diplomacy.

But he indicated this would not be easy, as neither side wanted to give anything up - and negotiations between the two sides have stalled.
Meanwhile, on the ground, Russia's military said Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks had been ""completely liberated"", with the last Ukrainian defenders surrendering.
However, the exact number of fighters who are now in Russian hands is still not clear.
Russia claims more than 2,000 have surrendered, a number that hasn't been confirmed by Ukraine.
But the end of fighting in Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere - with fierce fighting reported around the city of Severodonetsk as Russia steps up its attempt to capture the whole eastern region of Luhansk.
Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with her husband.
This is only the second time the couple have been seen together since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
She said that even though she hadn't seen her husband for two and a half months, not even the war could take him away from her.
Kherson was the first city in Ukraine to be occupied by Russia. But in the past few weeks, more people have been seeking to leave the city as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory.
Escapees tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out.
The BBC spoke to Alexander, one of a number of volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war.
""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he says.
""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""

The end of fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol has freed up Russian troops for redeployment elsewhere and allowed them to intensify their onslaught in the east.
Local governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians were ""destroying"" Severodonetsk as they gradually surrounded it.
Writing on the messaging app Telegram, he said Ukrainian troops had repelled 11 attacks on the frontline - with eight tanks among the Russian vehicles destroyed. There was no independent confirmation of the claims.
BBC correspondent James Waterhouse said Russia had increased its artillery and air strikes as well as missile attacks - gaining ground mile by mile in Luhansk while the Ukrainians are forced to retreat.

Katerina closed her eyes and took a breath when I asked about her husband, a fighter, who is still thought to be in the maze of tunnels beneath the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.
She'd been calm and composed until now. She too spent more than two months in one of the bunkers under the vast industrial facility with her two sons where the bombardment felt like it would never end.
""The missiles were so heavy it felt like the bunker walls were moving and the rooms themselves became smaller,"" she told me.
""Sometimes there was a one-hour break and we hoped maybe that's it. Maybe that's the end of it. But no. They carried on.""
Behind us, her two boys, aged 6 and 11, were playing with guns made from paper and duct tape.
""They are adapting to being outside again,"" said Katerina.
""Seeing them running around in the sun again is the best feeling in the world.""
She remembers all three of them being ""blinded by light"" as they finally emerged after two months in their dark refuge under the steel plant.
As the two boys duck and dive behind the trees in the park, they pretend they're fighting Russians.  At one point they drop to the ground and shout 'cover your ears'. One gives the shout of 'all clear' and they stand up and get going again.
It's haunting to watch.
Even the games with the guns feel realistic as they practice putting in a fresh magazine of bullets. They have obviously seen this up close.
Katerina believes their father is still at the plant.  She heard from him earlier this week and he was his usual upbeat self.
""He is a very strong man, strong in spirit. He has been supporting me all my life.""
It was love at first sight, she told me with a smile. Their hometown of Mariupol has now been hollowed out by Russian bombs.
Katerina first took her two boys to the Azovstal steel plant in early March, just after the first strikes on the port city. She thought they would use it as a shelter for maybe one or two days - a week at most. But as the bombing intensified, they had to stay below ground for more than 60 days.
Supplies dwindled. Food and water became scarce - along with information. As Russian forces encircled the city, she and around 30 others in their bunker were cut off.
Occasionally she would get a visit from her husband as he and around 1,000 other Ukrainian fighters continued to defend the steel plant - their last holdout.
""Whenever he visited us there, he would always tell us to hang in there, boosting everyone's morale, joking, laughing, cheering, telling us that we should not worry and that everything is fine.
""It was frightening because they were coming and leaving under shelling. It was weird to see them that cheerful, but I don't think there was any other way. In terms of morale and spirit, I think he is one of the strongest there.""
Katerina was finally brought above ground during an operation to free civilians organised by the Red Cross and the United Nations.
I first met her at the evacuation centre in Zaporizhzhia. When she stepped off the bus she had everything she owned stuffed in a rucksack on her back.
""There were several times when we were losing hope that we would ever get out,"" she told me back then.
Now, two weeks on, she is trying to plan a future for her family.
Her home has been destroyed, she has spent two months in a cold and fetid bunker beneath a steel plant and now she is watching and waiting for news for her husband.
And yet she remains upbeat - resilient.

And yet she remains upbeat - resilient.
""I am confident that it will be fine for us. I'm confident that Ukraine is going to win and stay and independent state."""

On Tuesday, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Kyiv was doing ""everything possible and impossible"" to save the remaining fighters with the hope of exchanging them for captured Russian soldiers.

'My picture was used to spread lies about the war'
Russia's mainstream media outlets offer a view of the Ukraine war that is unlike anything seen from outside of the country. For a start, they don't even call it a war.
But on Monday night, viewers witnessed an extraordinary piece of television.
The programme was 60 Minutes, the flagship twice-daily talk show on Russian state TV: studio discussion that promotes the Kremlin line on absolutely everything, including on President Putin's so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The Kremlin still maintains that the Russian offensive is going according to plan. But studio guest Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, painted a very different picture.
He warned that ""the situation [for Russia] will clearly get worse"" as Ukraine receives additional military assistance from the West and that ""the Ukrainian army can arm a million people"".

A Ukrainian mother and her six children who fled Russian bombing have been handed the keys to their new home.
Lilia Onopa, 43, and her children received an official welcome in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on Friday.
She tearfully described seeing her hometown destroyed, people killed, and wanting to save her sons.
Having fled their home north of Dnipro, where military strikes began in early March, Ms Onopa and her boys travelled to Bucharest, Romania.
This was after attacks on the port city of Odesa made other methods of travel impossible.
They arrived in the Monmouthshire town last week after waiting five weeks for the British Embassy to approve their online application.
At the gathering, they were given the keys to a bungalow, a former caretaker's property which has been refurbished by volunteers from St Mary's RC Primary School and church with donations from across the area.
Speaking of the horrors she and her children had encountered after the war began, Ms Onopa thanked everyone who had helped them get to a place of safety, including the UK government who she said came to her aid when there were issues with their applications.
Ms Onopa said: ""The horrible situation happening to our country is because one person, one regime decided my country should not exist, that my nation should not exist.
""Imagine living next to a neighbour, he might have completely different opinions but you do live together.
""And one day your neighbour decides to invade your house, destroy your house, kill your kids, just because they think you're going to invade them.""
She said every mother would probably be able to understand how she was not scared for her own life, but those of her children.
""We saw our cities being destroyed, rockets falling on our houses and people dying, and the worst thing was we could do nothing to stop it,"" she added.
""All we could think about is what are we going to do next.""
Ms Onopa said she posted an appeal for help on social media and a group in the UK said they would help her.
She said travelling to the border she had seen thousands of displaced families, desperate for a route out of the war-torn areas.
""I was terrified I would lose my children so I wrote the addresses and contact details of my family in their rucksacks and clothes in the hope that should I die someone would  know where to take them to safety,"" she said.
Since arriving in the UK, Ms Onopa said she has felt ""overwhelmed"" with support.
""I don't have enough words to describe how grateful I am to everyone who helped,"" she said.
""I'm overwhelmed with the feeling that my kids can finally feel safe.""
Ms Onopa said she was keen to learn English and has already enrolled in classes.
Having been a keen cook and baker in Ukraine, she said she would like to start her own pastry business, and wants to volunteer to help other Ukrainian refugees settle.
She said her sons, aged between five and 15, were looking forward to beginning school.
But the devastation continuing in her own country where many of her family members and friends are still remains a source of fear and turmoil, she said.
""As a nation we haven't stopped fighting but its very difficult,"" she said.
""Just a couple of days ago I saw a 23-year-old boy from my village had been buried after being killed by the invaders.""
Presenting Ms Onopa with the keys, Archbishop of Cardiff George Stack said: ""This is an opportunity to say to our new family croesi i Gymru, welcome to Wales. The land of sanctuary.
""And we hope and pray that you will be happy and fulfilled and content as you begin to understand what wonderful people live and work in Wales.""

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now nearly into its fourth month.
It is worth remembering that many people, including perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin, did not expect it to last this long.
But instead of swiftly taking the capital Kyiv, Russia faced strong resistance and last month switched focus to trying to capture the eastern region known as the Donbas.
A US foreign policy adviser, Derek Chollet, says Russia has already suffered a ""strategic defeat"". ""Ukraine is stronger today and closer to the West,"" Mr Chollet says. ""And Nato is stronger as well.""
Despite this, fighting continues and shows no sign of ending, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"". You can see the latest mapping of the war here.
Mr Zelensky has also condemned a missile strike against a cultural centre in the Kharkiv region that reportedly injured seven people including an 11-year-old child, describing it as ""absolute evil, absolute stupidity"".
""What is in the heads of people who choose such targets?"" he said.
Central to Russian ambitions in Ukraine has been the city of Mariupol, which connects its eastern regions to the annexed Crimea.
Soldiers at the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city still in Ukrainian hands - say they have finally ended their defence.
They had vowed to fight until the end, but eventually were told they could get out and save their lives.
Since Monday, hundreds have left the site and taken to Russian-controlled towns. The exact number is not yet clear, though Russia claims almost 2,000 have surrendered.
What will happen next is still not clear.

Ukraine has dismissed as ""wishful thinking"" Russia's plan to connect a giant Ukrainian nuclear power station to the Russian electricity grid.
Russia's deputy prime minister has vowed to sell power from the sprawling Zaporizhzhia plant in the south of the country back to Ukraine - and if it won't pay, he said, then the electricity could be sent to Russia instead.

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61524175;2022-05-20;Ukraine war: What might tip the balance?;"Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down. Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks.
Overall, Russia is still the dominant force and has significant military might - but there has been no swift victory as planned. Here, we take a closer look at some of the things which could tilt the outcome in favour of either party.
In the north, a Ukrainian counter-offensive has successfully pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv. In the south, Russia has all but cleared out the final pockets of resistance in the port city of Mariupol. Both have been costly in terms of military and civilian casualties, but neither is likely to prove decisive.
What's happened in Mariupol and Kharkiv highlights the ebb and flow of this conflict. That pattern of costly gains and losses is now being repeated in the east of the country.
Russia has been making small but steady advances in the Donbas - the renewed focus of its offensive. But it's also suffered setbacks - as highlighted by the destruction earlier this month of dozens of Russian armoured vehicles trying to cross the Siversky Donets river.
In the east, each side is exchanging heavy, grinding blows using artillery. Ben Barry, a former British Army brigadier who is now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says that will continue to be the case in the battle of the Donbas.
He predicts artillery will be the main cause of casualties on both sides for weeks and months to come. Western officials have highlighted significant Russian losses, but they have been less willing to give estimates of Ukrainian casualties.
Ukraine is now receiving Western-supplied heavy weapons - including US M777 howitzers. It has also been sent counter-artillery radar systems - to help find and target Russia's artillery lines. But Ukraine is still outgunned.
Russia has been using its artillery and rocket launchers to tie down Ukrainian forces who are dug in - along well prepared defensive lines. Russia has been pressing from two main directions - from Izyum in the north and from the west around the city of Severedonetsk. They have made limited advances in both directions.
Brig Barry says it appears that Russia is ""trying to bleed Ukraine dry"" by forcing it to concentrate its forces at key points, which can then be targeted by its artillery. Military analysts believe Ukraine is likely to have suffered significant casualties as a result.
However, he says Ukraine will still be able to use urban areas in the Donbas to slow down Russia's advances. Fighting in town and cities, as has been shown throughout this war, favours the defender.
Once again, as in Mariupol, Russia is likely to try to grind resistance down - with the now familiar pattern of using mass artillery strikes until there remains little to defend. Ukraine's President Zelensky has already said Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has been ""completely destroyed"" and has described life there as ""hell"". It's going to get worse.
Military experts though still believe that Russia lacks the number of troops it needs to make significant advances in the east. Redeploying forces from the fight in  Kharkiv and Mariupol is unlikely to make a difference.
Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says Russia is still short of manpower and in particular infantry. Russia has tried to reconstruct and combine some of its already battered units - dubbed ""Frankenstein's Forces"".
Unit cohesion and morale of tired and depleted units is likely to be poor. A recent UK Ministry of Defence intelligence assessment concluded that Russian commanders were facing pressure to achieve results quickly and as a result were likely to redistribute forces without adequate preparation.
The ministry said that risked ""further attrition"". It is already claimed that Russia has already lost around a third of its original invasion force - an estimate that includes killed and wounded troops as well as equipment destroyed or damaged.
Mr Watling says Russia is trying to address these shortages - including mobilising reserves who are over 40 years old and offering short-term contracts to fill its ranks. But training and rebuilding an army takes time.
Russia has also proved vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks on its supply lines. But Ukraine's capacity to do this is likely to be limited with the bulk of its forces tied down in defensive positions.
No one thinks this war will be over quickly. It's not yet a stalemate. Russia is making advances - but very slowly. But the outcome of this war is unlikely to depend on military might alone.
Mr Watling says Russia is also pursuing economic and political levers to inflict as much damage on Ukraine as possible. While Russia's economy is taking a hit from Western sanctions, Ukraine's is likely to suffer even more.
Russia's GDP is expected to shrink by 12% over the next year, but Ukraine's GDP could fall by 50%. Russia's blockade of the Black Sea is causing significant damage.
Mr Watling says continuing Western economic, as well as military, support could prove crucial. Will the public's interest in the war wane the longer it goes on - just as it did after 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists first seized parts of the Donbas?
Western governments now also have to worry about their own domestic challenges, including rising inflation, gas and oil prices and a cost of living crisis - caused in part by the war.
When winter approaches it will be harder for armies to fight. It may also prove more difficult for the world to weather an economic storm.Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down.

Mr Watling says Russia is trying to address these shortages - including mobilising reserves who are over 40 years old and offering short-term contracts to fill its ranks. But training and rebuilding an army takes time.
Russia has also proved vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks on its supply lines. But Ukraine's capacity to do this is likely to be limited with the bulk of its forces tied down in defensive positions.
No one thinks this war will be over quickly. It's not yet a stalemate. Russia is making advances - but very slowly. But the outcome of this war is unlikely to depend on military might alone.
Mr Watling says Russia is also pursuing economic and political levers to inflict as much damage on Ukraine as possible. While Russia's economy is taking a hit from Western sanctions, Ukraine's is likely to suffer even more.
Russia's GDP is expected to shrink by 12% over the next year, but Ukraine's GDP could fall by 50%. Russia's blockade of the Black Sea is causing significant damage.
Mr Watling says continuing Western economic, as well as military, support could prove crucial. Will the public's interest in the war wane the longer it goes on - just as it did after 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists first seized parts of the Donbas?
Western governments now also have to worry about their own domestic challenges, including rising inflation, gas and oil prices and a cost of living crisis - caused in part by the war.
When winter approaches it will be harder for armies to fight. It may also prove more difficult for the world to weather an economic storm."

The policy for Guernsey's Ukraine sponsorship scheme will be considered by the states this week.
The Bailiwick confirmed it would introduce a homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme in early May 2022.
The policy aims to ensure all Ukrainian refugees who come to the island are provided with a ""safe, suitable and dignified"" sponsorship arrangement.
Deputy Rob Prow said a lot of work had been carried out to ensure the scheme worked for all involved.
The president of the committee for home affairs said ""we know there is a strong desire"" for the scheme to be in place as soon as possible.
""We expect further significant progress imminently which will then allow us to focus on the process of matching potential sponsors, who have appropriate accommodation available, with Ukrainian beneficiaries.""
The policy aims to create a ""positive relationship"" between the sponsor and Ukrainian, and to ensure they have access to appropriate community and public service support.
The states plan to introduce the scheme in a phased approach, with successful sponsors to be contacted in stages to ensure they are still able to offer support and accommodation.

Alexander is used to following tracks that are not shown on maps.
Knuckles white, he holds the steering wheel tightly as the van jolts down mud tracks and through undergrowth. These paths were once used by tractors or for scenic bike trips. Now any inch of them or the open fields could be mined, hit by shells or surrounded by military.
Alexander is just one of the volunteer drivers crossing the front line to evacuate civilians from Kherson and other Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
Quietly spoken, in his early twenties, he used to work in advocacy before the war.
""We can go along one road on the way in, but by the time we go back there's a crater from an explosion,"" he tells me. ""Then we know that the enemy shells have arrived. Then we pray, you can shell a little to the left, a little to the right. Just leave us a corridor in the middle so we can get people out.""
In the last few weeks the volunteers say they have seen more demand from people wanting to leave Kherson as Russia tightens its grip on occupied territory. Arrivals tell stories of intimidation by Russian police, soaring food prices and fear of kidnap by the authorities. Despite the risks, they say, many still want to make the journey out.
Evacuating the city has been difficult. The UN and the Red Cross told us they have not run any evacuation routes as they've been unable to get safety guarantees from both sides.
Instead, volunteer drivers like Alexander negotiate the checkpoints and routes without any formal agreements. We are using false names for both drivers travelling into Kherson to protect their identities.
""You must have a cold mind and a firm heart,"" says Oleg. ""Otherwise, you won't get to the final destination.""
Oleg used to be a builder. He greets us with a broad smile and a piece of salted fish, a gift from Kherson that he carried in the glove compartment. He returned last night. It was a tough journey.
""Every new ride gets harder and harder. The old routes are closed and we must look for new ones.""
Oleg explains the process he follows, checking all the passengers' passports and documents, carrying a first aid kit. But following a plan is nearly impossible. For the last two days they arrived at the checkpoint at 05:00, only to wait until evening along with what he estimates to be around 2,000 other vehicles. No one, he says, was let through.
""We decided to go the way that is not yet open, because there are active battles there. It's a very fast route and because the women and children were so exhausted, we had to take risks. It was agreed by all passengers.""
The team was lucky.
Two other vans are still in Kherson, trying to make the journey out. One is driven by Alexander. They haven't been heard from since last night.
The drivers are part of a volunteer organisation that sprung up from a Telegram channel called Odessa As It Is. In the group's evacuation hub, volunteers pile vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and nappies into rescue packs for new arrivals.
Julia Pogrebnaya, one of the key co-ordinators here, flicks anxiously through her phone as she shows us around. Normally the first to smile and laugh, today she is tense.
""I don't sleep,"" she says. ""I feel like I can't breathe out until the drivers are back. I worry about everything. We have a lot of responsibility.""
Does she worry that they are encouraging people to take big risks?
""We have to do it. As we speak now we have about 5,500 people on the list that want to be evacuated from Kherson, not even counting from the surrounding villages.""
Julia tells us she will let us know about the drivers. As we leave, I spot her sitting at her desk, one hand holding her phone, the other brushing away tears.
It was the first day of the war when Puryshev Mykhailo made the decision to go to Mariupol. He arrived with humanitarian products and left with evacuees. That was the first of his seven trips.
""If I had waited for a safe corridor, I probably would have waited until now,"" he tells me. ""After I spent six days in a bomb shelter watching what children in the city were going through, something broke in me. At that moment I decided I would continue to do these trips.
""I just do it because I feel like it needs to be done. And to be honest, I would never have imagined that I was capable of such a thing.""
Puryshev has filmed much of the last few weeks, from the smiling faces of the children he's evacuated to sheltering from shelling during a pick-up.
""Driving through the road, it can be difficult to distinguish what is dirt and what is a corpse,"" he says quietly.
""Sometimes it is both mixed together. I saw bodies wrapped in carpets, others buried right next to the entrance of the house. You try not to dwell on it because you have a goal, to take people out alive.""
In Odessa, there is news of the drivers.
After frantic calls to the military, the hub have heard that both drivers were hit. Following the same path Oleg had taken a few hours before, one driver was in Russian territory, they tell us, when he was shelled. He is in hospital in Ukrainian-held territory with a severe head injury, his skull fractured and part of his ear severed. One passenger died, another is also in hospital.
A few hours later, Alexander left Kherson travelling in convoy with a car, only to come across a tank that turned them back. The driver of the car, Alexander's friend, was shot in the head by a sniper. Alexander survived, rescuing a passenger from the car to his van before escaping through shelling.
When I speak to Julia, the team is shaken, but say they will continue.
""We had calls from people, crying for us to come,"" she tells me. ""We have no choice, but to help them.""Alexander is used to following tracks that are not shown on maps.

Both countries submitted their applications to be part of the Western defence alliance this week, marking a major shift in European geopolitics.
To join the alliance, the two nations need the support of all 30 Nato member states.
But the move by the Nordic nations has been opposed by Turkey.
Speaking alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto at the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden called Sweden and Finland's applications ""a watershed moment in European security"".
""New members joining Nato is not a threat to any nation,"" he said. The president added that having two new members in the ""high north"" would ""enhance the security of our allies and deepen our security co-operation across the board"".
Russia has repeatedly said it sees Nato as a threat and has warned of ""consequences"" if the block proceeds with its expansion plans.
Turkey has accused both Sweden and Finland of hosting suspected militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation.
However, both Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and British Defence Minister Ben Wallace have expressed confidence that these concerns will eventually be addressed.
Mr Biden's comments came as the US Senate voted to approve a new $40bn (£32bn) bill to provide military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It is the biggest emergency aid package so far for Ukraine.
The bill - which was passed by the House of Representatives with broad bipartisan support on 10 May - was expected to be passed earlier this week, but was blocked by Kentucky Republican Rand Paul over a dispute about spending oversight.
But the Republican's Senate leader Mitch McConnell dismissed these concerns and told reporters that Congress had a ""moral responsibility"" to support ""a sovereign democracy's self-defence"".
""Anyone concerned about the cost of supporting a Ukrainian victory should consider the much larger cost should Ukraine lose,"" Mr McConnell said.
Last week, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Congress to approve the package and warned that the US military only had enough funds to send weapons to Kyiv until 19 May.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the aid package as ""a significant US contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"".
The package brings the total US aid delivered to Ukraine to more than $50bn, including $6bn for security assistance such as training, equipment, weapons and support.
Another $8.7bn will be allocated to replenish stocks of US equipment already sent to Ukraine.Sweden and Finland have the ""full, total and complete backing"" of the US in their decision to apply for Nato membership, President Joe Biden says.

The French carmaker said it would sell its 68% interest to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow.
Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property.
It is the first Russian nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine.
""Agreements were signed on the transfer of Russian assets of the Renault Group to the Russian Federation and the government of Moscow,"" Russia's industry and trade ministry said.
Financial details of the deal were not provided, but in April Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Renault planned to sell its Russian assets for ""one symbolic rouble"".
In a statement on Monday, Renault Group said its board of directors had approved agreements to sell Renault Russia to the Moscow city entity, as well as its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to the Russian Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute (Nami).
The deal also included Renault's Moscow plant, Avtoframos, which makes Renault and Nissan models.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said production at the plant would now resume under the Soviet-era Moskvich brand.
Renault boss Luca de Meo said: ""Today, we have taken a difficult but necessary decision; and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia, while preserving the group's performance and our ability to return to the country in the future, in a different context.""
The agreement, which Renault said would cost the company an estimated €2.2bn ($2.29bn), includes an option for the group to buy back its interest in Avtovaz for six years.
Avtovaz is Russia's largest carmaker and makes the country's popular Lada brand.
In March, Renault announced it was suspending operations at its Moscow factory.
It came after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Renault and other French companies to leave Russia, accusing them of ""financing the murders of women and children"".
Renault's chief executive Luca de Meo said the firm was making a responsible choice - but just how much choice did it actually have?
In the early stages of the conflict, the company prevaricated, choosing to remain in Russia while other international brands were leaving.
But after being name-checked by Ukraine's President Zelensky, who said Western firms in Russia were helping to finance Vladimir Putin's war, it suspended its operations in late March.
Abandoning its Russian business will be costly - Renault's own estimate is $2.3bn. It will lose a major market once seen as a key avenue for growth. And it will lose Lada as well - a brand that was central to Renault's strategy for affordable cars.
Arguably, Renault could not remain in Russia. Yet the damage to its reputation has already been severe.
Hundreds of international brands including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple have left Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February, with many now looking to sell their businesses in the country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.
Lasers work by sending out a beam of infrared light that heats up its target until it combusts.
An expert told the BBC that even advanced laser weapons are still too weak to make a significant difference on the battlefield.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.
Lasers work by sending out a beam of infrared light that heats up its target until it combusts.
An expert told the BBC that even advanced laser weapons are still too weak to make a significant difference on the battlefield.

McDonald's has found a buyer for its 850 restaurants and staff in Russia, after the war in Ukraine pushed it to quit the country.
Alexander Govor, who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, will operate them under a new brand, the fast food giant said.
McDonald's had operated in Russia for more than 30 years.
The opening of its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions.

There is not a great deal to see here, apart from the chicken farm and the church that was reduced to rubble in World War Two.
But there is one thing in this town that is particularly eye-catching: the local shopping centre.
Dmitry Skurikhin owns the building - and you should see what he's done to the front of it.
In giant letters he's painted ""Peace to Ukraine, Freedom to Russia!"" In bright-red paint he's listed the names of Ukrainian towns that have been attacked by the Russian army.
Mariupol, Bucha, Kherson, Chernihiv, and many more.
""I thought this would be a good way of getting information out,"" Dmitry tells me.
""Because for the first few weeks of the war our people didn't know what was happening. They thought that some kind of special operation was being conducted to remove drug addicts from the Ukrainian government. They didn't know that Russia was shelling Ukrainian towns.""
Dmitry has even turned the roof of his shop into a giant yellow and blue Ukrainian flag.
Suddenly, out comes a paint pot and brush and Dmitry adds more names.
Borodyanka, Odesa, Irpin… The excess paint drips down the wall, blood red, making this statement all the more powerful.
Dmitry knows that what he's doing is not without risk. In Russia public protest often ends in prosecution or threats. Or both. Someone has already graffitied ""traitor"" on his door. And the police have been round to visit. He was later fined for discrediting the Russian armed forces.
Dmitry is unrepentant.
""I couldn't just sit doing nothing. It would have torn me apart inside. But what I am doing is an act of desperation. Now Russians are outcasts. We deserve to be. This offensive will cast a shadow over us for a long time.""
The Kremlin likes to portray President Vladimir Putin as a leader who is supported by his people. The authorities insist that Russians back him on Ukraine. Dmitry claims it is an illusion.
""If you ask people here, are they in favour of war between Russia and Ukraine, with the shelling of towns, plus all the consequences like poverty and hunger, they would say: 'Are you mad?!'"" Dmitry tells me.
""Russians are being exposed to disinformation. They support the special military operation that they're being told about on TV. But people are starting to realise that what's really happening is a calamity.""
Outside the shopping centre, I ask passers-by what they think of Dmitry's paint protest.
""He's an idiot. An idiot! Covering the wall with that dog's dinner!"" exclaims one shopper. ""He'd have been better off painting a picture on the wall!""
The next person I ask happens to be Dmitry's 87-year-old former biology teacher from school.
""No one wants war, I still remember World War Two,"" says Maria Nikolaevena. ""But it's all very well saying we don't want war. Perhaps our government knows better.""
""He has the right to express his opinion,"" says a young man called Anton. ""And I'm worried, too, about Ukraine, because attacking, bombing a neighbouring country is a strange thing to do.""

Twitter has said it plans to put misleading tweets from official accounts about the Ukraine war behind warning notices.
The change follows heightened scrutiny of the social media platform after the war unleashed a new surge of misinformation, sometimes from government sources.
Twitter has already limited content from more than 300 Russian government accounts, including President Putin.
But it also faces free speech concerns.
Under the company's new ""crisis"" policies, Twitter will prioritise labelling false posts from accounts with wide reach, like state media or official government accounts, while preserving them for ""accountability"" reasons.
Users will be required to click through the warning notice to view the post and Twitter will disable the ability to like, retweet or share the content.
Twitter said it would also change its search and explore features to avoid amplifying false tweets.
""While this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis,"" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of security and safety wrote in a blog post announcing the changes.
Twitter said examples of problematic posts included false or misleading allegations of war crimes, false information regarding the international response and false allegations regarding use of force.
The company said it would rely on multiple sources to determine when claims are misleading. Strong commentary and first person accounts are among the types of tweets that would not be challenged by the policy, it said.
The new policies come just weeks after Twitter's board agreed to a $44bn (£34.5bn) takeover offer from billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has called for less moderated speech on the platform.
He has said he would revoke Twitter's controversial ban of former US President Donald Trump, whom Twitter suspended citing the risk that he would incite further violence.

Social media companies don't want to act as referees of the truth, but they now have so much power over what we see that they feel increasingly compelled to act as information judge and jury.
Twitter's new crisis policies are geared towards war and conflict. It's hard not to see them through the lens of war in Ukraine, where there's been an intense information war.
But of course there are other conflicts where these rules might apply - take Myanmar, where a civil war rages and where social media played a key role in a deadly slaughter, according to the UN.
Announcing a rule is one thing, but implementing it is another. The company uses automated systems but user reporting is rather limited. Twitter has only rolled out its misinformation reporting tool to the US and handful of other countries.

You may have heard Twitter might have a new owner soon - one whose views tend to be more laissez-faire than the current management.
We don't yet have a very clear idea of what Elon Musk will do about moderation - if he does eventually take control.
Mr Roth said Twitter had started working on the new policies for crisis situations before the invasion of Ukraine, though the conflict had highlighted their importance.
Early in the war, the company took steps to limit the reach of Russian media accounts. But it did not have a clear approach to disinformation spread by political figures or government accounts.
While moderators did remove some posts, experts called the lack of strategy regarding government propaganda a ""critical gap"" in the firm's moderation policies.
Last month Twitter said it had identified more than 300 Russian government accounts that it would stop recommending in timelines, notifications or elsewhere on the site.
On a call with reporters, Mr Roth said the firm had seen ""both sides share information that may be misleading and/or deceptive"".

Nato's secretary general says Russia's war in Ukraine is not going to plan and that its attempt to capture the eastern Donbas region has ""stalled"".
Jens Stoltenberg also said Ukraine could win the conflict.
Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February.
The Russian invasion has been hampered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues.
Its initial goal appeared to be to sweep across the country and topple the Ukrainian government. Instead, Russia has withdrawn from areas around the capital Kyiv after failing to capture it and since mid-April has been focusing its efforts on two eastern provinces.
In Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, officials say Russian forces have withdrawn from to the border and that residents were returning.
""Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,"" said Mr Stoltenberg.
""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives.""
Mr Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers.
On top of the military setbacks, another consequence of the invasion is that Russia will likely face an expanded Nato with Sweden and Finland set to join.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Nato as a security threat to Russia and invaded Ukraine in part to stop it joining Nato.
In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured.
The MoD said Russia's Donbas offensive had ""lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"".
It said Russia was constrained by ""continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness"".
The British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, said Ukraine's allies must keep up their military support to help it ""push Russia out"".

BBC;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61442387;2022-05-15;Ukraine: The children's camp that became an execution ground;"We use cookies to give you the best online experience. Please let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.
Since Russian forces were pushed back from Kyiv at the end of March, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha region - many hastily buried in shallow graves. The BBC has learned that around 650 people were shot in what a senior police official has described as executions. Sarah Rainsford has been investigating what happened at a children's summer camp - now being treated as a crime scene.
*This report contains material some readers will find disturbing*
It is easy to miss the killing spot at first in the gloom. But in a cold, damp basement on the edge of the woods that made Bucha a popular get-away spot before the war, five Ukrainian men were forced to their knees and shot in the head.
To the right of the entrance, there are stones coated in blood that has turned dark red. Lying among that is a blue woollen hat with an exit hole in one side and its rim soaked in blood. In the wall, I counted at least a dozen bullet holes.
A couple of steps away are the remains of a Russian military ration pack - an open can of rice porridge with beef and an empty packet of crackers. A name daubed in graffiti on a wall is a reminder that the scene is a children's camp. But when Russian troops moved into Bucha, just outside the capital, in early March, Camp Radiant became an execution ground.
The story of the summer camp killings is chilling but so is this detail: more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the Bucha region during a month under Russian occupation, but most did not die from shrapnel or shelling. More than 650 were shot dead by Russian soldiers, according to a senior police official.
Now Ukraine is searching for their killers.
Volodymyr Boichenko lived in Hostomel, just up the road from Bucha and near the airfield where the first Russian forces landed to try to overthrow Ukraine's government. When his sister Aliona Mykytiuk decided to flee before the fighting reached her, she pleaded with Volodymyr to join her. He was a civilian, not a soldier, but he wanted to stay and help. So he spent the days searching Hostomel for food and water to bring to neighbours, including children, who were trapped in their cellars by the constant shelling and Russian airstrikes.
A chatty 34-year-old, who had travelled the world in the merchant navy, Volodymyr phoned his family from Hostomel most days to reassure them he was safe. Aliona would wait nervously for his brief calls: she knew he had to move to higher ground to get a connection and if the shelling was heavy it was impossible to leave the bomb shelter. As supplies ran low, she urged her brother to try to escape but by then the roads were blocked.
The last time Aliona heard from him was on 8 March. Volodymyr wasn't the demonstrative type, but that day he told his sister not to worry about him. ""He said 'I really love you,' and that was so painful to hear,"" Aliona sobs, rubbing her eyes hard but unable to stop the tears. ""There was fear in his voice.""
Four days later, Volodymyr was spotted by neighbours close to Promenystyi, as it's known here, or Camp Radiant. Then he disappeared.
In March, the fighting around Kyiv was intense and the small town of Bucha was at the epicentre. The withdrawal of Russian troops in early April revealed scenes that shocked the world: the bodies of residents slumped in the streets where they'd been shot.
Moscow tells anyone who will listen that the killings were staged, an idea that is as twisted as it is patently false. Determined to hold those responsible to account, Ukrainian investigators are busy collecting the hard evidence on territory now back under their control.
""We don't know what Putin's plans are, so we are working as quickly as possible in case he drops a bomb and destroys all the proof,"" says Kyiv regional police chief, Andrii Niebytov.
That evidence includes a field full of civilian cars pierced with multiple bullet holes, now piled up on the edge of Bucha. They are vehicles that were shot at when families tried to flee. One still has a length of white cloth at the window, hung to show the soldiers that its occupants were no threat. Step too close, and you catch the sickly smell of death.
When the bodies beneath Camp Radiant were discovered on 4 April, Volodymyr Boichenko was among them. Aliona had spent weeks frantically calling hospitals and morgues. That day she was sent a photograph to identify. She knew it was her brother before it had even downloaded.
""I hate them with every cell of my being,"" Aliona cries, about Volodymyr's killers. ""I know that's wrong to say about people, but they are not human. There was not one patch on those men's bodies that was not beaten.""
The five men had been found crouching on their knees, heads down and hands bound behind their backs.
""We know they had been tortured,"" the police chief told the BBC. ""The Russian army has crossed the line of how war is conducted. They were not fighting the military in Ukraine, they were kidnapping and torturing the civilian population.""
Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the SBU security service will disclose details of ongoing investigations, but some Russian military were so careless at covering their tracks that there are likely to be considerable clues to work with. Ukrainian territorial defence units have even discovered lists of soldiers at some abandoned positions. One appears to be part of a rota for litter duty, another includes passport details and mobile phone numbers.
With such a vast volume of work - more than 11,000 potential war crimes cases registered so far - Ukraine's security services have called on more digitally savvy civilians for help.
""I feel some call of duty,"" said Dmytro Replianchuk, a journalist at slidstvo.info who worked to expose corruption within Ukraine's law enforcement bodies before the war. Now he's joined forces with prosecutors, scouring the internet for extra data to help catch suspected war criminals.
""I understand it will be so hard and a lot of cases won't be solved. But in these weeks, it's important to find as much information as possible,"" Dmytro explained.
We found one potential clue among the litter at Camp Radiant - the wrapping from a parcel sent by a woman named Ksyukha to a Russian soldier whose own name and military unit are clearly marked. Unit 6720 is based in Rubtsovsk, in the Altai region of Siberia. It has been linked to Bucha before when soldiers from the town were caught on CCTV sending giant packages to relatives full of goods that they had looted from Ukrainian homes.
We can't be sure yet whether soldiers from Rubtsovsk were based at the children's camp, or were there when the men were killed. The police first need to establish a more precise time of death.
""We are working on it, but it's not a quick thing,"" Mr Niebytov  explains. ""But that camp was a headquarters so there would have been a commander. The soldiers could not have executed anyone without the commander's knowledge. So we will first find the organisers and then look for the implementers.""
Across the road from Camp Radiant, behind a church spattered with shrapnel damage, a corner of Bucha is slowly showing renewed signs of life. Young boys run around the yard, while a man fixes sheets of wood to windows shattered when the town was being shelled, constantly. And a little shop has just reopened to serve others now trickling back to begin their own repairs.
As neighbours cross paths, they discuss the days when Russian tanks rolled into their town, the soldiers who would shoot wildly and those who roamed the streets drunk, breaking into homes and stealing from them. And they remember the local man who escaped to their block of flats from the summer camp opposite, and who they had sheltered despite the risk.
Viktor Sytnytskyi didn't know Camp Radiant before, but all the details he gives match up. He's now in western Ukraine and told me his story over the phone, calling from his car so he wouldn't upset his mother.
It was early March when Viktor was grabbed by Russian soldiers on the street. They tied his hands and pulled his hat down over his eyes, then dragged him to a cellar that he's sure was on the grounds of the children's camp.
There, the Russians poured water over his legs so he would freeze, and they held a gun to his head.
""They kept saying, 'Where's the fascists? Where's the troops? Where's Zelensky? One of them mentioned Putin so I said something rude and he hit me,"" Viktor recalls.
He remembers being angry at his captors as well as terrified. He had worked in Moscow in the past with men from Siberia and was horrified that Russians could now treat him with such brutality. Even more so, when one of the soldiers revealed that he, too, was from Siberia.
Viktor told him he was sad things had come to this.
""The sad thing is that our grandfathers fought together against the Nazis and now you're the fascists,"" was the Russian's angry reply.
""He told me: 'You have until the morning to remember what you've seen, and if not, you'll be shot.'""
That night, Viktor got lucky. There was heavy shelling and when he realised his captors were no longer guarding him, he ran for his life.
""I calculated that I had more chance of surviving under shelling than if I stayed in that cellar. They'd already put the gun to my head. What would it cost them to pull the trigger?""
From a common grave beneath the children's camp, Volodymyr Boichenko has now been given a proper burial beneath the cherry blossom in the old cemetery of Bucha.
After his funeral, Aliona says she finally saw her brother's face in her dreams again, as if he were comforting her.
But she still has many questions. The cross on Volodymyr's grave is marked only with his birthday, not the date of his death, because the family have no idea when he was shot.
They may never know, unless the Russian commander who took over Camp Radiant can be found.
Like everyone in Bucha, though, they do know that civilians are not only caught up in this war. They are being targeted - by Russian soldiers who either don't know the rules of war, or don't care.

Additional reporting:  Daria Sipigina, Mariana Matveichuk and Tony BrownSince Russian forces were pushed back from Kyiv at the end of March, the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been discovered in the Bucha region - many hastily buried in shallow graves. The BBC has learned that around 650 people were shot in what a senior police official has described as executions. Sarah Rainsford has been investigating what happened at a children's summer camp - now being treated as a crime scene.
*This report contains material some readers will find disturbing*
It is easy to miss the killing spot at first in the gloom. But in a cold, damp basement on the edge of the woods that made Bucha a popular get-away spot before the war, five Ukrainian men were forced to their knees and shot in the head.
To the right of the entrance, there are stones coated in blood that has turned dark red. Lying among that is a blue woollen hat with an exit hole in one side and its rim soaked in blood. In the wall, I counted at least a dozen bullet holes.
A couple of steps away are the remains of a Russian military ration pack - an open can of rice porridge with beef and an empty packet of crackers. A name daubed in graffiti on a wall is a reminder that the scene is a children's camp. But when Russian troops moved into Bucha, just outside the capital, in early March, Camp Radiant became an execution ground.
The story of the summer camp killings is chilling but so is this detail: more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the Bucha region during a month under Russian occupation, but most did not die from shrapnel or shelling. More than 650 were shot dead by Russian soldiers, according to a senior police official.
Now Ukraine is searching for their killers.
Volodymyr Boichenko lived in Hostomel, just up the road from Bucha and near the airfield where the first Russian forces landed to try to overthrow Ukraine's government. When his sister Aliona Mykytiuk decided to flee before the fighting reached her, she pleaded with Volodymyr to join her. He was a civilian, not a soldier, but he wanted to stay and help. So he spent the days searching Hostomel for food and water to bring to neighbours, including children, who were trapped in their cellars by the constant shelling and Russian airstrikes.
A chatty 34-year-old, who had travelled the world in the merchant navy, Volodymyr phoned his family from Hostomel most days to reassure them he was safe. Aliona would wait nervously for his brief calls: she knew he had to move to higher ground to get a connection and if the shelling was heavy it was impossible to leave the bomb shelter. As supplies ran low, she urged her brother to try to escape but by then the roads were blocked.
The last time Aliona heard from him was on 8 March. Volodymyr wasn't the demonstrative type, but that day he told his sister not to worry about him. ""He said 'I really love you,' and that was so painful to hear,"" Aliona sobs, rubbing her eyes hard but unable to stop the tears. ""There was fear in his voice.""
Four days later, Volodymyr was spotted by neighbours close to Promenystyi, as it's known here, or Camp Radiant. Then he disappeared.
In March, the fighting around Kyiv was intense and the small town of Bucha was at the epicentre. The withdrawal of Russian troops in early April revealed scenes that shocked the world: the bodies of residents slumped in the streets where they'd been shot.
Moscow tells anyone who will listen that the killings were staged, an idea that is as twisted as it is patently false. Determined to hold those responsible to account, Ukrainian investigators are busy collecting the hard evidence on territory now back under their control.
""We don't know what Putin's plans are, so we are working as quickly as possible in case he drops a bomb and destroys all the proof,"" says Kyiv regional police chief, Andrii Niebytov.
That evidence includes a field full of civilian cars pierced with multiple bullet holes, now piled up on the edge of Bucha. They are vehicles that were shot at when families tried to flee. One still has a length of white cloth at the window, hung to show the soldiers that its occupants were no threat. Step too close, and you catch the sickly smell of death.
When the bodies beneath Camp Radiant were discovered on 4 April, Volodymyr Boichenko was among them. Aliona had spent weeks frantically calling hospitals and morgues. That day she was sent a photograph to identify. She knew it was her brother before it had even downloaded.
""I hate them with every cell of my being,"" Aliona cries, about Volodymyr's killers. ""I know that's wrong to say about people, but they are not human. There was not one patch on those men's bodies that was not beaten.""
The five men had been found crouching on their knees, heads down and hands bound behind their backs.
""We know they had been tortured,"" the police chief told the BBC. ""The Russian army has crossed the line of how war is conducted. They were not fighting the military in Ukraine, they were kidnapping and torturing the civilian population.""
Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the SBU security service will disclose details of ongoing investigations, but some Russian military were so careless at covering their tracks that there are likely to be considerable clues to work with. Ukrainian territorial defence units have even discovered lists of soldiers at some abandoned positions. One appears to be part of a rota for litter duty, another includes passport details and mobile phone numbers.
With such a vast volume of work - more than 11,000 potential war crimes cases registered so far - Ukraine's security services have called on more digitally savvy civilians for help.
""I feel some call of duty,"" said Dmytro Replianchuk, a journalist at slidstvo.info who worked to expose corruption within Ukraine's law enforcement bodies before the war. Now he's joined forces with prosecutors, scouring the internet for extra data to help catch suspected war criminals.
""I understand it will be so hard and a lot of cases won't be solved. But in these weeks, it's important to find as much information as possible,"" Dmytro explained.
We found one potential clue among the litter at Camp Radiant - the wrapping from a parcel sent by a woman named Ksyukha to a Russian soldier whose own name and military unit are clearly marked. Unit 6720 is based in Rubtsovsk, in the Altai region of Siberia. It has been linked to Bucha before when soldiers from the town were caught on CCTV sending giant packages to relatives full of goods that they had looted from Ukrainian homes.
We can't be sure yet whether soldiers from Rubtsovsk were based at the children's camp, or were there when the men were killed. The police first need to establish a more precise time of death.
""We are working on it, but it's not a quick thing,"" Mr Niebytov  explains. ""But that camp was a headquarters so there would have been a commander. The soldiers could not have executed anyone without the commander's knowledge. So we will first find the organisers and then look for the implementers.""
Across the road from Camp Radiant, behind a church spattered with shrapnel damage, a corner of Bucha is slowly showing renewed signs of life. Young boys run around the yard, while a man fixes sheets of wood to windows shattered when the town was being shelled, constantly. And a little shop has just reopened to serve others now trickling back to begin their own repairs.
As neighbours cross paths, they discuss the days when Russian tanks rolled into their town, the soldiers who would shoot wildly and those who roamed the streets drunk, breaking into homes and stealing from them. And they remember the local man who escaped to their block of flats from the summer camp opposite, and who they had sheltered despite the risk.
Viktor Sytnytskyi didn't know Camp Radiant before, but all the details he gives match up. He's now in western Ukraine and told me his story over the phone, calling from his car so he wouldn't upset his mother.
It was early March when Viktor was grabbed by Russian soldiers on the street. They tied his hands and pulled his hat down over his eyes, then dragged him to a cellar that he's sure was on the grounds of the children's camp.
There, the Russians poured water over his legs so he would freeze, and they held a gun to his head.
""They kept saying, 'Where's the fascists? Where's the troops? Where's Zelensky? One of them mentioned Putin so I said something rude and he hit me,"" Viktor recalls.
He remembers being angry at his captors as well as terrified. He had worked in Moscow in the past with men from Siberia and was horrified that Russians could now treat him with such brutality. Even more so, when one of the soldiers revealed that he, too, was from Siberia.
Viktor told him he was sad things had come to this.
""The sad thing is that our grandfathers fought together against the Nazis and now you're the fascists,"" was the Russian's angry reply.
""He told me: 'You have until the morning to remember what you've seen, and if not, you'll be shot.'""
That night, Viktor got lucky. There was heavy shelling and when he realised his captors were no longer guarding him, he ran for his life.
""I calculated that I had more chance of surviving under shelling than if I stayed in that cellar. They'd already put the gun to my head. What would it cost them to pull the trigger?""
From a common grave beneath the children's camp, Volodymyr Boichenko has now been given a proper burial beneath the cherry blossom in the old cemetery of Bucha.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.

The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.
Governor Haidai said Russian forces were blowing up bridges on the river to prevent Ukraine bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians."

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.

""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.

Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.
Read more -Chernobyl scarred by Russian damage and lootingAs the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.

Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.

The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.

""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.
But 100 days on, where might this war go next?
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale presents five potential scenarios - they are not mutually exclusive, but all are within the bounds of plausibility.
Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.
Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.

Since the war in Ukraine began, Russian authorities have clamped down on the country's media. The narrative is set by fiercely pro-war TV stations that have stuck resolutely to the Kremlin's narrative.
At the start of the invasion, these stations refused to call Vladimir Putin's invasion a war.
Now, the strident talk shows that dominate the schedules say repeatedly that Moscow faces World War Three with the West.
Ukraine says the Russian army looted or damaged more than 1,000 computers at the Chernobyl nuclear power station and stole trucks and radiation dosimeters.
But Chernobyl's information director Vitaliy Medved said nuclear equipment was not damaged and ""regarding radiation safety everything is OK"".
In the exclusion zone, however, there are some radiation hotspots which Chernobyl's managers blame on the Russian military activity, as troops dug trenches and their vehicles churned up dust.
Yevhen Kramarenko, head of the exclusion zone agency, said thousands of Russian vehicles including tanks had driven through the zone. He said Russia had based more than 1,000 soldiers at Chernobyl.

Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar.
Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands.
Ukrainian refugees in the UK have been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff.
Wales hope to put 64 years of World Cup hurt behind them as they bid to qualify for their first finals since 1958.
The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people of Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"".
Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November.""
Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time manager Ryan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win.
""They won the Eurovision Song Contest because they had the backing of the world,"" said Page.
""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business.
""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day.""
Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesday to set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country.
""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player.
""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport.
But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country.
""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.""
People in Wales have so far raised millions of pounds for the Ukraine humanitarian fund and, of the 14 million Ukraine people displaced by the conflict, Wales has housed almost 2,000 refugees - with more than 3,300 visas approved.
One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket.
Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off.
""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago.
""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory.""
Rhys, whose first Wales game was their memorable win over Italy in 2002 and whose hero is the late captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta. But these World Cup play-offs are different.
""I came over for the play-off semi-final win over Austria in March and that was amazing. I thought to myself there's no way I'm missing the final.
""It's a tough one to call on Sunday, but I'm pretty confident we can do it and get to Qatar.""
Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was their European Championship play-off against Yugoslavia in 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years.
And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one.
""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff.
""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals.""
Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe.
In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.
Football's first world superstar Pele was the player to break Welsh hearts in Wales' only previous World Cup appearance in 1958.
The then 17-year-old scored the only goal - and his first on the international stage - as eventual tournament winners Brazil beat Wales 1-0 in their quarter final.
The Welsh have got agonisingly close to qualifying on numerous occasions since 1958 - most notably missing out after controversial penalties in 1977 and 1985, both times against Scotland, before Wales themselves squandered a penalty against Romania in 1993.
Wales broke their major finals hoodoo by qualifying for football's European Championships in 2016 where the Welsh reached the semi-final - before reaching the last 16 of Euro 2020.
Sunday's play-off kicks off at 17:00 BST and is for a place in the 2022 Fifa World Cup later this year where the winners will share Group B with England and Iran in Qatar.
A sell-out Cardiff City Stadium crowd hope to cheer them to a first World Cup finals since 1958 and folk singer Dafydd Iwan will perform Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd before kick-off.
Fans going to the game have been warned not to bring in flares because of what the FAW describes as the ""dangers such as loss of sight, limb or digit removal due to their explosive power"".
Football chiefs have warned any fan with a pyrotechnic device risks ""an FA of Wales ban, probable arrest and a minimum three-year football banning order"" - especially after Wales were fined following March's win over Austria.
The Welsh FA are also wary of the growing spate of pitch invasions across the UK following significant matches and have warned any supporters entering the field of play ""will be subject to criminal proceedings"" and Wales could face sanctions from Fifa.
Supporters have been advised to arrive at the ground early because of ""additional security perimeters"" as the FAW warn it may take fans longer than usual gaining access to the venue.
People without tickets have been told by the Football Association of Wales not to travel to the Cardiff City Stadium without a ticket as there is no fan zone or public screening of the game, either outside the ground or in Cardiff city centre.
Supporters heading to Cardiff on Sunday have been told car parking is ""limited"" near the ground, so are warned to plan ahead as public transport companies have said services will be ""very busy"".
Engineering work will affect train services between Cardiff and Bridgend - meaning the last train to Carmarthen will leave Cardiff Central at 22:00 rather than the usual time of 22:25.
Valleys Line services between Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil will be shut for engineering work so buses will replace trains.
Transport for Wales have reminded football fans travelling to north Wales that the only train after the game is the five-hour 21:07 service to Holyhead, changing at Chester.
Roads around the Cardiff City Stadium may be shut two hours before and two hours after the game with Cardiff council warning of closures to Bessemer Road, Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. The length of closures will ""depend on crowds"".
Streets in Cardiff city centre will also be shut in the evening as 10,000 people are expected at the Gerry Cinnamon concert in Cardiff Castle - with road closures after and potentially before gig, depending on crowds.

Mr Macron said it was crucial President Vladimir Putin had a way out of what he called a ""fundamental error"".
But Dmytro Kuleba said allies should ""better focus on how to put Russia in its place"" as it ""humiliates itself"".
Mr Macron has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.
The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin leader contrast with the US and UK positions.
Foreign minister Kuleba said in a tweet that ""calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it"".
Kyiv says Russia must not get territorial concessions from Ukraine, as the Russian invasion has been condemned internationally as brutal aggression.
Earlier, Mr Macron told French regional media that Russia's leader had ""isolated himself"".
""I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,"" he said.
""Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,"" he added.
Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has aligned himself with Mr Macron, suggesting Europe wants ""some credible negotiations"".
The eastern city of Severodonetsk remains the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces fiercely resisting Russian tanks, infantry and intense artillery barrages.
Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk region.
The region's Ukrainian governor Serhiy Haidai said his forces had reclaimed about a fifth of Severodonetsk and could hold on.
""As soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,"" he said.
The US plans to give Kyiv's forces precision rocket systems, so that they can hit Russian positions from a longer range. The UK will also send them a number of large multiple-rocket batteries.
Facing Severodonetsk across the Siverskyi Donets river lies Lysychansk. Both cities are strategically important for Russia: Severodonetsk has the giant Azot chemical plant, which produces nitrogen-based fertilisers, and Lysychansk has Ukraine's second biggest oil refinery.
The fighting has now left most of Severodonetsk in ruins, but thousands of civilians are still sheltering in basements there.

As the 100th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine draws to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the efforts of his military, who he said have rebuffed Moscow's attack.
Mr Zelensky was speaking outside the presidential palace in Kyiv, where he was flanked by key advisors, echoing a video message he posted at the onset of the war.
He said Ukrainian troops have ""done what seemed impossible"" and stopped ""the second army of the world"".
Later, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Telegram that Russia has been ""unable to achieve any strategic goal"" and has instead tried to ""shift its powerlessness to civilian infrastructure and people"".
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hit back, insisting ""certain results have been achieved"" and claiming the ""liberation"" of some regions from what he called the ""pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine"".
Several world leaders used the 100-day mark to praise Ukraine's resistance, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the ""bravery of Ukrainians commands our respect and our admiration"".
Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for on onslaught of 150,000 Russian soldiers in January, the BBC's James Waterhouse reports. .
""It's all a bluff"" and ""we're at war already"" were the most common responses when people were asked whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time.
Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours.
Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance.
Some Russian troops are refusing to return to fight in Ukraine because of their experiences on the front line at the start of the invasion, according to Russian human rights lawyers and activists.
One soldier spent five weeks fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. He told the BBC he didn't want to return to Ukraine to ""kill and be killed"".
He is now home in Russia, having taken legal advice to avoid being sent back to the front line. He is just one of hundreds of Russian soldiers understood to have been seeking such advice.
""I had thought that we were the Russian army, the most super-duper in the world,"" the young man said bitterly. Instead they were expected to operate without even basic equipment, such as night vision devices, he says.
Wars ebb and flow and in enormous mechanised conflicts like Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine it can often be difficult to determine who has gained the upper hand.
Despite early fears of a Ukrainian collapse, Russia's offensive in much of Ukraine stalled and its forces were pushed back from Kyiv. That has now been met by a more focused Russian offensive in the east.

When Vladimir Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian state, he is speaking the familiar language of empire. For five hundred years, European conquerors called the societies that they encountered “tribes,” treating them as incapable of governing themselves. As we see in the ruins of Ukrainian cities, and in the Russian practice of mass killing, rape, and deportation, the claim that a nation does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.Empire’s story divides subjects from objects. As the philosopher Frantz Fanon argued, colonizers see themselves as actors with purpose, and the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn when returning to the Presidency a decade ago. In 2012, he described Russia as a “state-civilization,” which by its nature absorbed smaller cultures such as Ukraine’s. The next year, he claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were joined in “spiritual unity.” In a long essay on “historical unity,” published last July, he argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single country, bound by a shared origin. His vision is of a broken world that must be restored through violence. Russia becomes itself only by annihilating Ukraine.
As the objects of this rhetoric, and of the war of destruction that it sanctions, Ukrainians grasp all of this. Ukraine does have a history, of course, and Ukrainians do constitute a nation. But empire enforces objectification on the periphery and amnesia at the center. Thus modern Russian imperialism includes memory laws that forbid serious discussion of the Soviet past. It is illegal for Russians to apply the word “war” to the invasion of Ukraine. It is also illegal to say that Stalin began the Second World War as Hitler’s ally, and used much the same justification to attack Poland as Putin is using to attack Ukraine. When the invasion began, in February, Russian publishers were ordered to purge mentions of Ukraine from textbooks.
Faced with the Kremlin’s official mixture of fantasy and taboo, the temptation is to prove the opposite: that it is Ukraine rather than Russia that is eternal, that it is Ukrainians, not Russians, who are always right, and so on. Yet Ukrainian history gives us something more interesting than a mere counter-narrative to empire. We can find Ukrainian national feeling at a very early date. In contemporary Ukraine, though, the nation is not so much anti-colonial, a rejection of a particular imperial power, as post-colonial, the creation of something new.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
The city of Kyiv did not exist in ancient times, but it is very old—about half a millennium older than Moscow. It was probably founded in the sixth or seventh century, north of any territory seen by Greeks or controlled by Romans. Islam was advancing, and Christianity was becoming European. The Western Roman Empire had fallen, leaving a form of Christianity subordinate to a pope. The Eastern (Byzantine) Empire remained, directing what we now call the Orthodox Church. As Rome and Constantinople competed for converts, peoples east of Kyiv converted to Islam. Kyivans spoke a Slavic language that had no writing system, and practiced a paganism without idols or temples.
Putin’s vision of “unity” relates to a baptism that took place in this setting. In the ninth century, a group of Vikings known as the Rus arrived in Kyiv. Seeking a southbound route for their slave trade, they found the Dnipro River, which runs through the city. Their chieftains then fought over a patchwork of territories in what is now Ukraine, Belarus, and the northeast of Russia—with Kyiv always as the prize. In the late tenth century, a Viking named Valdemar took the city, with the help of a Scandinavian army. He initially governed as a pagan. But, around 987, when the Byzantines faced an internal revolt, he sensed an opportunity. He came to the emperor’s aid, and received his sister’s hand in marriage. In the process, Valdemar converted to Christianity.
Putin claims that this messy sequence of events reveals the will of God to bind Russia and Ukraine forever. The will of God is easy to misunderstand; in any case, modern nations did not exist at the time, and the words “Russia” and “Ukraine” had no meaning. Valdemar was typical of the pagan Eastern European rulers of his day, considering multiple monotheistic options before choosing the one that made the most strategic sense. The word “Rus” no longer meant Viking slavers but a Christian polity. Its ruling family now intermarried with others, and the local people were treated as subjects to be taxed rather than as bodies to be sold.
Yet no rule defined who would take power after a Kyivan ruler’s death. Valdemar took a Byzantine princess as his wife, but he had a half a dozen others, not to mention a harem of hundreds of women. When he died in 1015, he had imprisoned one of his sons, Sviatopolk, and was making war upon another, Yaroslav. Sviatopolk was freed after his father’s death, and killed three of his brothers, but he was defeated on the battlefield by Yaroslav. Other sons entered the fray, and Yaroslav didn’t rule alone until 1036. The succession had taken twenty-one years. At least ten other sons of Valdemar had died in the meantime.
These events do not reveal a timeless empire, as Putin claims. But they do suggest the importance of a succession principle, a theme very important in Ukrainian-Russian relations today. The Ukrainian transliteration of “Valdemar” is “Volodymyr,” the name of Ukraine’s President. In Ukraine, power is transferred through democratic elections: when Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 Presidential election, the sitting President accepted defeat. The Russian transliteration of the same name is “Vladimir.” Russia is brittle: it has no succession principle, and it’s unclear what will happen when Vladimir Putin dies or is forced from power. The pressure of mortality confirms the imperial thinking. An aging tyrant, obsessed by his legacy, seizes upon a lofty illusion that seems to confer immortality: the “unity” of Russia and Ukraine.

In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
This was a crucial change. After 1569, Kyiv was no longer a source of law but an object of it—the archetypal colonial situation. It was colonization that set off Ukraine from the former territories of Rus, and its manner generated qualities still visible today: suspicion of the central state, organization in crisis, and the notion of freedom as self-expression, despite a powerful neighbor.
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, all the forces of Europe’s globalization seemed to bear down on Ukraine. Polish colonization resembled and in some measure enabled the European colonization of the wider world. Polish nobles introduced land-management practices—along with land managers, most of whom were Jewish—that allowed the establishment of profitable plantations. Local Ukrainian warlords rushed to imitate the system, and adopted elements of Polish culture, including Western Christianity and the Polish language. In an age of discovery, enserfed peasants labored for a world market.
Ukraine’s colonization coincided with the Renaissance, and with a spectacular flowering of Polish culture. Like other Renaissance thinkers, Polish scholars in Ukraine resuscitated ancient knowledge, and sometimes overturned it. It was a Pole, Copernicus, who undid the legacy of Ptolemy’s “Almagest” and confirmed that the Earth orbits the sun. It was another Pole, Maciej of Miechów, who corrected Ptolemy’s “Geography,” clearing Ukrainian maps of gold and ambrosia. As in ancient times, however, the tilling of the black earth enabled tremendous wealth, raising the question of why those who labored and those who profited experienced such different fates.
The Renaissance considered questions of identity through language. Across Europe, there was a debate as to whether Latin, now revived, was sufficient for the culture, or whether vernacular spoken languages should be elevated for the task. In the early fourteenth century, Dante answered this question in favor of Italian; English, French, Spanish, and Polish writers created other literary languages by codifying local vernaculars. In Ukraine, literary Polish emerged victorious over the Ukrainian vernacular, becoming the language of the commercial and intellectual élite. In a way, this was typical: Polish was a modern language, like English or Italian. But it was not the local language in Ukraine. Ukraine’s answer to the language question was deeply colonial, whereas in the rest of Europe it could be seen as broadly democratic.
The Reformation brought a similar result: local élites converted to Protestantism and then to Roman Catholicism, alienating them further from an Orthodox population. The convergence of colonization, the Renaissance, and the Reformation was specific to Ukraine. By the sixteen-forties, the few large landholders generally spoke Polish and were Catholic, and those who worked for them spoke Ukrainian and were Orthodox. Globalization had generated differences and inequalities that pushed the people to rebellion.
Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
The rebellion began in 1648, when an influential Cossack, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, saw his lands seized and his son attacked by a Polish noble. Finding himself beyond the protection of the law, Khmelnytsky turned his fellow-Cossacks toward revolt against the Polish-speaking, Roman Catholic magnates who dominated Ukraine. The accumulated cultural, religious, and economic grievances of the people quickly transformed the revolt into something very much like an anti-colonial uprising, with violence directed not only against the private armies of the magnates but against Poles and Jews generally. The magnates carried out reprisals against peasants and Cossacks, impaling them on stakes. The Polish-Lithuanian cavalry fought what had been their own Cossack infantry. Each side knew the other very well.
In 1651, the Cossacks, realizing that they needed help, turned to an Eastern power, Muscovy, about which they knew little. When Kyivan Rus had collapsed, most of its lands had been absorbed by Lithuania, but some of its northeastern territories remained under the dominion of a Mongol successor state. There, in a new city called Moscow, leaders known as tsars had begun an extraordinary period of territorial expansion, extending their realm into northern Asia. In 1648, the year that the Cossack uprising began, a Muscovite explorer reached the Pacific Ocean.
The war in Ukraine allowed Muscovy to turn its attention to Europe. In 1654, the Cossacks signed an agreement with representatives of the tsar. The Muscovite armies invaded Poland-Lithuania from the east; soon after, Sweden invaded from the north, setting off the crisis that Polish history remembers as “the Deluge.” Peace was eventually made between Poland-Lithuania and Muscovy, in 1667, and Ukraine was divided more or less down the middle, along the Dnipro. After a thousand years of existence, Kyiv was politically connected to Moscow for the first time.
The Cossacks were something like an early national movement. The problem was that their struggle against one colonial power enabled another. In 1721, Muscovy was renamed the Russian Empire, in reference to old Rus. Poland-Lithuania never really recovered from the Deluge, and was partitioned out of existence between 1772 and 1795. Russia thereby claimed the rest of Ukraine—everything but a western district known as Galicia, which went to the Habsburgs. Around the same time, in 1775, the Cossacks lost their status. They did not gain the political rights they had wanted, nor did the peasants who supported them gain control of the black earth. Polish landowners remained in Ukraine, even as state power became Russian.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The nineteenth century was the age of national revivals. When the Ukrainian movement began in imperial Russian Kharkov—today Kharkiv, and largely in ruins—the focus was on the Cossack legacy. The next move was to locate history in the people, as an account of continuous culture. At first, such efforts did not seem threatening to imperial rule. But, after the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, in 1856, and the insult of the Polish uprising of 1863 and 1864, Ukrainian culture was declared not to exist. It was often deemed an invention of Polish élites—an idea that Putin endorsed in his essay on “historical unity.” Leading Ukrainian thinkers emigrated to Galicia, where they could speak freely.
The First World War brought the principle of self-determination, which promised a release from imperial rule. In practice, it was often used to rescue old empires, or to build new ones. A Ukrainian National Republic was established in 1917, as the Russian Empire collapsed into revolution. In 1918, in return for a promise of foodstuffs, the country was recognized by Austria and Germany. Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination, but his victorious entente ignored Ukraine, recognizing Polish claims instead. Vladimir Lenin invoked the principle as well, though he meant only that the exploitation of national questions could advance class revolution. Ukraine soon found itself at the center of the Russian civil war, in which the Red Army, led by the Bolsheviks, and the White Army, fighting for the defunct empire, both denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty. In this dreadful conflict, which followed four years of war, millions of people died, among them tens of thousands of Jews.
Though the Red Army ultimately prevailed, Bolshevik leaders knew that the Ukrainian question had to be addressed. Putin claims that the Bolsheviks created Ukraine, but the truth is close to the opposite. The Bolsheviks destroyed the Ukrainian National Republic. Aware that Ukrainian identity was real and widespread, they designed their new state to account for it. It was largely thanks to Ukraine that the Soviet Union took the form it did, as a federation of units with national names.
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
Stalin spoke of an internal colonization, in which peasants would be exploited so that the Soviet economy could imitate—and then overtake—capitalism. His policy of collective agriculture, in which land was seized from farmers, was particularly unwelcome in Ukraine, where the revolution had finally got rid of the (still largely Polish) landholders. Yet the black earth of Ukraine was central to Stalin’s plans, and he moved to subdue it. In 1932 and 1933, he enforced a series of policies that led to around four million people dying of hunger or related disease. Soviet propaganda blamed the Ukrainians, claiming that they were killing themselves to discredit Soviet rule—a tactic echoed, today, by Putin. Europeans who tried to organize famine relief were dismissed as Nazis.
The actual Nazis saw Stalin’s famine as a sign that Ukrainian agriculture could be exploited for another imperial project: their own. Hitler wanted Soviet power overthrown, Soviet cities depopulated, and the whole western part of the country colonized. His vision of Ukrainians was intensely colonial: he imagined that he could deport and starve them by the millions, and exploit the labor of whoever remained. It was Hitler’s desire for Ukrainian land that brought millions of Jews under German control. In this sense, colonial logic about Ukraine was a necessary condition for the Holocaust.
Between 1933 and 1945, Soviet and Nazi colonialism made Ukraine the most dangerous place in the world. More civilians were killed in Ukraine, in acts of atrocity, than anywhere else. That reckoning doesn’t even include soldiers: more Ukrainians died fighting the Germans, in the Second World War, than French, American, and British troops combined.
The major conflict of the war in Europe was the German-Soviet struggle for Ukraine, which took place between 1941 and 1945. But, when the war began, in 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany were de-facto allies, and jointly invaded Poland. At the time, what is now western Ukraine was southeastern Poland. A small group of Ukrainian nationalists there joined the Germans, understanding that they would seek to destroy the U.S.S.R. When it became clear that the Germans would fail, the nationalists left their service, ethnically cleansed Poles in 1943 and 1944, and then resisted the Soviets. In Putin’s texts, they figure as timeless villains, responsible for Ukrainian difference generally. The irony, of course, is that they emerged thanks to Stalin’s much grander collaboration with Hitler. They were crushed by Soviet power, in a brutal counter-insurgency, and today Ukraine’s far right polls at one to two per cent. Meanwhile, the Poles, whose ancestors were the chief victims of Ukrainian nationalism, have admitted nearly three million Ukrainian refugees, reminding us that there are other ways to handle history than stories of eternal victimhood.
After the war, western Ukraine was added to Soviet Ukraine, and the republic was placed under suspicion precisely because it had been under German occupation. New restrictions on Ukrainian culture were justified by a manufactured allocation of guilt. This circular logic—we punish you, therefore you must be guilty—informs Kremlin propaganda today. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has argued that Russia had to invade Ukraine because Ukraine might have started a war. Putin, who has said the same, is clearly drawing on Stalin’s rhetoric. We are to understand that the Soviet victory in the Second World War left Russians forever pure and Ukrainians eternally guilty. At the funerals of Russian soldiers, grieving parents are told that their sons were fighting Nazis.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.
Ukrainian national rhetoric is less coherent than Putin’s imperialism, and, therefore, more credible, and more human. Independence arrived in 1991, when the U.S.S.R was dissolved. Since then, the country’s politics have been marked by corruption and inequality, but also by a democratic spirit that has grown in tandem with national self-awareness. In 2004, an attempt to rig an election was defeated by a mass movement. In 2014, millions of Ukrainians protested a President who retreated from the E.U. The protesters were massacred, the President fled, and Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time. Again and again, Ukrainians have elected Presidents who seek reconciliation with Russia; again and again, this has failed. Zelensky is an extreme case: he ran on a platform of peace, only to be greeted with an invasion.
Ukraine is a post-colonial country, one that does not define itself against exploitation so much as accept, and sometimes even celebrate, the complications of emerging from it. Its people are bilingual, and its soldiers speak the language of the invader as well as their own. The war is fought in a decentralized way, dependent on the solidarity of local communities. These communities are diverse, but together they defend the notion of Ukraine as a political nation. There is something heartening in this. The model of the nation as a mini-empire, replicating inequalities on a smaller scale, and aiming for a homogeneity that is confused with identity, has worn itself out. If we are going to have democratic states in the twenty-first century, they will have to accept some of the complexity that is taken for granted in Ukraine.
The contrast between an aging empire and a new kind of nation is captured by Zelensky, whose simple presence makes Kremlin ideology seem senseless. Born in 1978, he is a child of the U.S.S.R., and speaks Russian with his family. A Jew, he reminds us that democracy can be multicultural. He does not so much answer Russian imperialism as exist alongside it, as though hailing from some wiser dimension. He does not need to mirror Putin; he just needs to show up. Every day, he affirms his nation by what he says and what he does.
Ukrainians assert their nation’s existence through simple acts of solidarity. They are not resisting Russia because of some absence or some difference, because they are not Russians or opposed to Russians. What is to be resisted is elemental: the threat of national extinction represented by Russian colonialism, a war of destruction expressly designed to resolve “the Ukrainian question.” Ukrainians know that there is not a question to be answered, only a life to be lived and, if need be, to be risked. They resist because they know who they are. In one of his very first videos after the invasion, when Russian propaganda claimed that he had fled Kyiv, Zelensky pointed the camera at himself and said, “The President is here.” That is it. Ukraine is here.When Vladimir Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian state, he is speaking the familiar language of empire. For five hundred years, European conquerors called the societies that they encountered “tribes,” treating them as incapable of governing themselves. As we see in the ruins of Ukrainian cities, and in the Russian practice of mass killing, rape, and deportation, the claim that a nation does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it.
Empire’s story divides subjects from objects. As the philosopher Frantz Fanon argued, colonizers see themselves as actors with purpose, and the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn when returning to the Presidency a decade ago. In 2012, he described Russia as a “state-civilization,” which by its nature absorbed smaller cultures such as Ukraine’s. The next year, he claimed that Russians and Ukrainians were joined in “spiritual unity.” In a long essay on “historical unity,” published last July, he argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single country, bound by a shared origin. His vision is of a broken world that must be restored through violence. Russia becomes itself only by annihilating Ukraine.
As the objects of this rhetoric, and of the war of destruction that it sanctions, Ukrainians grasp all of this. Ukraine does have a history, of course, and Ukrainians do constitute a nation. But empire enforces objectification on the periphery and amnesia at the center. Thus modern Russian imperialism includes memory laws that forbid serious discussion of the Soviet past. It is illegal for Russians to apply the word “war” to the invasion of Ukraine. It is also illegal to say that Stalin began the Second World War as Hitler’s ally, and used much the same justification to attack Poland as Putin is using to attack Ukraine. When the invasion began, in February, Russian publishers were ordered to purge mentions of Ukraine from textbooks.
Faced with the Kremlin’s official mixture of fantasy and taboo, the temptation is to prove the opposite: that it is Ukraine rather than Russia that is eternal, that it is Ukrainians, not Russians, who are always right, and so on. Yet Ukrainian history gives us something more interesting than a mere counter-narrative to empire. We can find Ukrainian national feeling at a very early date. In contemporary Ukraine, though, the nation is not so much anti-colonial, a rejection of a particular imperial power, as post-colonial, the creation of something new.
Southern Ukraine, where Russian troops are now besieging cities and bombing hospitals, was well known to the ancients. In the founding myth of Athens, the goddess Athena gives the city the gift of the olive tree. In fact, the city could grow olives only because it imported grain from ports on the Black Sea coast. The Greeks knew the coast, but not the hinterland, where they imagined mythical creatures guarding fields of gold and ambrosia. Here already was a colonial view of Ukraine: a land of fantasy, where those who take have the right to dream.
The city of Kyiv did not exist in ancient times, but it is very old—about half a millennium older than Moscow. It was probably founded in the sixth or seventh century, north of any territory seen by Greeks or controlled by Romans. Islam was advancing, and Christianity was becoming European. The Western Roman Empire had fallen, leaving a form of Christianity subordinate to a pope. The Eastern (Byzantine) Empire remained, directing what we now call the Orthodox Church. As Rome and Constantinople competed for converts, peoples east of Kyiv converted to Islam. Kyivans spoke a Slavic language that had no writing system, and practiced a paganism without idols or temples.
Putin’s vision of “unity” relates to a baptism that took place in this setting. In the ninth century, a group of Vikings known as the Rus arrived in Kyiv. Seeking a southbound route for their slave trade, they found the Dnipro River, which runs through the city. Their chieftains then fought over a patchwork of territories in what is now Ukraine, Belarus, and the northeast of Russia—with Kyiv always as the prize. In the late tenth century, a Viking named Valdemar took the city, with the help of a Scandinavian army. He initially governed as a pagan. But, around 987, when the Byzantines faced an internal revolt, he sensed an opportunity. He came to the emperor’s aid, and received his sister’s hand in marriage. In the process, Valdemar converted to Christianity.
Putin claims that this messy sequence of events reveals the will of God to bind Russia and Ukraine forever. The will of God is easy to misunderstand; in any case, modern nations did not exist at the time, and the words “Russia” and “Ukraine” had no meaning. Valdemar was typical of the pagan Eastern European rulers of his day, considering multiple monotheistic options before choosing the one that made the most strategic sense. The word “Rus” no longer meant Viking slavers but a Christian polity.

Yet no rule defined who would take power after a Kyivan ruler’s death. Valdemar took a Byzantine princess as his wife, but he had a half a dozen others, not to mention a harem of hundreds of women. When he died in 1015, he had imprisoned one of his sons, Sviatopolk, and was making war upon another, Yaroslav. Sviatopolk was freed after his father’s death, and killed three of his brothers, but he was defeated on the battlefield by Yaroslav. Other sons entered the fray, and Yaroslav didn’t rule alone until 1036. The succession had taken twenty-one years. At least ten other sons of Valdemar had died in the meantime.
These events do not reveal a timeless empire, as Putin claims. But they do suggest the importance of a succession principle, a theme very important in Ukrainian-Russian relations today.

In the Icelandic sagas, Yaroslav is remembered as the Lame; in Eastern Europe, he is the Wise, the giver of laws. Yet he did not solve the problem of succession. Following his reign, the lands around Kyiv fragmented again and again. In 1240, the city fell to the Mongols; later, most of old Rus was claimed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Lithuania borrowed from Kyiv a grammar of politics, as well as a good deal of law. For a couple of centuries, its grand dukes also ruled Poland. But, in 1569, after the Lithuanian dynasty died out, a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was formalized, and the territories of Ukraine were placed under Polish jurisdiction.
This was a crucial change. After 1569, Kyiv was no longer a source of law but an object of it—the archetypal colonial situation. It was colonization that set off Ukraine from the former territories of Rus, and its manner generated qualities still visible today: suspicion of the central state, organization in crisis, and the notion of freedom as self-expression, despite a powerful neighbor.

Ukrainians on the battlefield today rely on no fantasy of the past to counter Putin’s. If there is a precursor that matters to them, it is the Cossacks, a group of free people who lived on the far reaches of the Ukrainian steppe, making their fortress on an island in the middle of the Dnipro. Having escaped the Polish system of landowners and peasants, they could choose to be “registered Cossacks,” paid for their service in the Polish Army. Still, they were not citizens, and more of them wished to be registered than the Polish-Lithuanian parliament would allow.
The rebellion began in 1648, when an influential Cossack, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, saw his lands seized and his son attacked by a Polish noble. Finding himself beyond the protection of the law, Khmelnytsky turned his fellow-Cossacks toward revolt against the Polish-speaking, Roman Catholic magnates who dominated Ukraine. The accumulated cultural, religious, and economic grievances of the people quickly transformed the revolt into something very much like an anti-colonial uprising, with violence directed not only against the private armies of the magnates but against Poles and Jews generally. The magnates carried out reprisals against peasants and Cossacks, impaling them on stakes. The Polish-Lithuanian cavalry fought what had been their own Cossack infantry. Each side knew the other very well.
In 1651, the Cossacks, realizing that they needed help, turned to an Eastern power, Muscovy, about which they knew little. When Kyivan Rus had collapsed, most of its lands had been absorbed by Lithuania, but some of its northeastern territories remained under the dominion of a Mongol successor state. There, in a new city called Moscow, leaders known as tsars had begun an extraordinary period of territorial expansion, extending their realm into northern Asia. In 1648, the year that the Cossack uprising began, a Muscovite explorer reached the Pacific Ocean.
The war in Ukraine allowed Muscovy to turn its attention to Europe. In 1654, the Cossacks signed an agreement with representatives of the tsar. The Muscovite armies invaded Poland-Lithuania from the east; soon after, Sweden invaded from the north, setting off the crisis that Polish history remembers as “the Deluge.” Peace was eventually made between Poland-Lithuania and Muscovy, in 1667, and Ukraine was divided more or less down the middle, along the Dnipro. After a thousand years of existence, Kyiv was politically connected to Moscow for the first time.
The Cossacks were something like an early national movement. The problem was that their struggle against one colonial power enabled another. In 1721, Muscovy was renamed the Russian Empire, in reference to old Rus. Poland-Lithuania never really recovered from the Deluge, and was partitioned out of existence between 1772 and 1795. Russia thereby claimed the rest of Ukraine—everything but a western district known as Galicia, which went to the Habsburgs. Around the same time, in 1775, the Cossacks lost their status. They did not gain the political rights they had wanted, nor did the peasants who supported them gain control of the black earth. Polish landowners remained in Ukraine, even as state power became Russian.
Whereas Putin’s story of Ukraine is about destiny, the Ukrainian recollection of the Cossacks is about unfulfilled aspirations. The country’s national anthem, written in 1862, speaks of a young people upon whom fate has yet to smile, but who will one day prove worthy of the “Cossack nation.”
The nineteenth century was the age of national revivals. When the Ukrainian movement began in imperial Russian Kharkov—today Kharkiv, and largely in ruins—the focus was on the Cossack legacy. The next move was to locate history in the people, as an account of continuous culture. At first, such efforts did not seem threatening to imperial rule. But, after the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, in 1856, and the insult of the Polish uprising of 1863 and 1864, Ukrainian culture was declared not to exist. It was often deemed an invention of Polish élites—an idea that Putin endorsed in his essay on “historical unity.” Leading Ukrainian thinkers emigrated to Galicia, where they could speak freely.
The First World War brought the principle of self-determination, which promised a release from imperial rule. In practice, it was often used to rescue old empires, or to build new ones. A Ukrainian National Republic was established in 1917, as the Russian Empire collapsed into revolution. In 1918, in return for a promise of foodstuffs, the country was recognized by Austria and Germany. Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination, but his victorious entente ignored Ukraine, recognizing Polish claims instead. Vladimir Lenin invoked the principle as well, though he meant only that the exploitation of national questions could advance class revolution. Ukraine soon found itself at the center of the Russian civil war, in which the Red Army, led by the Bolsheviks, and the White Army, fighting for the defunct empire, both denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty. In this dreadful conflict, which followed four years of war, millions of people died, among them tens of thousands of Jews.
Though the Red Army ultimately prevailed, Bolshevik leaders knew that the Ukrainian question had to be addressed. Putin claims that the Bolsheviks created Ukraine, but the truth is close to the opposite. The Bolsheviks destroyed the Ukrainian National Republic. Aware that Ukrainian identity was real and widespread, they designed their new state to account for it. It was largely thanks to Ukraine that the Soviet Union took the form it did, as a federation of units with national names.
The failure of self-determination in Ukraine was hardly unique. Almost all of the new states created after the First World War were destroyed, within about two decades, by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or both. In the political imaginations of both regimes, Ukraine was the territory whose possession would allow them to break the postwar order, and to transform the world in their own image. As in the sixteenth century, it was as if all the forces of world history were concentrated on a single country.
Stalin spoke of an internal colonization, in which peasants would be exploited so that the Soviet economy could imitate—and then overtake—capitalism. His policy of collective agriculture, in which land was seized from farmers, was particularly unwelcome in Ukraine, where the revolution had finally got rid of the (still largely Polish) landholders. Yet the black earth of Ukraine was central to Stalin’s plans, and he moved to subdue it. In 1932 and 1933, he enforced a series of policies that led to around four million people dying of hunger or related disease. Soviet propaganda blamed the Ukrainians, claiming that they were killing themselves to discredit Soviet rule—a tactic echoed, today, by Putin. Europeans who tried to organize famine relief were dismissed as Nazis.
The actual Nazis saw Stalin’s famine as a sign that Ukrainian agriculture could be exploited for another imperial project: their own. Hitler wanted Soviet power overthrown, Soviet cities depopulated, and the whole western part of the country colonized. His vision of Ukrainians was intensely colonial: he imagined that he could deport and starve them by the millions, and exploit the labor of whoever remained. It was Hitler’s desire for Ukrainian land that brought millions of Jews under German control. In this sense, colonial logic about Ukraine was a necessary condition for the Holocaust.
Between 1933 and 1945, Soviet and Nazi colonialism made Ukraine the most dangerous place in the world. More civilians were killed in Ukraine, in acts of atrocity, than anywhere else. That reckoning doesn’t even include soldiers: more Ukrainians died fighting the Germans, in the Second World War, than French, American, and British troops combined.
The major conflict of the war in Europe was the German-Soviet struggle for Ukraine, which took place between 1941 and 1945. But, when the war began, in 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany were de-facto allies, and jointly invaded Poland. At the time, what is now western Ukraine was southeastern Poland. A small group of Ukrainian nationalists there joined the Germans, understanding that they would seek to destroy the U.S.S.R. When it became clear that the Germans would fail, the nationalists left their service, ethnically cleansed Poles in 1943 and 1944, and then resisted the Soviets. In Putin’s texts, they figure as timeless villains, responsible for Ukrainian difference generally. The irony, of course, is that they emerged thanks to Stalin’s much grander collaboration with Hitler. They were crushed by Soviet power, in a brutal counter-insurgency, and today Ukraine’s far right polls at one to two per cent. Meanwhile, the Poles, whose ancestors were the chief victims of Ukrainian nationalism, have admitted nearly three million Ukrainian refugees, reminding us that there are other ways to handle history than stories of eternal victimhood.
After the war, western Ukraine was added to Soviet Ukraine, and the republic was placed under suspicion precisely because it had been under German occupation. New restrictions on Ukrainian culture were justified by a manufactured allocation of guilt. This circular logic—we punish you, therefore you must be guilty—informs Kremlin propaganda today. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has argued that Russia had to invade Ukraine because Ukraine might have started a war. Putin, who has said the same, is clearly drawing on Stalin’s rhetoric. We are to understand that the Soviet victory in the Second World War left Russians forever pure and Ukrainians eternally guilty. At the funerals of Russian soldiers, grieving parents are told that their sons were fighting Nazis.
The history of the colonization of Ukraine, like the history of troubling and divisive subjects in general, can help us get free of myths. The past delivers to Putin several strands of colonial rhetoric, which he has combined and intensified. It also leaves us vulnerable to a language of exploitation: whenever we speak of “the Ukraine” instead of “Ukraine,” or pronounce the capital city in the Russian style, or act as if Americans can tell Ukrainians when and how to make peace, we are continuing imperial rhetoric by partaking in it.
Ukrainian national rhetoric is less coherent than Putin’s imperialism, and, therefore, more credible, and more human. Independence arrived in 1991, when the U.S.S.R was dissolved. Since then, the country’s politics have been marked by corruption and inequality, but also by a democratic spirit that has grown in tandem with national self-awareness. In 2004, an attempt to rig an election was defeated by a mass movement. In 2014, millions of Ukrainians protested a President who retreated from the E.U. The protesters were massacred, the President fled, and Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time. Again and again, Ukrainians have elected Presidents who seek reconciliation with Russia; again and again, this has failed. Zelensky is an extreme case: he ran on a platform of peace, only to be greeted with an invasion.
Ukraine is a post-colonial country, one that does not define itself against exploitation so much as accept, and sometimes even celebrate, the complications of emerging from it. Its people are bilingual, and its soldiers speak the language of the invader as well as their own. The war is fought in a decentralized way, dependent on the solidarity of local communities. These communities are diverse, but together they defend the notion of Ukraine as a political nation. There is something heartening in this. The model of the nation as a mini-empire, replicating inequalities on a smaller scale, and aiming for a homogeneity that is confused with identity, has worn itself out. If we are going to have democratic states in the twenty-first century, they will have to accept some of the complexity that is taken for granted in Ukraine.
The contrast between an aging empire and a new kind of nation is captured by Zelensky, whose simple presence makes Kremlin ideology seem senseless. Born in 1978, he is a child of the U.S.S.R., and speaks Russian with his family. A Jew, he reminds us that democracy can be multicultural. He does not so much answer Russian imperialism as exist alongside it, as though hailing from some wiser dimension. He does not need to mirror Putin; he just needs to show up. Every day, he affirms his nation by what he says and what he does.
Ukrainians assert their nation’s existence through simple acts of solidarity. They are not resisting Russia because of some absence or some difference, because they are not Russians or opposed to Russians. What is to be resisted is elemental: the threat of national extinction represented by Russian colonialism, a war of destruction expressly designed to resolve “the Ukrainian question.” Ukrainians know that there is not a question to be answered, only a life to be lived and, if need be, to be risked. They resist because they know who they are. In one of his very first videos after the invasion, when Russian propaganda claimed that he had fled Kyiv, Zelensky pointed the camera at himself and said, “The President is here.” That is it. Ukraine is here."

Over the weekend, a story came out of Brussels that many may have missed. The twenty-seven member states of the European Union reached an agreement on a new law requiring big online platforms, including social-media companies, to police hate speech and disinformation more effectively. Under the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, European governments now have the power to ask Web platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to remove any content that promotes terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse, or commercial scams. The platforms will also be obliged to prevent the “manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security.”“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.
Ironically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.
Evidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.

In a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets  and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could  clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.
But none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?
Based on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”
Based on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month.  If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.
Musk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting  misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.
In a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.
Regulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”
Musk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.Over the weekend, a story came out of Brussels that many may have missed.

New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/werner-herzog-has-never-liked-introspection;2022-04-26;Werner Herzog Has Never Liked Introspection;"A conversation with the filmmaker about the place of literature, the toll of war, and the conviction that his writing will outlast his movies.
When I first corresponded with the filmmaker Werner Herzog, in January, 2021, he told me that lockdown reminded him of Boccaccio’s Decameron. As he put it: “Go into isolation in the countryside and let the storytelling begin.” During quarantine, he finished two films: a documentary called “The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft,” about a pair of French volcanologists; and another, “Theater of Thought,” about neurotechnology and artificial intelligence. Both are forthcoming.He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue.When I first corresponded with the filmmaker Werner Herzog, in January, 2021, he told me that lockdown reminded him of Boccaccio’s Decameron. As he put it: “Go into isolation in the countryside and let the storytelling begin.” During quarantine, he finished two films: a documentary called “The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft,” about a pair of French volcanologists; and another, “Theater of Thought,” about neurotechnology and artificial intelligence. Both are forthcoming.
He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue."
New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/the-ordinary-americans-resettling-migrants-fleeing-war;2022-04-25;The Ordinary Americans Resettling Migrants Fleeing War;"After Trump eviscerated the refugee-resettlement system, the government was unprepared for the large numbers of Afghans displaced by their country’s collapse. A new program lets civilians step up to help.
On the morning of August 15th, Halima, a twenty-two-year-old engineering student at the Afghan National Defense University, was sitting in her dorm room and studying for a final exam when she heard some girls screaming in the hallway. Taliban fighters had just arrived in Kabul, after the withdrawal of American troops, and were taking over the city. Halima, who is quiet, with delicate features, had grown up in a rural village in southern Afghanistan, where her father taught science at a girls’ school. Like many other young women who joined the Afghan military, she was Hazara, an ethnic and religious minority that has long been persecuted in Afghanistan, including by the Taliban.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option. Terrie Shannon, a seventy-eight-year-old retired education professor, agreed to lead the circle. “I said yes partly in defiance of the people in this county who supported Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants,” she told me. None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
The women weren’t allowed to work until their paperwork was sorted out, so they spent their days padding around the retreat center in slippers crocheted by the sisters. The women began calling Shannon “Grandmother.” One afternoon, Halima invited her over to speak with her mother on FaceTime, and both older women started to cry. “I swore a sacred promise to her that I would take care of her daughter,” Shannon told me. The young women were polite and quick to smile, but any mention of life at home made them grow grim. They worried about the women they had left behind. “We want so badly for them to find a way out, too,” Akbari said. They wanted to send the pocket money they received from the Sponsor Circle—fifteen dollars a week—home to their relatives, some of whom were near starvation owing to an ongoing famine. But the volunteers worried that too much financial support would muddy the scope of their commitment to the women. Frantz, who had adopted a son from Guatemala and had experience with the complexity of distant entanglements, said, “We could set up a dependency we really can’t sustain.” In the end, though, the volunteers helped Haidari wire money home to her father, who was sick.
Frustrations mounted. For Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari, life as a high-ranking student or professional was over. “We really don’t fit in here yet, and we don’t know the language,” Akbari said. The women had been given donated computers that were nearly useless. They needed to apply for public assistance, but the system was byzantine. They had entered the country on “humanitarian parole,” which, unlike refugee status, did not guarantee that, among other things, they could stay indefinitely, and meant that they still needed to apply for asylum. But many private immigration lawyers were overwhelmed and increasingly expensive. “They are charging exorbitant rates to the most vulnerable people,” Frantz said.
Still, the women found fun where they could. They went clothes shopping, and, after months of washing their hair with dish soap in the safe houses, they each chose their own shampoo. They went to a potluck dinner at the only mosque in northeastern Minnesota. They baked bread and sang songs with the sisters. They played volleyball in the driveway and tried out snowshoeing. One weekend, members of the Sponsor Circle offered to take the four women on a church snow-tubing trip. The night before, however, when a volunteer read them the waivers that they’d need to sign, the women decided not to go. Why, after risking their lives to escape Afghanistan, would they volunteer to do something that might break their legs? “We thought it must be something very dangerous,” Khalili told me.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”
One of the most critical factors in the successful integration of immigrants is their ability to find a community, and Sponsor Circles help to create local bonds. “It’s proven to make a difference in whether or not refugees succeed,” David Miliband, the president and C.E.O. of the International Rescue Committee, told me. Maniatis, from the Open Society Foundations, told me that he hopes that involving Americans directly in resettlement efforts will help to combat anti-immigrant sentiment: “This is infrastructure that engages a community in social issues and places people at the center of the solution.” Following the success of the Sponsor Circle program, the Biden Administration has decided to launch a larger sponsorship program, which will be implemented later this year. The Administration recently committed to welcoming a hundred thousand refugees from Ukraine, and some of them will be resettled through the new sponsorship program. “The Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans has shown that everyday Americans and community groups across the country are willing and able to step up in extraordinary ways,” a State Department spokesperson told me. “The experience to date demonstrates the powerful and impactful role that Americans from all walks of life can play as they seek to welcome Afghans and now Ukrainians arriving in their communities.”
But Sponsor Circles also face challenges. The program requires that volunteers raise at least two thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars per newcomer, and pledge to help out for a minimum of three months. “It’s nowhere near enough,” Embry Howell, a health-policy expert and a member of a Sponsor Circle in the D.C. area, told me. Sponsor Circles also lack the experience of government agencies, including knowledge about how to access social workers and how to navigate the labyrinthine systems that govern Social Security and other benefits. Howell told me that one woman she works with experiences severe anxiety when using the elevator in their building—which makes it difficult for her to leave the house. “She doesn’t speak English, all of her family is in Afghanistan, and mental health is really the missing piece.”
In Duluth, Halima and the others soon found work in the kitchen of an assisted-living and health-care center associated with the Benedictine sisters. The jobs paid only thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents an hour, but they came with a signing bonus of five hundred dollars. “As soon as I get that, I’m sending the money home,” Halima told me. Within three weeks, the Sponsor Circle had found them a place to live, at a house that was formerly a rental property, and sent over a team of volunteer builders to renovate it. The night before they moved in, the Sponsor Circle held a last pizza party at the retreat center. (Some of the volunteers were surprised to find that the women, cosmopolitan Kabulis, had had pizza many times before.) The room was warm and cozy. Shannon had sewn the girls cloth bags as presents, and drew numbers to determine a fair order in which each could pick a bag. “We’re just thrilled that you chose Duluth,” Shannon said. Halima replied, “We are really happy that you are friendly people.”
It was eight degrees below zero the next morning, as the women packed the last of their duffels and drove several miles to their new home. All four set to work making their beds, unpacking newly acquired knickknacks, including Christmas ornaments, pieces of costumes, and a sparkly magic wand that Halima had collected at a church rummage sale. Akbari hung the Christmas ornaments from a light pull in her room. Halima unpacked her sketches. Flipping through them, she stopped at the faces of women she’d left behind in the safe house. “They’ve moved now,” she told me. “We text with them on Facebook, and every time they text with us asking our sponsors to help them.” She pulled out one painting she’d done at Fort Dix, a portrait of her father, and propped it on her bedside table, behind her magic wand.On the morning of August 15th, Halima, a twenty-two-year-old engineering student at the Afghan National Defense University, was sitting in her dorm room and studying for a final exam when she heard some girls screaming in the hallway. Taliban fighters had just arrived in Kabul, after the withdrawal of American troops, and were taking over the city. Halima, who is quiet, with delicate features, had grown up in a rural village in southern Afghanistan, where her father taught science at a girls’ school. Like many other young women who joined the Afghan military, she was Hazara, an ethnic and religious minority that has long been persecuted in Afghanistan, including by the Taliban.
Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option. Terrie Shannon, a seventy-eight-year-old retired education professor, agreed to lead the circle. “I said yes partly in defiance of the people in this county who supported Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants,” she told me. None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.

In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, in 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, pronounced that “the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared.” Moscow and Washington had veered “from confrontation to interaction and, in some important cases, partnership,” he said. The Soviet Union’s collapse—which birthed fifteen new states, including Ukraine—transformed the world. In the new Europe, Gorbachev added, every country believed that it had become “fully sovereign and independent.” Historians imagined that the end of the Cold War would lead to the demise of the nuclear age, amid new diplomacy and arms-control treaties. The ingrained fears—that kilotons of destructive energy and toxic radiation could decimate a city and incinerate tens of thousands of human beings—began to dissipate. Beyond policy wonks, the word “nuclear” largely dropped from the public lexicon.Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has jolted the world back into an uncomfortable consciousness of the nuclear threat. In the past month, official warnings have emerged at a striking pace. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former ambassador to Russia, warned on April 14th. The U.S. assessment of when and why Moscow might use such weaponry has changed, Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, conceded in testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee. A prolonged war in Ukraine will sap Russia’s manpower and matériel, while sanctions will throw the nation into an economic depression and undermine its ability to produce more precision-guided munitions and conventional arms, he said. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.” Putin’s aggression is “reviving fears” of a more “militaristic Russia.”In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, in 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, pronounced that “the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared.” Moscow and Washington had veered “from confrontation to interaction and, in some important cases, partnership,” he said.

In New Orleans last week to give a speech, I planned to otherwise amuse myself with food and music. It was only while trying to get a weather forecast on my phone that I discovered the Crescent City (for reasons having to do with the location of a factory that made landing craft that proved critical for the D Day invasion) is also home to the National World War II Museum, which TripAdvisor ranked as the city’s best place to visit. Indeed, it’s listed as the seventh-best tourist attraction in the United States, and, since I had been to the rest of the top ten (well, not the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which, for reasons having to do with Universal Studios, is in Orlando, Florida), I figured why not. And a tribute to the museum curator’s art it is: moving, informative, and (even as it celebrates the heroism of that era) sensitive to the ways that America has changed in the postwar decades. Right now, as Earth Day dawns on a planet where the temperature in the Antarctic just rose seventy degrees above normal, and where, two days ago, Vladimir Putin tested his new intercontinental ballistic missile, that history seems particularly poignant.In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars.In New Orleans last week to give a speech, I planned to otherwise amuse myself with food and music.

In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars."

In the early spring of 2017, before France’s previous Presidential election, I took a taxi from my apartment in Paris to Saint-Cloud, a wealthy suburb to the west of the city. I remember the feeling of dread as the car crossed the Seine, the quaint church set into a hillside overlooking the urban sprawl below. I was a twenty-eight-year-old reporter, and Jewish, about to visit the home of Jean-Marie Le Pen, one of the country’s most notorious Holocaust deniers and far-right agitators.Jean-Marie’s daughter, Marine, was running in the French Presidential election for the second time that year, and I was there to profile him for the Washington Post. On April 24th, she will again face off against Emmanuel Macron, in the final round of the vote. The two sparred in a lengthy debate on April 20th, during which Macron hammered Marine for her admiration of Vladimir Putin and reliance on a Russian bank, and she attacked him for ignoring the plight of ordinary citizens. The far right has not been this close to power in France since 1944. Marine has styled herself as a candidate of almost grandmotherly compassion, focussing on the rising cost of living and posing for photos with her cats. Although she is likely to lose, she has already won the battle for legitimacy: polls project her winning forty-four per cent of the vote, which would be her highest share in any of her three Presidential campaigns. She is increasingly popular with working-class and lower-middle-class voters, who say that she has listened to their economic concerns while Macron, preoccupied by the war in Ukraine, has barely bothered to campaign.In the early spring of 2017, before France’s previous Presidential election, I took a taxi from my apartment in Paris to Saint-Cloud, a wealthy suburb to the west of the city.

This week, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, announced the onset of what he called a new phase in his country’s war on Ukraine, which appears to consist of a focus on Ukraine’s east and a more gradual speed of attack than that of the failed strikes of late February and early March. Lavrov cast this tactical shift as a natural outgrowth of Russia’s so-called special military operation, but it has only highlighted the country’s previous miscalculations. To better understand what went wrong with the Russian approach, I called Joel Rayburn, a retired Army colonel and former U.S. special envoy for Syria, who is now a fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington, D.C. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what Rayburn learned about the Russian military from his involvement in Syria policy, the biggest mistakes the Russians have made in Ukraine, and whether the failures stem from poor decision-making or corruption.Do you have an overarching theory for why the Russian military has seemingly underperformed in Ukraine?This week, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, announced the onset of what he called a new phase in his country’s war on Ukraine, which appears to consist of a focus on Ukraine’s east and a more gradual speed of attack than that of the failed strikes of late February and early March.

In the eight weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, the war there has been interpreted in terms that are familiar from previous wars—terms that often seem to be in contradiction with one another. It is a proxy war, and it is a fight for national self-determination. It is a reprise of the Cold War, and a reset of Yalta. It is an inevitable consequence of NATO expansion, and an unprovoked act of aggression by an autocrat bent on reclaiming a “greater” Russian unity that he thinks was taken by Western forces of globalization and political integration. All those ways of seeing the war are apt, but another familiar interpretation is pertinent, too. This is the view of Ukraine as a religious hot spot, where competing claims to a holy city, Kyiv, can be traced back hundreds of years, and where religious commitments and rivalries are deeply enmeshed in the society.Since March 6th, when Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow and primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave an incendiary homily likening Russia’s invasion to a culture war against the West, plenty of questions have been asked about his role and his motives. Is he a tool of Vladimir Putin or Putin’s spiritual adviser? Is his vision of “Russky Mir” (“Russian World”) the basis for Putin’s war or just a rhetorical glaze applied to it? How can a religious leader with any integrity support so brutal a war, and might another leader—Pope Francis, with whom Kirill entered into dialogue in 2016—persuade him to withdraw his support and urge Putin to stand down?In the eight weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, the war there has been interpreted in terms that are familiar from previous wars—terms that often seem to be in contradiction with one another.

Twenty-nine hours into the citywide search for the man who shot ten people on an express train in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, the N.Y.P.D. Crime Stoppers hotline received a tip, called in from a McDonald’s in the East Village. The tipster was the suspect himself, Frank Robert James, who then ambled off. Photos of James, who is sixty-two, had been circulating widely. They showed a heavyset Black man with a shaved or bald head, and dark circles beneath his eyes. At around 1:40 p.m. on Wednesday, N.Y.P.D. patrol officers from the Ninth Precinct found James at the corner of St. Mark’s Place and First Avenue, and put him in handcuffs. At a quickly assembled press conference, Mayor Eric Adams beamed in from Gracie Mansion, where he is in COVID-19 isolation, and said, “My fellow New Yorkers, we got him.”A voluminous history of YouTube videos, dating back years, had surfaced in relation to the case. A man fitting James’s description, calling himself the Prophet of Truth and the Prophet of Doom, appeared in many dozens of videotaped monologues that he posted online. His diatribes involved 9/11 conspiracies, the war in Ukraine, “the matrix,” and dark forces that he believed would use atomic weapons to “streamline, reshape, resize” the world: “The United States will be ruined, just like Egypt, Greece, and all the rest of that shit.” He declared that humankind should be “wiped the fuck out.” In early March, he posted a thirty-one-minute video titled “AND NOW I AM BECOME DEATH,” a quote attributed to Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who expressed regret for his role in creating the atomic bomb.Twenty-nine hours into the citywide search for the man who shot ten people on an express train in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, the N.Y.P.D.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Vladimir Putin downplayed the impact of the economic sanctions that the United States and European countries have imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine. While acknowledging that these measures—which include restrictions on Russian banks, the freezing of much of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves, and bans on imports of some Russian goods—have “achieved certain results,” Putin confidently insisted that the Russian economy “will adapt to the new environment.” As an example, he pointed out that Russia’s central bank has been able to cut interest rates in recent days. “That blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,” he declared.To be sure, there was bluster in Putin’s statements. The sanctions have certainly hit Russia’s economy: last weekend, the World Bank estimated that Russian G.D.P. would decline by about eleven per cent this year, noting that the country was already in “a deep recession.” But most of the sanctions still don’t apply to oil and gas, Russia’s primary exports, which are critical to the country’s trade balance and financial stability. Indeed, with the price of oil and gas having risen sharply since the war began, Russia is now earning more money on every barrel of oil and cubic foot of gas that it sells. These revenues, which often get paid in dollars and euros, are offsetting the decline in other Russian exports, providing the Kremlin with new foreign-exchange reserves, and helping to restore a degree of confidence in its banking system, which was tottering after the initial wave of sanctions.At a press conference on Tuesday, Vladimir Putin downplayed the impact of the economic sanctions that the United States and European countries have imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

Macron captured nearly twenty-eight per cent of the vote; Le Pen managed to win twenty-three per cent. They were followed by the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who won a surprising twenty-two per cent, and the television personality and writer Éric Zemmour, who ran to Le Pen’s right and briefly rose in the polls before finishing at seven per cent. Perhaps the most shocking results were the drubbings given to the mainstream center-right and center-left parties, which won 4.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent of the vote, respectively. The race was marked by increasingly dire rhetoric about crime, Islam, and immigration. Multiple candidates or their advisers warned of a “great replacement,” referring to a racist conspiracy theory that France is being strategically overrun by nonwhite immigrants.

It probably doesn’t work, but I’m gonna try.” With twenty seconds left, Nakamura unleashed an all-out attack, sacrificing his queen and sending forth two rooks and a bishop, coercing van Foreest’s king into a dismal retreat. “Yeah, I’m winning,” Nakamura said, with a wry smile on his face. “Chess is a tough game. . . .

It might have been particularly audible in the New York Harbor, around the Statue of Liberty, that great gift of one republic to another, and where the smaller, original model of republican virtue was displayed just this past year.The good news was that, in the first round of the French Presidential election, on Sunday, while Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremist, anti-republican National Rally, once again advanced to the forthcoming second round, it was with a minimal increase to her tally from five years ago, and significantly if narrowly behind that of the incumbent President, the liberal republican Emmanuel Macron. Nothing is settled, but, though a Le Pen victory in the second round, on April 24th, is not out of the question, it seems at the moment improbable. Adding the votes that went to center and left candidates in this round to Macron’s tally, and adding the votes that went to the even more extreme-right candidates to Le Pen’s, it seems unlikely—not out of the question, but unlikely—that she will be able to cross the fifty-per-cent threshold. Macron should have a small but decisive edge, especially because the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who could never bring himself to actually support Macron, repeatedly asked his voters during his concession speech never to vote for Le Pen. Certainly, not all of his followers will go to Macron, but abhorrence of the extreme right is still a stronger motive for the French left than is abhorrence of the liberal center, strong though that motive is, as well. Non-French pundits see Mélenchon as a “kingmaker,” but this misreads French tradition, by which candidates are expected to declare their second-round allegiance immediately after the first round, and minimal bargaining for support goes on after that.A long sigh of at least partial relief was audible to anyone with an ear open to the wind blowing across the ocean from France last night.

On a recent afternoon, a nondescript S.U.V. parked in front of my hotel in Kyiv. Three men wearing Ukrainian military uniforms sat inside it. They motioned for me and Volodymyr Solohub, a local journalist and colleague, to get in the back seat. Moments later, we were speeding through Kyiv’s abandoned streets, exempted from a thirty-six-hour curfew imposed by the mayor in anticipation of increased Russian shelling. The boom of outgoing and incoming artillery fire bounced off the huge concrete Soviet-era apartment buildings around us, making it impossible to tell where it was coming from or where the strikes might land.Ivan Mishchenko, a forty-year-old father of three with a few gray hairs in his beard, drove the car. A suit hanger dangled from the back of his seat. Stoic and calm, he seemed like a fatherly figure to the two younger men in the car. Mishchenko is one of some two hundred Ukrainian Supreme Court judges, the rough equivalent of a federal judge in the United States. For the last month, he has served in a unit of civilian soldiers who use small, store-bought drones to try and locate Russian military positions. A fellow-member of the unit—the twenty-four-year-old anti-corruption activist Roman Ratushnyi—rode in the front passenger seat. The two men met in Mishchenko’s courtroom, when Ratushnyi was trying to stop developers from replacing a vast public park in Kyiv with high-rise apartment buildings. The third soldier in the car—a tall, bald, smiling twenty-eight-year-old—gave his name as “The Sergeant,” and told me that he was the only one who had been in the country’s military before the war.On a recent afternoon, a nondescript S.U.V. parked in front of my hotel in Kyiv.

There comes a point in most Administrations when an American President confronts his surprising powerlessness. Joe Biden, it seems, has reached that point. Just this week, Biden acknowledged that there was not much he could do, in the short term, to lower the skyrocketing prices of gasoline and food. “We can’t take immediate action that I’m aware of yet,” Biden said. After horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde and Tulsa, he emphasized a similar point: unless Congress passes new laws, he’s all too limited in what he can do on his own about the wave of gun massacres, no matter that the vast majority of Americans clamor for more gun-control measures. “I can’t dictate this stuff,” Biden told reporters, the other day. “I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t change a background check. I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.There comes a point in most Administrations when an American President confronts his surprising powerlessness.

I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
There is no doubt that Biden’s had a brutal second spring in office. The sense of metastasizing crisis threatens to overwhelm any other story about his leadership. Much of the problem, though, is out of his control. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the worst war in Europe in a generation, now looks to grind on for months or years, and trigger global food and energy crises. The Supreme Court, with its 6–3 conservative majority, is about to toss out the five-decade-old right to abortion. There’s the highest inflation in four decades, and fears of a recession to come. Then, of course, there’s the pandemic. As the author Chris Whipple joked to NBC the other day, “What’s next? Locusts?”
Biden’s running commentary in recent days about the limits of what he can do to combat these plagues could be seen as a bit of let-me-level-with-you candor. “Here’s the deal” has long been one of his favorite lines. But this frankness comes at a time when reviews of his approach to the Presidency have been increasingly withering. CNN used the phrase “reactive crouch” this week. NBC headlined its version “Inside a Biden White House Adrift.” In liberal Massachusetts, the Boston Globe recently found support for the President under fifty per cent—and Boston.com highlighted its coverage of the poll results with a comment from a voter: “He’s done next to nothing.” Biden admitting his inability to fix intractable problems might be honest, but it’s also a political problem in and of itself for a President whose leadership has increasingly come into question.
The accepted story of the modern American Presidency has been one of inexorably expanding executive power—an “imperial Presidency,” as the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., styled it— acquiring and exercising more and more authority at the expense of the other branches of government. Yet there is a countervailing narrative, too, especially in this era of political polarization, obstruction, and congressional gridlock, when passing laws requires a level of political consensus that does not exist in a system where actors are increasingly incentivized not to make deals but to brag about their refusal to compromise. On leaving the White House, in 2016, Barack Obama told the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that, despite the “unique” power vested in the Presidency, he had come to realize it also came with a “whole host of institutional constraints” that held him back from both doing and saying what he wanted.
Donald Trump, of course, had a different approach. Rather than lament the limitations of the office, he regularly asserted vast powers that he did not possess. Who could forget his claim that Article II of the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want as President”? He often falsely invoked his “total” authority when faced with obstacles, famously doing so during the initial stages of the pandemic, and then quickly backed away when confronted with the facts of what such an assertion in practice would mean. Some of his executive-power grabs were breathtaking—in 2018, the family-separation policy that resulted in thousands of children being forcibly taken from their parents at the border, until an outcry forced him to stop; in 2019, the defiance of Congress to raid the Pentagon’s budget in order to pay for his border wall, even though Congress had explicitly refused to appropriate the funds he had requested for it. Most often, Trump used bluster to obscure his own failure to deliver on grandiose promises that were never really within his power to accomplish.
Biden may have overcorrected. Which is why, I suspect, the President ended the week delivering an unusual prime-time address to the nation, from the White House’s Cross Hall, with flickering rows of candles behind him in honor of the victims of mass shootings. In his speech, Biden struck a very different note from his hey-what’s-a-President-to-do laments of earlier in the week. He talked of going to mourn with the families of the victims in Buffalo and Uvalde. He shared their message to him and to Washington: “Do something, just do something, for God’s sake.”
Rather than merely bemoaning the influence of the all-powerful gun lobby again, he offered a long list of specific legislation to be passed. He called for an assault-weapons ban and, if that is too politically difficult for Congress, pushed to raise the age at which a person can legally purchase such a weapon, from eighteen to twenty-one. He demanded new “red flag” laws that would allow family members or school officials to ask a judge to temporarily block an unstable person from possessing or buying firearms. He also advocated for a ban on high-capacity magazines, the passage of safe-storage requirements, and the repeal of gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.
Of course, it was still true at the end of his speech, just as it was at the beginning, that Joe Biden can’t dictate this stuff. He wasn’t wrong about that. Yet another crucial moment in his Presidency may once again come down to the decisions of one or two senators in closed-door talks in which Biden is not a participant. Congressional reporters quickly pointed out that many of the gun-control measures Biden proposed, such as renewing the assault-weapons ban and forbidding high-capacity magazines, aren’t even being discussed by a bipartisan group of ten senators who have renewed gun-control talks in the wake of Uvalde. But “Do Something” is a much better message for an American President than “I Can’t Make it Happen.” Especially when there’s a midterm election coming up in a few months.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.
Which means that Biden has a few weeks, at best, to somehow revive an approval rating that currently stands in Trumpian territory: an average of 40.8 per cent approval, 54 per cent disapproval, according to the political Web site FiveThirtyEight. It’s one reason, among many bad indicators for Democrats, that forecasters right now predict Republicans will take over the House this fall, and very likely the Senate as well. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report projects Democratic losses of twenty to thirty-five seats in the House, where Republicans need just a handful of wins to gain control.
And what will happen in June? The Supreme Court will likely decide to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats in the House will try and fail to pass Biden’s assault-weapons ban. There will be more fighting in Ukraine, and the very real possibility that, despite the influx of American weapons, Russia will continue to make territorial gains in the country’s east and inflict heavy casualties. Inflation shows little sign of receding; gas prices may reach record highs. This week, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, warned of an economic “hurricane” that could push oil from its current price of a hundred and nineteen dollars a barrel—which currently seems nightmarishly high—all the way up to a hundred and fifty dollars per barrel, or even a hundred and seventy-five. According to the American Automobile Association, gas prices at the pump, reportedly the metric that is obsessing Biden’s White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, are currently averaging $4.76 per gallon nationally—up from $3.04 a year ago. COVID-19 has not disappeared either, and new variants suggest the possibility of additional spikes this fall.
Not all of these events will necessarily boost Republicans. Some may even benefit Biden. Polls suggest that the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft abortion ruling caused a surge in support for abortion rights. A Gallup poll found support for abortion rights at its highest level since 1995; a Wall Street Journal survey found that fifty-seven per cent of Americans back a woman’s right to a legal abortion for any reason, the highest level since the question was first asked by the publication’s pollster, in 1977. If Roe is indeed thrown out, Democrats are hoping to generate a wave of anger-fuelled support this fall, especially among independent-leaning female voters, who were key to the Party’s success in retaking the House in the 2018 midterms and holding it in 2020.
June will also mark the opening of public hearings by the select committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, prime-time proceedings that Jamie Raskin, one of the panel’s Democratic members, has promised will “blow the roof off the House.” Evidence of Trump’s plot to illegally overturn the 2020 election results—and Republicans’ complicity beforehand and refusal to disavow it afterward—will, at a minimum, reinforce Biden’s message to Democratic voters that they must turn out to avoid handing more power to the “ultra MAGA” and “extreme” forces now controlling the G.O.P. (However, many Republicans, it should be noted, have already started appropriating Biden’s insult as a compliment. “I am ultra MAGA and I am proud of it,” Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, recently said.)
And, besides, reminding voters of Trump’s perfidy is not the same thing as resurrecting Biden’s political standing. If the President wants his supporters to turn out this fall, he needs to convince them, once again, of his leadership. Biden’s speech on Thursday night was not aimed at Republicans. It almost certainly will not miraculously produce an end to the congressional impasse over guns, which long pre-dates his Presidency. Yet, somehow, it still seemed important that he delivered the address. “Enough. Enough. Enough,” Biden said, on Thursday. He might not succeed. He probably won’t.

Just this week, Biden acknowledged that there was not much he could do, in the short term, to lower the skyrocketing prices of gasoline and food. “We can’t take immediate action that I’m aware of yet,” Biden said. After horrific mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde and Tulsa, he emphasized a similar point: unless Congress passes new laws, he’s all too limited in what he can do on his own about the wave of gun massacres, no matter that the vast majority of Americans clamor for more gun-control measures. “I can’t dictate this stuff,” Biden told reporters, the other day. “I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t change a background check. I can’t do that.” And though he is facing a national outcry over the shortage of infant formula, he said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until it was already a crisis—a crisis that will apparently take months to resolve, even with federal intervention.
There is no doubt that Biden’s had a brutal second spring in office. The sense of metastasizing crisis threatens to overwhelm any other story about his leadership. Much of the problem, though, is out of his control. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the worst war in Europe in a generation, now looks to grind on for months or years, and trigger global food and energy crises. The Supreme Court, with its 6–3 conservative majority, is about to toss out the five-decade-old right to abortion. There’s the highest inflation in four decades, and fears of a recession to come. Then, of course, there’s the pandemic. As the author Chris Whipple joked to NBC the other day, “What’s next? Locusts?”
Biden’s running commentary in recent days about the limits of what he can do to combat these plagues could be seen as a bit of let-me-level-with-you candor. “Here’s the deal” has long been one of his favorite lines. But this frankness comes at a time when reviews of his approach to the Presidency have been increasingly withering. CNN used the phrase “reactive crouch” this week. NBC headlined its version “Inside a Biden White House Adrift.” In liberal Massachusetts, the Boston Globe recently found support for the President under fifty per cent—and Boston.com highlighted its coverage of the poll results with a comment from a voter: “He’s done next to nothing.” Biden admitting his inability to fix intractable problems might be honest, but it’s also a political problem in and of itself for a President whose leadership has increasingly come into question.
The accepted story of the modern American Presidency has been one of inexorably expanding executive power—an “imperial Presidency,” as the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., styled it— acquiring and exercising more and more authority at the expense of the other branches of government. Yet there is a countervailing narrative, too, especially in this era of political polarization, obstruction, and congressional gridlock, when passing laws requires a level of political consensus that does not exist in a system where actors are increasingly incentivized not to make deals but to brag about their refusal to compromise. On leaving the White House, in 2016, Barack Obama told the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that, despite the “unique” power vested in the Presidency, he had come to realize it also came with a “whole host of institutional constraints” that held him back from both doing and saying what he wanted.
Donald Trump, of course, had a different approach. Rather than lament the limitations of the office, he regularly asserted vast powers that he did not possess. Who could forget his claim that Article II of the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want as President”? He often falsely invoked his “total” authority when faced with obstacles, famously doing so during the initial stages of the pandemic, and then quickly backed away when confronted with the facts of what such an assertion in practice would mean. Some of his executive-power grabs were breathtaking—in 2018, the family-separation policy that resulted in thousands of children being forcibly taken from their parents at the border, until an outcry forced him to stop; in 2019, the defiance of Congress to raid the Pentagon’s budget in order to pay for his border wall, even though Congress had explicitly refused to appropriate the funds he had requested for it. Most often, Trump used bluster to obscure his own failure to deliver on grandiose promises that were never really within his power to accomplish.
Biden may have overcorrected. Which is why, I suspect, the President ended the week delivering an unusual prime-time address to the nation, from the White House’s Cross Hall, with flickering rows of candles behind him in honor of the victims of mass shootings. In his speech, Biden struck a very different note from his hey-what’s-a-President-to-do laments of earlier in the week. He talked of going to mourn with the families of the victims in Buffalo and Uvalde. He shared their message to him and to Washington: “Do something, just do something, for God’s sake.”
Rather than merely bemoaning the influence of the all-powerful gun lobby again, he offered a long list of specific legislation to be passed. He called for an assault-weapons ban and, if that is too politically difficult for Congress, pushed to raise the age at which a person can legally purchase such a weapon, from eighteen to twenty-one. He demanded new “red flag” laws that would allow family members or school officials to ask a judge to temporarily block an unstable person from possessing or buying firearms. He also advocated for a ban on high-capacity magazines, the passage of safe-storage requirements, and the repeal of gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.
Of course, it was still true at the end of his speech, just as it was at the beginning, that Joe Biden can’t dictate this stuff. He wasn’t wrong about that. Yet another crucial moment in his Presidency may once again come down to the decisions of one or two senators in closed-door talks in which Biden is not a participant. Congressional reporters quickly pointed out that many of the gun-control measures Biden proposed, such as renewing the assault-weapons ban and forbidding high-capacity magazines, aren’t even being discussed by a bipartisan group of ten senators who have renewed gun-control talks in the wake of Uvalde. But “Do Something” is a much better message for an American President than “I Can’t Make it Happen.” Especially when there’s a midterm election coming up in a few months.
Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, is more or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle in the fall. “In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had made up its mind about the leadership in Washington and how they were going to vote in November,” Sosnik observed.
Which means that Biden has a few weeks, at best, to somehow revive an approval rating that currently stands in Trumpian territory: an average of 40.8 per cent approval, 54 per cent disapproval, according to the political Web site FiveThirtyEight. It’s one reason, among many bad indicators for Democrats, that forecasters right now predict Republicans will take over the House this fall, and very likely the Senate as well. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report projects Democratic losses of twenty to thirty-five seats in the House, where Republicans need just a handful of wins to gain control.
And what will happen in June? The Supreme Court will likely decide to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats in the House will try and fail to pass Biden’s assault-weapons ban. There will be more fighting in Ukraine, and the very real possibility that, despite the influx of American weapons, Russia will continue to make territorial gains in the country’s east and inflict heavy casualties. Inflation shows little sign of receding; gas prices may reach record highs. This week, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, warned of an economic “hurricane” that could push oil from its current price of a hundred and nineteen dollars a barrel—which currently seems nightmarishly high—all the way up to a hundred and fifty dollars per barrel, or even a hundred and seventy-five. According to the American Automobile Association, gas prices at the pump, reportedly the metric that is obsessing Biden’s White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, are currently averaging $4.76 per gallon nationally—up from $3.04 a year ago. COVID-19 has not disappeared either, and new variants suggest the possibility of additional spikes this fall.
Not all of these events will necessarily boost Republicans. Some may even benefit Biden. Polls suggest that the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft abortion ruling caused a surge in support for abortion rights. A Gallup poll found support for abortion rights at its highest level since 1995; a Wall Street Journal survey found that fifty-seven per cent of Americans back a woman’s right to a legal abortion for any reason, the highest level since the question was first asked by the publication’s pollster, in 1977. If Roe is indeed thrown out, Democrats are hoping to generate a wave of anger-fuelled support this fall, especially among independent-leaning female voters, who were key to the Party’s success in retaking the House in the 2018 midterms and holding it in 2020.
June will also mark the opening of public hearings by the select committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, prime-time proceedings that Jamie Raskin, one of the panel’s Democratic members, has promised will “blow the roof off the House.” Evidence of Trump’s plot to illegally overturn the 2020 election results—and Republicans’ complicity beforehand and refusal to disavow it afterward—will, at a minimum, reinforce Biden’s message to Democratic voters that they must turn out to avoid handing more power to the “ultra MAGA” and “extreme” forces now controlling the G.O.P. (However, many Republicans, it should be noted, have already started appropriating Biden’s insult as a compliment. “I am ultra MAGA and I am proud of it,” Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, recently said.)
And, besides, reminding voters of Trump’s perfidy is not the same thing as resurrecting Biden’s political standing. If the President wants his supporters to turn out this fall, he needs to convince them, once again, of his leadership. Biden’s speech on Thursday night was not aimed at Republicans. It almost certainly will not miraculously produce an end to the congressional impasse over guns, which long pre-dates his Presidency. Yet, somehow, it still seemed important that he delivered the address. “Enough. Enough. Enough,” Biden said, on Thursday. He might not succeed. He probably won’t. But at least, it seems, he has decided that he’s not giving up either."

In the past two weeks, Joe Biden has attended a summit in Asia; flown to Texas to grieve with family members of the victims of the Uvalde gun massacre; met with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, to discuss the inflation challenge; and announced a new weapons package for Ukraine. The President can’t be accused of slacking, but he and his party badly need a domestic political win. Just conceivably, there could be one in the offing—a new spending deal on Capitol Hill—but, as ever, much depends on Joe Manchin, a.k.a. Senator Roadblock.On Tuesday, Manchin attended a meeting with the A.A.R.P. in West Virginia, then took to Twitter and called on his congressional colleagues to stand up for seniors and reduce the cost of prescription drugs. “By allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month, and allowing the importation of drugs from Canada, we can lower prescription drug prices in America,” Manchin wrote. “We must take action & keep the promises we’ve made to our seniors.”
Not surprisingly, Manchin’s tweet sparked the fury of fellow-Democrats, particularly progressive ones. “You literally killed the bill to do this,” Representative Ilhan Omar, a member of the Squad, quote-tweeted. Warren Gunnels, a staff director for Bernie Sanders, also weighed in, writing, “What a phony. THE reason we failed to keep our promises to seniors is because @Sen_JoeManchin sabotaged the Build Back Better Act & refuses to end the filibuster.”
The point that Omar and Gunnels made was incontrovertible. Last November, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, announced that his Democratic colleagues, including Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona, had agreed to include a prescription-drug package in the Build Back Better bill, which also featured tax hikes on the rich, tax credits for green energy, paid leave, and a range of other social programs. Under the prescription-drug plan, Medicare would have used its heft to negotiate lower prices for eligible medicines, price increases would have been limited for other drugs, and there would have been an annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients. Thanks to Manchin, the Senate never got to vote on Build Back Better. With the Democratic caucus needing all of its fifty votes to pass a bill through the reconciliation process, he went on Fox News days before Christmas and declared, “I can’t get there.”
It’s no wonder that so many Democrats remain angry at Manchin, but they are also aware that he still has a vote, which could make prescription-drug reform and other Democratic priorities a reality. Last week, Manchin met with Schumer about the possibility of forging a new reconciliation bill focussed on three elements: prescription-drug reform, green-energy incentives, and a reversal of the feed-the-rich Trump-G.O.P. tax cuts.
While such a package would fall well short of the grand Democratic ambitions of 2021, each of its elements would represent a significant policy achievement—and together they would give Democratic candidates something substantial to highlight in the midterms. Americans currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the world, and millions of them struggle to afford their medications—insulin here costs roughly six times as much as it does in Canada and about nine times as much as it does in Britain. The need for green-energy incentives barely needs repeating. They are essential if the United States is to get anywhere near Biden’s goal of halving the country’s carbon emissions from their 2005 levels by 2030. And, at a time of historic inequality, the Trump-G.O.P. tax cuts for the rich were an abomination. Reversing the ones for corporations and the wealthy would make the tax system more equitable, and the taxes recovered could help finance the rest of the package.
Schumer and Manchin haven’t revealed many details of their conversations, and, after what happened last year, there is healthy skepticism that legislation could actually be enacted. But there’s still a glimmer of hope. “It’s not dead but it’s also not a certainty; we are trying,” one Democratic source on Capitol Hill told me.
One reason for skepticism is a tight timetable. When Congress returns from the Memorial Day break next week, it will have just six weeks of full sessions before the summer recess. If a new tax-and-spending bill is to materialize, its outlines would probably have to be agreed on this month; this is a big ask. To gain Manchin’s support, other Democrats would almost certainly be forced to accept a deficit-neutral, or even deficit-reducing, package. At a time of low interest rates, the economic arguments for financing long-term climate investments in this way are weak, but Manchin seems to be insisting on it.
For his part, the senator from West Virginia would have to agree not to sabotage the clean-energy part of the new bill, something he is certainly capable of doing. A longtime defender of the fossil-fuel industries, Manchin has set a goal of energy independence, which—it appears—means providing more financial incentives to the oil, gas, and coal industries. Many progressive Democrats adamantly oppose making such concessions, and for good reason. This looks like a recipe for another deadlock, but, as Bernie Sanders recently commented to Politico, the devil is in the details.
What role can Biden play in all this? Wary of repeating last year’s failure, he has so far confined himself to calling on Congress to pass prescription-drug reform and other priorities. That may be a smart move, but, if the talks between Schumer and Manchin become serious, Biden could play a vital role by marketing the new bill to the public—and, perhaps, to wary Democratic lawmakers. The prescription-drug element should be the easiest sell. With inflation eating into family budgets, it would help reduce the cost of living. And, by reducing Medicare outlays, it would also save taxpayers a lot of money: about three hundred billion dollars over ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
If all else fails, the Democrats could perhaps advance a stand-alone prescription-drug-reform bill before the elections, and try to pass it through reconciliation. In politics, as in other walks of life, something beats nothing, and prescription-drug reform would certainly be something. For now, though, the focus should be on trying to salvage something broader and avoiding a repeat of last year. As distasteful as dealing with Manchin might seem, it’s unavoidable. Last week, the senator told Axios that his preliminary talks with Schumer were “respectful” and “encouraging to a certain extent.” What did that mean? Will he play the spoiler again? Quite probably, but the next six or eight weeks will provide the answer.In the past two weeks, Joe Biden has attended a summit in Asia; flown to Texas to grieve with family members of the victims of the Uvalde gun massacre; met with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, to discuss the inflation challenge; and announced a new weapons package for Ukraine.

This created a “cognitive dissonance,” he says, that prevented Ukraine from recognizing the extent of Russian aggression. Having watched as diplomacy failed, Kyslytsya still has to separate his work from the personal toll of Russia’s invasion on his family and friends. “I try not to engage emotionally because if I engage emotionally too much, I am not operational,” he says. “And if I am not operational . . .

Over-all sales generated by the private sector increased at a healthy annual rate of 3.7 per cent, which augurs well for the rest of the year.That is an accurate description of the strong first-quarter G.D.P. figures, released by the Commerce Department on Thursday morning: personal consumption increased at an annualized rate of 2.7 per cent, and nonresidential private fixed investment in equipment rose at a rate of 15.3 per cent. But this isn’t the version that was the focus of news headlines and Republican talking points. The report also showed that the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy’s output, declined at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent in the period from January to March.

“The time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ is coming to an end,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, declared. If the European authorities see a surge of online disinformation during a crisis, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, they will be able to order social-media companies to take “proportionate and effective measures” to counter the threat. Although the new E.U. agreement stops short of treating online platforms the same as traditional publishers (which may be legally liable for intentionally false content about specific individuals and companies), it will force them to provide users with “an easy and effective way” to flag harmful content, so that it can be removed. The platforms will also be subject to annual audits by European regulators on their efforts to counter disinformation and other abuses. Platforms that violate the new law can be fined billions of dollars, and repeat offenders may even be banned from doing business in the E.U.
Ironically, the E.U. members adopted the new measures only days before the board of directors of Twitter entered into an agreement to sell the company to Elon Musk, a self-styled defender of free speech and a vigorous opponent of government regulation, for about forty-four billion dollars. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, who is also the co-C.E.O. of the software company Salesforce, said in a statement.
Evidently, financial considerations overrode any reservations that the members of Twitter’s board may have had about selling the company to Musk, who has frequently criticized its management and demanded changes in how the site operates. Musk’s bid of fifty-four dollars and twenty cents a share represents a premium of close to forty per cent over the firm’s stock price on April 1st, immediately before he disclosed that he had acquired a nine-per-cent stake in the company. But, even though the financial logic of the deal is straightforward, the implications of Musk taking control of Twitter are, from a broader perspective, potentially highly problematic, especially since he still hasn’t answered some pressing questions about his intentions for the site, including whether he plans to allow Donald Trump back onto it.

In a statement on Monday, Musk said that he wanted “to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas. Allowing users to edit tweets  and authenticating their identities could conceivably improve Twitter. The idea of opening up Twitter’s algorithm also sounds benign, although it could  clash with the goal of defeating the bots, because once the spammers know Twitter’s formula for serving up tweets they may be better able to game it.
But none of Musk’s suggestions addressed the fundamental issue of which approach Twitter will now take toward content moderation. Will the company maintain the heavy investments in artificial intelligence and human monitors that it has made in recent years? Will it expand these monitoring efforts as demanded by the new European law? Or will it move in the other direction, dismantling them and allowing the return of former users it had suspended or banned, particularly Trump?
Based on the signs so far, the answer to the last question is yes, Trump and others who have been banned will return. Even though Trump currently insists that he won’t return even if he is invited—he has his own social-media app to promote—many of his supporters are openly celebrating the news of Musk’s takeover. During a staff meeting on Monday, a Twitter employee asked Parag Agrawal, the firm’s chief executive, whether Trump would be allowed back. “We constantly evolve our policies,” Agrawal replied. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know what direction this company will go in.”
Based on some of his public statements, Musk seems intent on taking Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a free-for-all. “I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,” he said, in an interview earlier this month.  If Twitter does go in this direction, it could encounter pushback from corporate advertisers that don’t like being associated with disinformation, incitement, and controversy. Musk has suggested that Twitter should grow its subscriptions base to become less dependent on advertisers, but it’s not clear how many people would pay to use the site, especially if its contents are largely unfiltered.
Musk has also said that his pursuit of Twitter is driven by the desire to protect free speech and “help freedomn in the world” rather than to make money. These are fine-sounding words, but it sometimes seems as if Musk’s notion of free speech amounts to attacking and lampooning anybody who challenges him, including the financial regulators who charged him with securities fraud and fined him twenty million dollars for tweeting  misleading information in 2018 about a possible buyout of Tesla. “Even as Twitter’s board on Monday was debating his offer . . . Mr. Musk was setting the tone for his leadership by tweeting that Securities and Exchange Commission officials were ‘shameless puppets,’ ” Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times’ editorial board, noted. Last week, Musk used his Twitter account, which has about eighty-five million followers, to try fat-shaming Bill Gates, whom he also accused of speculating against Tesla’s stock.
In a column for the Guardian, Robert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, argued that Musk’s real goal in purchasing Twitter is to create a position for himself where he is unaccountable to anything, from laws to market competition. Whether that’s entirely accurate or not, the pending takeover provides yet another confirmation that Congress needs to treat the big online platforms like the social utilities they are, and regulate them. A first step would be to pass the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, in January. This legislation would prohibit dominant platforms, such as Amazon and Google, from exploiting their market power to boost their own products by discriminating against their competitors.
Regulating content in a manner consistent with protecting free speech may be a trickier proposition, but the E.U. has just provided a road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big fines if they don’t. The Digital Services Act is “nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation,” Ben Scott, the executive director of the advocacy group Reset, told the Associated Press. “It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets.”
Musk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that’s too bad. The health of the Internet—and, most important, democracy—is too significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is."
New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/werner-herzog-has-never-liked-introspection;2022-04-26;Werner Herzog Has Never Liked Introspection;"A conversation with the filmmaker about the place of literature, the toll of war, and the conviction that his writing will outlast his movies.
He also wrote two books. The first of these, “The Twilight World,” will be published in English in June, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann. Part adventure narrative, part memoir, and part unclassifiable lyric, “The Twilight World” tells the story of Hiroo Onoda, an actual Japanese soldier who manned his post on the island of Lubang, in the Philippines, for three decades after the Second World War had ended, having convinced himself that it had not. During his thirty-year war—which Onoda described in a memoir of his own, “No Surrender”—he survived more than a hundred ambushes, all while protecting himself against the degradations of the jungle. (As Daniel Zalewski wrote in a Profile of Herzog, from 2006, the “canonical Herzogian tale . . . portrays a man immersed in a situation of almost surreal extremity.”) Onoda was also bombarded with an onslaught of well-meaning attempts to coax him from his post. Yet his delusion persisted. In “The Twilight World,” Herzog writes, “Onoda’s war is formed from the union of an imaginary nothing and a dream.”
I met Herzog in person, in April, at an apartment he maintains in Manhattan. He and his wife, the photographer Lena Herzog, were soon headed to Venice, where she would be showing “Last Whispers,” an immersive exhibit about the vanishing of languages. Her husband and I sat on opposite sides of a glass-topped coffee table that bore books about Bruegel and Goya. For four hours, we discussed Onoda’s dream, Herzog’s literary bugbears, and the genius of Buster Keaton. Up against a nearby wall were heavy-duty cases of virtual-reality equipment. When the interview was over, Lena allowed me to be the guinea pig for the V.R. version of her exhibit. Sitting in the living room, I travelled to outer space and through sinister forests. When I returned to the reality of the apartment, Herzog was seated on the couch beside me, quietly working on a piece of writing.
Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What was your experience of lockdown?
There were a few months when I hardly ever left my house in Los Angeles. I couldn’t venture out with a crew and actors and make films, and so that’s when I wrote “The Twilight World.” I had the story in me for twenty years. Sometimes you have something that is completely ready: you don’t have to think, you don’t have to lay out a plot—it is instantly there.
Once that book was finished, I immediately wrote the next book, which is three times the length. It will be published in German in a few months and then translated by Michael Hofmann into English. It’s some sort of memoir, but not in terms of an autobiography. Only part of it is about my life. It’s really about the origins of ideas. At age seventeen, for example, I stumbled across a valley filled with ten thousand windmills on the island of Crete. I had hired a donkey and was travelling in the mountains of the interior. When I saw this valley of windmills, I thought, This cannot be—I’m either fooled by an illusion or I’m stark mad. I knew my grandfather when he was stark mad, but he was an older man, and, I thought, It’s too early. It shouldn’t happen now.
I put myself together and walked down into the valley and there were indeed windmills. They were there to pump water for the irrigation of this entire valley. There was not a single building, just ten thousand windmills—it was completely insane. The book is about how an image like that lingers, and then, all of a sudden, connects with a story, and holds an entire feature film together—in this case, “Signs of Life.”
You met Hiroo Onoda, the main character of “The Twilight World,” in the late nineties.
I was in Japan to stage the opera “Chushingura,” composed by Shigeaki Saegusa, which is based on the famous story of forty-seven loyal ronin whose lord is wronged and has to commit seppuku, ritual suicide. The ronin avenge him, knowing that, for their deed, they will have to kill themselves in ritual suicide, as well. It’s the most Japanese of Japanese stories—every schoolchild knows about it. While in Japan, I received word that the office of the Emperor had stretched out feelers to see whether I would like to meet the Emperor in a private audience, but I had the feeling that I could speak only in formulas and polite, prefabricated dialogue, so I refused. To this day, I wish the ground had opened into a chasm and swallowed me up. There are benign silences, but there are also shocked silences and hostile silences, and there was a long silence among those with whom I had worked.  Somebody then asked whom else I would like to meet in Japan, and, completely out of the blue, I said, “Onoda.”
For many years, he had declined to participate in a film about his life. But, he said, “If there’s anyone who should do it, it should be you, Herzog-san.” I was very moved by that, and, for a while, I thought his story could be a film. But something stopped me from doing it. I knew the story had to do with elements that are outside of movies—such as how a belief system originates from the observation of the tiniest details, which, all together, form a coherent world view with an almost religious intensity. For example, leaflets were thrown from small planes, trying to inform Onoda that the war was over and he ought to surrender. He would study these leaflets like papyrus fragments of the Bible, and find they contained a small error in one of the Japanese characters, or that they called his battalion by its former name, when shortly before the end of the war his battalion was renamed. For him, this was proof that the leaflets were the work of the enemy.
But I had the feeling that the tragedy of settling into a fictitious life may not have been such a tragedy after all. I have the suspicion that he lived a fulfilled life. And, of course, what fascinates me is not only how Onoda settles into a fictitious life but how basically all of us do, within our cultural norms. In his story, the deeper structure of what makes a human being becomes more visible.
Did Onoda prefer not to know the war was over?
I think he was reluctant, after thirty years of waging a solitary war, to acknowledge that there was no war. This is why he insisted that the young man who found him, in 1974, should return to Japan and mobilize a former major of his unit, who would then come back to the island and issue competent military orders for him to desist hostile activities. The end needed to be formalized and ritualized—only then would the war be over. But the astonishing thing is that he still hoped that the major would tell him, “This was all made up, we just wanted to test your perseverance.” He hoped that the end was an illusion.
The main characters of your films seem to be externalizations of forces within you. What in Onoda were you trying to explore about yourself?
It’s not easy to make any comments, because I don’t like, and I’ve never liked, introspection. But it may have to do with certain things that I’ve striven for: responsibility, a sense of duty, courage, many things that make a good soldier. Sometimes I’ve said I’d like to be a good soldier of cinema—which may be misleading, because people immediately think in military terms, when I’m not thinking in military terms.
What came to mind recently is that, when I look at my films and I look at my writing, I have the feeling that my films are like my voyage out in the world, and my writing is home. That’s where I’m home. I do believe my writing will have a longer life than my films, though I may be wrong. I have misjudged quite often.
Do you consider this your first novel?
It doesn’t have a real category. It probably comes closest to a novel. It’s something that borders poetry, or pure fantasies and pure language—language for itself.
It bears some traces of the screenplay form. It’s very efficient; when it’s nighttime, you just say, “Night.”
Strangely, my first screenplays were prose. I had no idea what a screenplay looked like, but I would write down something that you, as a reader or an actor or a financier, could immediately imagine as a movie on the screen. I would have trouble with actors who would say, “Where is the dialogue? What do I have to learn? What do I have to rehearse?” And I would keep saying, “Don’t rehearse.”
You’ve always had a fascination with people who stand outside of what the majority of us see as history. I think of someone like Fini Straubinger, who is blind and deaf and has no knowledge of the destruction of the Second World War. Or Kaspar Hauser, who spends his early years locked in a cellar with no knowledge of humanity. History as we conceive of it has missed them somehow. Do you see this as a precious quality?
There is something quite important in what you’re asking, and I can make only a very tiny step toward an answer. In my case, I have tried to live outside of the fashionable trends. This has got me into trouble all the time. I make my own observations, and, like Onoda, I create my own world view out of the knowledge that I derive from the world itself. When you travel on foot, for example—and I don’t mean backpacking or hiking, I mean, for example, travelling on foot from Munich to Paris—you are given a world view, an insight that is different or outside of the average knowledge. I have a dictum: “The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.” I do not want to explain it any further.
Your work is distinctly unromantic in its view of the natural world. Do you perceive a new romanticism emerging in reaction to ecological collapse?
The vanishing of nature is also romanticized: the lonely polar bear on an ice shelf. Romanticism has trickled down through Walt Disney, and now we have the Disneyfication of landscapes, of human existence, of storytelling, of our relationship with wild nature. The bears are cuddly and you have to hug them and you have to sing to them. That’s the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell, in “Grizzly Man,” a tragedy of misguided philosophy. When somebody espouses New Age ideas, I always lower my head and charge.
In your films, you seldom have closeups of characters. You prefer to situate them in the landscape. And it seems as though, in the book, you are going for the same effect. The jungle is always pressing in on the men.
I think you’re right.
But the jungle is resistant to a vista—you can’t really create a vista in the jungle unless you’re above the canopy.
You don’t even see the sky most of the time.
Is that what you mean by “the twilight world”?
Yes, but it’s also metaphorical. In German, the title is “Dammerung,” which means “twilight” but also “dawn,” like Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” What is it in English, “The Twilight of the Gods”? We decided we should translate it like Richard Wagner would translate it.
It seems to me that one of the challenges of this story would be narrating the passage of time. The story ranges over decades, and there aren’t many events in a conventional sense. “The jungle does not recognize time,” you write.
The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film. I spoke about time at great length with Onoda. He was fascinated by the notion that present time cannot exist. You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time. We live in a convention, in a fiction of present time, but only by dint of declaration. Technically, it does not exist. We walk on crutches when it comes to time.
You have said, in the past, that, with filmmaking, you don’t care about beautiful images in themselves, only what a shot is about and how it fits into the story. Is content more important than form?
Yes, the substance. Stylizations and formalisms are not as important. If they were, then everything that is kitsch, everything that has perfect form, perfect harmony, would be the greatest of all literature and painting. But no, it is not.
Did the prolonging of the Second World War in Onoda’s mind resonate with your experience of the war’s legacy in Germany—the sense that the war continued somehow, and exceeded the boundaries of 1945?
No, I don’t think so. There was a very, very strong feeling among the German population of “This must never happen again.” Because the deepest of catastrophes was the First World War, and then only twenty years later or so you have the Second World War, and the complete destruction of Germany. Almost every single major city in Germany looked like the World Trade Center after its attack. And that sank in—and it’s in me. My first memory is of my mother ripping my brother and me out of bed in the middle of the winter night, wrapping us in blankets, and taking us up on a slope. In the distance, at the end of the valley, the entire night sky was red and orange and very slowly pulsing. She said the city of Rosenheim was burning. I was only two and a half. Normally, memories do not go back that far, but I know this was my very first memory, and it’s embedded in my soul.
Our conversation is taking place against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.
War is always catastrophic. I made a film with Gorbachev, “Meeting Gorbachev,” and what still resonates in me are things that he kept saying about how many opportunities were missed between the West and Russia to come to “normal terms.” I have seen footage of him in Canada, where he was received like a rock star—that’s a different side of what could have been possible. It pains me. I worked in Kyiv many years ago, as an actor, and I worked in Russia, making films. That’s how I sense the depth of the catastrophe.
You said once that you felt as though we were entering an era of isolation. I couldn’t help but think of you when the pandemic was unfolding, and whether or not you felt as though things were getting worse in that regard.
I would like to see it from its quasi-opposite side: the enormous spread of social media. You can reach out to Nigeria and to New Zealand and to Uruguay with a single tweet, and it may be read by millions. So we are not isolated. You break through isolation. However, at the same time, I do believe that, on a deeper, existential level, our solitudes are increasing, in reverse magnitude.
You never use social media, I assume.
No, I don’t. You may find me, but they are complete forgeries. On the Internet, you find people giving advice for the burning questions of your life with my imitated voice.
How do you feel about all these tech billionaires going to space?
It’s a testosterone-laden competition. One person who sticks out is Elon Musk, because he builds reusable rockets, which I find a very fine and noble thing to do. But, at the same time, his idea to colonize Mars with a million people is an obscenity. We should look after the well-being of our planet, rather than make an inhospitable place livable. You don’t have to be a scientist to know a colony on Mars is not going to happen. As for this race with Bezos and the other billionaires, I think it’s a marketing design. It gives him the label of being—and I say it in quotes, several times quotes around it—a “visionary,” meaning that if you want to buy an electric car, don’t buy it from the Germans, don’t buy it from the Chinese, buy it from the “visionary.”
Do you remember the first time you came to New York?
Yes, I came to New York on a boat, on the Bremen, the same ship that brought Siegfried and Roy the year before. But they stayed and became magicians and moved to Las Vegas. I moved to Pittsburgh and had a scholarship there, which was not very well thought through. I had a vague notion that I would like to go not to one of the Ivy League universities but to a city where there were still steelworkers. I had worked the night shift in a steel factory, and I felt that was the place where I should go. But it was already the beginning of the Rust Belt. I left the scholarship very quickly and was basically homeless, and was picked up by a wonderful family who incorporated me within minutes into their family. I have seen the very best of America, so I’m very fond of my first experience here. Of course, there are certain things for which I have ambivalent feelings, but that’s O.K. My ambivalence toward Germany is even deeper, and you probably have a certain ambivalence toward your own country, Canada. Everyone has it, in a way. But I had such a crazy, wonderful, deep, and priceless time in America, with Americans.
You’ve said that film allows us to delve into the least understood truths of man, our dreams and nightmares. If that’s the level on which film operates, on what level does literature operate?
It somehow touches on a deep level that lives in all of us, in most cases, hidden away—a sense of poetry. People who do not read at all, and do not read poetry or never have had contact with books, still have that inside of them. I’m totally convinced. There’s something embedded in language that we can touch, that we can make vibrate, with literature, with poetry.
I still believe that literature is of very deep importance not only for our singular existence but for our collective experience. In the nineteen-seventies, while making a toast, I quoted a few sentences of Turgenev, and my host toasted back by continuing the Turgenev story for the next five pages by heart. Through language, you establish a togetherness of souls. I miss that. However, not long ago, I was in front of a room of thirty or forty people, and quoted a verse of Hölderlin. Suddenly, somebody was illuminated, and that person came forward, very close to me, and started speaking with me as if nobody else were in the room. So perhaps you still do have that, in a way.
What is the place of literature now, in your view?
Certain things we have to accept. Fifty years ago, prime-time American television showed Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer debating, almost coming to blows. That’s gone, and we have to acknowledge it. We can also observe something much more widespread: people read less. You even see it in academia. Students in the humanities, and not just freshmen, do not read, or do not read enough. They have barely any knowledge of literature and deeper reading. That’s more alarming. Things have shifted very much into forms like tweets or Facebook entries or short messages.
Does it bother you that people are now watching movies on tiny devices and laptop screens?
There is something big coming at us. Just as the movies shifted from silent movies to talkies, so the location of having a collective experience in the movie theatre is dwindling away in favor of streaming platforms. I’m not insisting on movie theatres—although, for me, a movie theatre is still the mother of all battles. But there are things I have to come to terms with. Very young people not only watch a movie on their cellular phone, they also speed it up to twice the speed if it’s too slow for them.
Charlie Chaplin always looks like he’s moving at twice the speed of a normal person.
Eighteen frames per second. But, of course, there was a certain beauty. My favorite character in movies has been and still is Buster Keaton.
There’s no illusion there—he’s really doing it.
Exactly. And it looks highly stylized, but it is not.
The moment when he’s standing there and the frame of the house collapses on him, and he goes perfectly through the window.
I rejoice for having seen that. It’s one of the all-time best moments in a movie ever.
Do contemporary novels interest you?
I read everything. I just read an autobiography, “Forget Me Not,” by a woman who lives in Montana and was married to one of the great mountain climbers of his time. He perished in an avalanche, some thirty years ago, and the best friend of this mountain climber survived, and, returning home, he immediately took care of the three boys of his best friend and took responsibility, and he ended up falling head over heels in love with his friend’s wife and marrying her. It’s not that it’s great literature, but I read it with fascination. Next thing, I reach for Hölderlin. And next I reach for Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian who is not very intelligent—he’s a dumb encyclopedist. But he becomes completely exuberant, and a phenomenal writer, when it comes to the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, and it’s like the most intense soap opera you’ve ever witnessed in your life, outdoing all the Brazilian soap operas. So I’m very fond of Diodorus Siculus for that.
Probably my favorite novelist is Thomas Bernhard. I know you’re a fan as well. Do you have any favorite books of his?
Almost everything that he has written. I never connected so deeply to his stage plays, but I was at the world première of “Heldenplatz,” named after the square where Hitler first arrived in Austria, after the Anschluss. The right wing threatened to invade the première of this play and incite fights in the theatre, so I got myself a mouth guard and went. At the end, they brought Bernhard out on stage. The actors took a bow, and then they walked backward and came forward again and bowed again, collectively. But Bernhard turned his back to the audience and walked with his face to the depths of the stage, and then turned around and came toward the audience again, in the opposite pattern of the actors.
He didn’t often go to the theatre himself. He spent much of his time in his big farmhouse going in circles on his bicycle. Peter Handke told me about him. That’s how I got into him—Handke gave me “Das Kalkwerk” and he said, “Read this, read this. We have a great, great writer emerging.”
His project has resonance with your projects sometimes. His characters are always toiling on these great works that will never get finished—
Or they end up in vicious circles, circles that could go on into infinity, inescapable circles.
I remember reading about your father, and that he was always working on a futile book that never got written. He seemed a very Bernhardian character in a way.
I never made that connection, but you are right. On a superficial level, the book was his pretext for not working and earning money; the woman had to raise the children and earn the money. But I’m absolutely convinced that he talked himself so deep into it that he believed in the existence of this fictitious great study—I think he really believed he was writing an important book, and he never wrote a line. He actually lived his fiction, and in a way you could see him in a context with Onoda.
You once said that you believe that English literature was brought to a sort of dead end by “Finnegans Wake.”
Yes, but I would say literature per se. I perceive a hard core of what constitutes storytelling, and I have the feeling that sometimes literature has gone into a cul-de-sac. “Finnegans Wake” was clearly a cul-de-sac. Joyce worked toward it, convinced that he would explore new terrain for literature, but I do not think he discovered it—because nobody followed up, number one, and it is in disregard of what I see as the central quality of storytelling, which you find in Joseph Conrad, Hölderlin, Virgil’s Georgics, or even the Warren Commission’s report on the Kennedy assassination.
Are you a fan of Joyce’s other works?
No, I’ve never been a fan. I see the poet at work when it comes to “Ulysses,” the different forms of speech, of language. The tools of the craft are being exposed, and he is trying to show you how new his form of writing is. I have the same problem with actors. I do not like actors—and some of them are considered great actors—when I can see how they are acting. Bruno S. is the quintessential opposite of this. I’ve never seen an actor of his depth. There is something in him that deeply resonates with us, something completely untechnical, unstylized, and unformalized.
How did your great collaborator Klaus Kinski feel about your thinking that Bruno S. was the greatest actor you’d ever worked with?
I think he understood it. Kinski himself was furious when somebody would call him an actor, because in a way much of what he does is stark-naked him—with a layer of training on top of it.
Does art need to be more direct?
I don’t know exactly—it’s so primitive to label it like that, but you immediately can tell when you read, for example, Emily Dickinson. You know it instantly: yes, there’s a great poet.
Your notion of “ecstatic truth” seems to have foreshadowed many trends of the twenty-first century: fake news, virtual reality. In a way, your theory has been vindicated by people’s attraction to these forms.
Yes, but I’m speaking of truth, not news. I’m speaking about something that you cannot easily grasp. None of us knows what truth is, so I touch it only with a pair of pliers when I use this word. But, of course, it has been caught up in many of the trends of today, fake news and virtual realities. For example, I read that Bruce Willis, who retired from acting, has sold the rights to his virtual persona for a commercial, which re-creates his facial expressions and his voice. That’s something new and fascinating and stunning.
It’s easy to see as well how ecstatic truth can be misinterpreted and run rampant.
Sure. And when I start to invent certain things—like quoting Blaise Pascal at the beginning of “Lessons of Darkness”—I declare myself. In interviews, I have said this Pascal aphorism was invented by me to give a cosmic feeling, the sense of a cosmic event taking place.
Or the mountain range surrounded by mist that is, in fact, a tire track.
A few inches tall. I do not conceal that I am inventing—but sometimes it’s good that you do not need to know that I’m inventive here or inventive there.
But let me say one thing about ecstatic truth. The simplest way to explain it is by looking at Michelangelo’s Pietà, the statue. Jesus in the arms of Mary is a thirty-three-year-old man, tormented on a cross and taken down, but his mother is only seventeen. It’s one of the most beautiful sculptures that was ever created. And my question now is did Michelangelo try to cheat us, did he try to give us fake news, defraud us, lie to us? The answer, of course, is no. He shows us a deeper truth of both figures.
Inevitably, you’re going to have a biographer.
I hope it’s not going to happen. One of the reasons I’ve written my quote-unquote memoirs is to prevent that. There shouldn’t be a biography—there should be somebody pointing out this film and that film, and how these films somehow make a person behind it visible. You don’t need to describe the person.
I always had the feeling that it would be so wonderful to be anonymous. You can do it in literature, like Ferrante, and it is possible in painting, like with Banksy. But I think both have been identified by now. Some miserable human critter published their real identities. Shame on them.
Are there moments in your films that you would take back?
There are, but I cannot. I threw away all my outtakes because a carpenter doesn’t sit on his shavings. But I’ve learned to live with all the mistakes. Every one of my films has certain mistakes, and basically I’m cringing at the première. Sitting and seeing the film with an audience, I wish I was not alive anymore. But within a week I come to terms with it. Yes, it was me, and nobody saw the mistakes anyway, or hardly anyone. I don’t want to go back and reëdit my films or do some reshooting. You can pay me as much money as you want—I won’t do it.
On the last page of Onoda’s memoir, he’s travelling away from the island by helicopter, and he looks down on his battlefield and asks himself a series of questions: “Why had I fought here for thirty years? Who had I been fighting for? What was the cause?” Do you have any answers for him?
No. No. But it’s beautiful that his book ends like that.
My new book, after this one, ends in the middle of a sentence. I thought of Onoda, who told me he could see a bullet coming at him from a distance, in a strange glow, and he would turn his body away, and it wouldn’t hit the solar plexus for which it was aimed. It would whirr by. And I looked up, because outside of the window I saw something shooting at me, shining in orange and green, and it was a hummingbird. Sometimes they shoot very straight. The moment where I was, in the middle of writing, I looked up and that’s it. The book ends all of a sudden, literally in the middle of a sentence.
So maybe you appreciate “Finnegans Wake” after all?
No, because in my book the moment is derived from solid narrative. It’s embedded in storytelling.
Do you find that the images exist in your mind already and you’re searching for the words to communicate them, or do the images emerge in the act of writing itself?
Quite often, I stumble onto images, like the ten thousand windmills, but very often also the image starts to glow in the distance. I see this, and I turn myself toward it. Where does this light come from? Where is this glimmer? Where does this glow emerge? I never have a plan. I never have any sort of board with yellow Post-its and the line of the story, neither in writing nor in films. The story somehow has evolved in me, or suddenly comes at me, and I can write very fast. When I don’t know how to continue writing, I just continue anyway. I walk once around the house for thirty seconds, and then I continue writing, and something emerges that was completely unknown thirty seconds before. It’s always worked.
Do you listen to music while you write?
Yes, most of the time. I blare it, mostly Beethoven piano concertos. Somehow it has a certain level of excitement and dynamic and push. But sometimes I would listen to choral music from the Republic of Georgia.
Do you prefer a room with a view, or without?
Mostly without. I see something outside the window, like the hummingbird, but it’s very narrow. When I wrote “Fitzcarraldo,” I was in San Francisco, and Francis Ford Coppola offered me the use of his mansion on Broadway. There was a little turret with almost three-hundred-and-sixty-degree windows, and I immediately decided to sit there and write. I gave myself ten days to compose the whole screenplay. From Coppola’s turret, I could see the entire bay and the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. I was completely mesmerized by what I saw out there, and, after two hours, I noticed I had only half a page. So I turned my chair around. There was one segment with no window, and with a ruler and a very sharp pencil, I made a cross on this segment, like the crosshairs in your binoculars. When I looked up from writing, I would stare into the crosshairs and then continue."
New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/the-ordinary-americans-resettling-migrants-fleeing-war;2022-04-25;The Ordinary Americans Resettling Migrants Fleeing War;"After Trump eviscerated the refugee-resettlement system, the government was unprepared for the large numbers of Afghans displaced by their country’s collapse. A new program lets civilians step up to help.
Halima was an aspiring artist, but her father had decided that she should become a civil engineer. She had received a full scholarship at the leading military academy in Afghanistan, where, in her third year, she was first in her class of some five hundred students. “There were a few other girls in my engineering class at first,” she told me. “But, by my third year, I was the only one left.” As Taliban fighters approached the university, Halima left her textbook open on her desk and rushed to escape, grabbing only her passport. Her name and photograph were still posted on her dormitory door, which could tip the Taliban off to her identity.
Halima had nowhere to go; her family lived hours away. “The road was too dangerous,” she told me. “And if the Taliban found out who I was, they would target my family.” She hid in the home of a kindly classmate whose father was out of the country. Soon afterward, another classmate put her in touch with “Mr. Sam” and “Miss Tory,” handlers working with the U.S. military. The handlers directed her to the basement of a house, where she hid with dozens of other women. (Halima requested that I use only her first name, to protect her family.) For the next three months, she was shuttled through a series of windowless safe houses with about eighty other female military personnel, journalists, and activists. Safe-house operators allowed them outside only to be hustled between hiding locations. “When you don’t see the sun for that long, your bones begin to hurt,” she told me, recently. Sometimes the women were crammed into spaces too small to lie down in, so they curled up their knees and leaned against one another to sleep.
Sadiqa Khalili, who was twenty-seven, had passed the entrance exam to become a pilot in the Afghan Air Force and was about to start training. “I sat in the dark, just waiting for the Taliban to come,” she told me. “Everything I’d worked for my whole life had just vanished.” Amena Haidari, twenty-eight, and Halima Akbari, twenty-five, had both worked with Afghan commando units. “We whispered to one another about whether or not we should wipe our phones and destroy our passports,” Akbari told me. For the women’s security, they were instructed not to talk to one another. Taliban fighters were raiding houses, attempting to find unchaperoned girls. The less the women knew about one another, the safer they would be if one were caught. “The Taliban tortures military girls like me,” Halima told me.

In the darkness, Halima’s phone buzzed with threatening messages from men claiming to be the Taliban fighters who’d raided her dormitory. One sent photos of burning textbooks. “You will never read these again,” he wrote. “We will find you, you shameless girl who joined the military.” She wrote in her diary, “Why is it a crime to be a girl in my country? I’m a poor girl in a land of terror with 1000s of hopes and dreams.” She drew in a sketchpad, and, when the other women saw her talent, several asked Halima to draw their portraits. At night, some women whispered into their phones, letting their families know that they were alive. But Halima’s father had destroyed all photographs of her and deleted her number from his phone. He was frightened that, if she called, one of her younger siblings might overhear and tell other children in the village.
The women soon learned that, of the roughly eighty in hiding, only the few with passports—including Halima, Khalili, Haidari, and Akbari—would be able to leave the country. On November 10th, at a safe house in Kabul, Halima received an encrypted message that instructed her to hand her passport over to the safe-house manager. The manager left for several hours and returned with airplane tickets for the next day. “We’d been told we were leaving so many times that I didn’t know if it was really going to happen,” she said. On November 11th, the four women boarded a flight to a U.S. base in Qatar. A month later, they arrived at a military base called Fort Dix, in New Jersey. At the base, they spent their days learning English, which no one but Halima had studied before. “At night, we listened to music and relaxed, which was really a new level of freedom for us,” Halima said. Some soldiers brought Halima canvases, and she painted portraits of the women who had been left behind.
Fort Dix was slated to close to Afghans in the following weeks. Military bases, part of an emergency solution, were never intended to house tens of thousands of new arrivals for lengthy periods; at other bases, Afghans slept in tents in freezing temperatures. There was a push to get people off the bases as quickly as possible, and the women were determined to find a new home together. “We know one another in a way that no one else can,” Akbari told me. But resettlement agencies had been gutted during the Trump years, and no agency had enough capacity to take all four of them.
Soon, the women learned about a new kind of program, called a Sponsor Circle, through which civilian volunteers could sign up to resettle Afghans themselves. A group in Duluth, Minnesota, was willing to take the women in, and to help them find jobs and attend a local university. “We Googled Duluth and saw how much snow there was,” Halima told me. “But their letter also said that they could help us continue our education, and that was most important.” On the morning of Valentine’s Day, they left for Duluth.
This past winter, American military veterans, retired professors, pastors, and hundreds of others took a leading role in resettling displaced Afghans. They’ve met planes from U.S. bases, found apartments, co-signed leases, puzzled through public-assistance paperwork, and located halal meat. (One trick: head to Costco.) The Sponsor Circle program began last fall as an emergency response to the arrival of Afghans. But Lucretia Keenan, a strategist for the program, told me that it was also the culmination of efforts by organizers across the U.S. to ease conditions for newcomers in the wake of the global migration crisis. “This is part of a global movement,” she told me. The Sponsor Circle program is modelled on a successful, decades-long citizen-led resettlement effort in Canada, and a dozen other countries have recently started such programs. In the U.K., two hundred thousand people and organizations have expressed interest in housing Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. Gregory Maniatis, who works at the Open Society Foundations, told me, “It isn’t abstract. People are volunteering to host Ukrainians in their own homes for six months.”
In some ways, Sponsor Circles recall the best of earlier ad-hoc methods of refugee resettlement. In the eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds, religious organizations and their grassroots networks were the primary institutions working to resettle immigrants in America; many saw it as part of a theological calling. But in 1980, after Congress passed the Refugee Act, which outlined the basic tenets of asylum and established the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the process of welcoming refugees became professionalized; since then, almost all refugees have been resettled through the federal bureaucracy. The Refugee Act also granted the President authority over the number of refugees allowed to enter the country. When Trump came to power, he used the Refugee Act, as well as a series of executive orders collectively known as the Muslim ban to block refugees from entering the country. According to the National Immigration Forum, in the fiscal year of 2016, eighty-five thousand refugees entered the U.S.; in the 2020 fiscal year, that number was less than twelve thousand. Federal funding of resettlement agencies is tied to how many refugees arrive in the U.S., and dwindling numbers meant slashed budgets. “Something like one-third of resettlement offices lost their funding,” Maniatis said.
When the Taliban captured Kabul last August and hundreds of thousands of Afghans headed for the exits, their pathway to the U.S. was in shambles. Closed offices and a dearth of caseworkers made it impossible to resettle so many displaced people so quickly. In response, Sarah Krause, the executive director of a nonprofit called Community Sponsorship Hub, and others scrambled to create a program that would allow ordinary citizens to help out. During the past seven months, some fifteen hundred volunteers in more than twenty-five states have formed about a hundred and seventy-five Sponsor Circles to help welcome several thousand Afghans. “Groups have come forward as far away as Alaska,” Krause told me.
In Duluth, Charlotte Frantz, a semi-retired pastor’s assistant at Peace Church, asked her congregation if they wanted to participate in the program. “We were wondering what we could do,” she told me. Peace Church, a place decorated with rainbow bowls and worry stones, has a history of activism. In the eighties, some of its members belonged to the Overground Railroad, a network that smuggled undocumented migrants over the border to Canada. After Trump ramped up deportations in Minnesota, Frantz remodelled part of the Peace Church basement as a sanctuary for people fearing deportation. Duluth is more than a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest resettlement agency—which, in the past, would have ruled the community approach out, but the new program made it an option. Terrie Shannon, a seventy-eight-year-old retired education professor, agreed to lead the circle. “I said yes partly in defiance of the people in this county who supported Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants,” she told me. None had any experience with resettling immigrants or with Afghanistan. “Duluth isn’t really very international,” Shannon said.
On February 14th, Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari landed at Duluth’s tiny airport. “We were terrified,” Halima said. “We didn’t know who would be waiting.” Eight older people stood holding neon signs that read “Welcome to Duluth.” They smiled but held back, afraid that Afghan custom might bar them from touching the women. But Akbari rushed forward to hug Shannon. “We could tell by their faces that these were kind people,” Akbari told me. A group of Benedictine sisters had agreed to house the women temporarily in a retreat center. Frantz and a colleague, along with the sisters, had scoured the bedrooms, removing crosses and icons of saints so the newcomers would feel welcome. Late the first evening, the women arrived at the center and found four deer outside in the snow. The volunteers pointed them out in hushed tones, but Halima and the others grew concerned and asked if the deer were dangerous. “We didn’t know if they might attack us,” Akbari said.
The women weren’t allowed to work until their paperwork was sorted out, so they spent their days padding around the retreat center in slippers crocheted by the sisters. The women began calling Shannon “Grandmother.” One afternoon, Halima invited her over to speak with her mother on FaceTime, and both older women started to cry. “I swore a sacred promise to her that I would take care of her daughter,” Shannon told me. The young women were polite and quick to smile, but any mention of life at home made them grow grim. They worried about the women they had left behind. “We want so badly for them to find a way out, too,” Akbari said. They wanted to send the pocket money they received from the Sponsor Circle—fifteen dollars a week—home to their relatives, some of whom were near starvation owing to an ongoing famine. But the volunteers worried that too much financial support would muddy the scope of their commitment to the women. Frantz, who had adopted a son from Guatemala and had experience with the complexity of distant entanglements, said, “We could set up a dependency we really can’t sustain.” In the end, though, the volunteers helped Haidari wire money home to her father, who was sick.
Frustrations mounted. For Halima, Haidari, Khalili, and Akbari, life as a high-ranking student or professional was over. “We really don’t fit in here yet, and we don’t know the language,” Akbari said. The women had been given donated computers that were nearly useless. They needed to apply for public assistance, but the system was byzantine. They had entered the country on “humanitarian parole,” which, unlike refugee status, did not guarantee that, among other things, they could stay indefinitely, and meant that they still needed to apply for asylum. But many private immigration lawyers were overwhelmed and increasingly expensive. “They are charging exorbitant rates to the most vulnerable people,” Frantz said.
Still, the women found fun where they could. They went clothes shopping, and, after months of washing their hair with dish soap in the safe houses, they each chose their own shampoo. They went to a potluck dinner at the only mosque in northeastern Minnesota. They baked bread and sang songs with the sisters. They played volleyball in the driveway and tried out snowshoeing. One weekend, members of the Sponsor Circle offered to take the four women on a church snow-tubing trip. The night before, however, when a volunteer read them the waivers that they’d need to sign, the women decided not to go. Why, after risking their lives to escape Afghanistan, would they volunteer to do something that might break their legs? “We thought it must be something very dangerous,” Khalili told me.
Earlier this year, I worked with several friends to set up a Sponsor Circle to help resettle five Afghan siblings and their families—all relatives of a journalist I had worked with while reporting in Afghanistan. The siblings were stuck at Fort McCoy, in Wisconsin, and were told that no resettlement agency could take all of them. To insure that they wouldn’t be separated, my friends—including Maria Aini, an Afghan American doctor who had come to Pennsylvania as a refugee when she was eight—agreed to help. The siblings’ aging mother speaks only Pashto, so it was important that they be within walking distance of a community of Pashto speakers. We found them temporary housing at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in a professor’s empty home, which was large and sunny. One of our volunteers, an attorney, helped them with the process of seeking asylum. Three of the siblings now have jobs in customer service, and one of them recently had a baby. But every victory is tinged with a larger sadness for their relatives who remain in Afghanistan. “I feel like a bird whose nest has been snatched away,” the siblings’ mother told me. “I’ve been made to fly far away and leave two of my children behind.”
One of the most critical factors in the successful integration of immigrants is their ability to find a community, and Sponsor Circles help to create local bonds. “It’s proven to make a difference in whether or not refugees succeed,” David Miliband, the president and C.E.O. of the International Rescue Committee, told me. Maniatis, from the Open Society Foundations, told me that he hopes that involving Americans directly in resettlement efforts will help to combat anti-immigrant sentiment: “This is infrastructure that engages a community in social issues and places people at the center of the solution.” Following the success of the Sponsor Circle program, the Biden Administration has decided to launch a larger sponsorship program, which will be implemented later this year. The Administration recently committed to welcoming a hundred thousand refugees from Ukraine, and some of them will be resettled through the new sponsorship program. “The Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans has shown that everyday Americans and community groups across the country are willing and able to step up in extraordinary ways,” a State Department spokesperson told me. “The experience to date demonstrates the powerful and impactful role that Americans from all walks of life can play as they seek to welcome Afghans and now Ukrainians arriving in their communities.”
But Sponsor Circles also face challenges. The program requires that volunteers raise at least two thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars per newcomer, and pledge to help out for a minimum of three months. “It’s nowhere near enough,” Embry Howell, a health-policy expert and a member of a Sponsor Circle in the D.C. area, told me. Sponsor Circles also lack the experience of government agencies, including knowledge about how to access social workers and how to navigate the labyrinthine systems that govern Social Security and other benefits. Howell told me that one woman she works with experiences severe anxiety when using the elevator in their building—which makes it difficult for her to leave the house. “She doesn’t speak English, all of her family is in Afghanistan, and mental health is really the missing piece.”
In Duluth, Halima and the others soon found work in the kitchen of an assisted-living and health-care center associated with the Benedictine sisters. The jobs paid only thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents an hour, but they came with a signing bonus of five hundred dollars. “As soon as I get that, I’m sending the money home,” Halima told me. Within three weeks, the Sponsor Circle had found them a place to live, at a house that was formerly a rental property, and sent over a team of volunteer builders to renovate it. The night before they moved in, the Sponsor Circle held a last pizza party at the retreat center. (Some of the volunteers were surprised to find that the women, cosmopolitan Kabulis, had had pizza many times before.) The room was warm and cozy. Shannon had sewn the girls cloth bags as presents, and drew numbers to determine a fair order in which each could pick a bag. “We’re just thrilled that you chose Duluth,” Shannon said. Halima replied, “We are really happy that you are friendly people.”
It was eight degrees below zero the next morning, as the women packed the last of their duffels and drove several miles to their new home. All four set to work making their beds, unpacking newly acquired knickknacks, including Christmas ornaments, pieces of costumes, and a sparkly magic wand that Halima had collected at a church rummage sale. Akbari hung the Christmas ornaments from a light pull in her room. Halima unpacked her sketches. Flipping through them, she stopped at the faces of women she’d left behind in the safe house. “They’ve moved now,” she told me. “We text with them on Facebook, and every time they text with us asking our sponsors to help them.” She pulled out one painting she’d done at Fort Dix, a portrait of her father, and propped it on her bedside table, behind her magic wand."
New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-nuclear-reality;2022-04-23;The New Nuclear Reality;"Russia’s war in Ukraine has reawakened fears about the bomb—and endangered the principle of deterrence.
Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has jolted the world back into an uncomfortable consciousness of the nuclear threat. In the past month, official warnings have emerged at a striking pace. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former ambassador to Russia, warned on April 14th. The U.S. assessment of when and why Moscow might use such weaponry has changed, Lieutenant General Scott D. Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, conceded in testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee. A prolonged war in Ukraine will sap Russia’s manpower and matériel, while sanctions will throw the nation into an economic depression and undermine its ability to produce more precision-guided munitions and conventional arms, he said. “As this war and its consequences slowly weaken Russian conventional strength, Russia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength to its internal and external audiences.” Putin’s aggression is “reviving fears” of a more “militaristic Russia.”
The Kremlin’s successful test, on April 20th, of a missile capable of flying at hypersonic speeds and carrying up to ten nuclear warheads anywhere in the world—and of outsmarting defense systems—contributed to the ominous optics. “This truly unique weapon will force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice,” Putin boasted on state television. Last month, Washington cancelled its own test of an intercontinental missile to “manage escalation,” the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, testified.
Russia has not yet repositioned its nuclear forces, Burns said, despite sabre-rattling about a heightened state of readiness. Nor is its new missile ready for deployment. But Putin’s reckless war now has a “distinct nuclear dimension”—with lessons that extend far beyond Ukraine and that will endure after the war is over, the Arms Control Association in Washington, D.C., concluded this month. Putin’s invasion “underscores the reality that nuclear weapons don’t prevent major wars,” Daryl Kimball, the organization’s executive director, told me. “U.S. and NATO nuclear weapons have proven to be useless in preventing Russian aggression against Ukraine.” The war has imperilled a long-standing premise of deterrence—having a bomb to avoid being bombed. Kimball reflected, “When nuclear deterrence fails, it fails catastrophically.”
[Support The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism. Subscribe today »]
The war in Ukraine underscores an even bigger problem. The infrastructure of global security—like the bridges, railways, and power grids that make up our physical infrastructure—is decaying. The challenge ahead is to devise a new or more stable security architecture—with treaties, verification tools, oversight, and enforcement—to replace the eroding models established after the last major war in Europe ended, seventy-seven years ago.
Putin’s invasion has also exposed changes to the global balance of nuclear power. Shortly before his retirement last month, I sat down with Kenneth (Frank) McKenzie, Jr., a four-star general who once wore a key around his neck that unlocked sensitive material necessary for the President to respond to a nuclear crisis. In what feels like a throwback to the Cold War and his early days as a young marine officer, he said, the U.S. is again focussed on nuclear threats from Moscow.  Only the capabilities have reversed. During the Cold War, between 1945 and 1989, Washington advanced its nuclear arsenal to counter Moscow’s growing might in conventional arms. In 1954, it tested a weapon a thousand times more powerful than Little Boy, the devastating bomb dropped on Hiroshima. America even produced nuclear land mines. After the Soviets got the bomb, the U.S. still had an eight-to-one advantage in nuclear capabilities during the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962. By the Cold War’s end, the U.S. had developed a “capability and capacity edge, really, over the rest of the world that appeared insurmountable,” McKenzie said.
After the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Pentagon “took a holiday” from studying high-end warfare, the general told me. “We looked away,” he said. The U.S. was drawn into a war in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, in 2001, and then opted to invade Iraq, in 2003. McKenzie was deployed in both wars. The U.S. focussed on conventional conflicts and insurgencies, while  Russia, under Putin, built up its nuclear arsenal. Today, U.S. and Russian capabilities have “completely inverted,” McKenzie said. The U.S. has superiority in conventional arms, while Moscow has more nuclear weapons—and more options to deliver them.
The type of nuclear weapons most at issue has also changed. There’s more than one. The U.S. dropped two strategic nuclear bombs on Japan. Strategic weapons are long-range—they travel some three thousand miles—and produce high-yield explosions. They can destroy vast swaths of land and any human within range. Russia currently has just over six thousand strategic warheads; the U.S. has fifty-five hundred. Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, the two countries negotiated several treaties to limit strategic weapons, though all but one have since been scrapped. The New START treaty is the only surviving bilateral pact; it was extended for five years shortly after Biden’s Inauguration, but it seems more tenuous now.
The other type of nuclear weapons are tactical, or nonstrategic, which the U.S. is more worried about today. They are shorter-range—they travel up to three hundred miles—and often have lower-yield warheads. (Some, though, carry more kilotons than the Hiroshima bomb.) They are designed to take out tank or troop formations on a battlefield—not wipe out a city. In the history of nuclear weapons, there has never been a treaty—bilateral or international—that limits developing or deploying tactical nukes anywhere. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union produced thousands each, with Moscow controlling up to twenty-five thousand. Afterward, the U.S. dismantled most of its tactical arsenal and withdrew most of those weapons from Europe. Russia kept more of its stockpile. There is now a vast disparity in tactical arsenals. Last month, the Congressional Research Service reported that Russia has up to two thousand tactical nukes, while the U.S. has around two hundred.
Today, Russia also has many more delivery systems for tactical nuclear weapons—submarine torpedoes, ballistic missiles on land or sea, artillery shells, and aircraft—while the U.S. has only gravity bombs that can be dropped from warplanes. “They have more diverse capabilities than we do,” McKenzie concluded. More than a hundred U.S. tactical nukes are again situated in Europe, at bases in five NATO countries: Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey. Most of Russia’s are on its western front, near the borders of NATO members.
Four scenarios may lead Russia to use a nuclear weapon, according to Kimball of the Arms Control Association. To coerce Kyiv or its NATO allies to back down, Putin could carry out a “demonstration” bombing in the atmosphere above the Arctic Ocean or the Baltic Sea—not for killing, but “to remind everyone that Russia has nuclear weapons.” Russia could also use tactical weapons to change the military balance on the ground with Ukraine. If the war expands, and NATO gets drawn into the fight, Russia could further escalate the conflict with the use of short-range nuclear weapons. “Both U.S. and Russian policy leave open the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to an extreme non-nuclear threat,” Kimball said. Finally, if Putin believes that the Russian state (or leadership) is at risk, he might use a tactical nuclear weapon to “save Russia from a major military defeat.” Russia has lost some twenty-five per cent of its combat power in the last two months,  a Pentagon official estimated this week. Moscow’s military doctrine reserves the right to use nuclear weapons “in response to the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction” against Russia or its allies, and also in response to aggression via conventional weapons “when the very existence of the state is threatened.” In military jargon, the country’s policy is “to escalate to de-escalate,” Richard Burt, the lead negotiator on the original START accord, which was signed by Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush in 1991, told me. “The idea is to so shock the adversary that a nuclear weapon has been used, to demonstrate your resolve that you’re willing to use a nuclear weapon, that you paralyze your adversary.”
The new nuclear reality poses another challenge: how to limit nuclear weapons beyond Russia and the United States. Nine nations now have nuclear capabilities. Putin’s war undermines the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the cornerstone of international arms control since 1968. It is the only binding commitment—now signed by almost two hundred states—that seeks to disarm those nations which have the bomb and to prevent others from getting it. The treaty is based on the U.N. Charter, which stipulates that all nations must refrain “from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
Since the nineteen-sixties, experts have debated whether Washington and Moscow would use a limited number of tactical nuclear weapons on a conventional battlefield—for example, to destroy a military position or gain a chunk of territory. “The answer is no,” Kimball said. “There is nothing like a limited nuclear war.” At the end of his military career, McKenzie, who spent more than four decades preparing for wars of all kinds, reflected on the nuclear stakes. “We should be rattled right now,” he said. “I am rattled. I’m concerned about where we are.” Three decades after Gorbachev’s speech, the respite now seems illusory."

In our collective memory, America immediately rose to the challenge of Hitler. But, of course, that’s not really true—after Hitler had attacked the Sudetenland and Poland and even France, America was content to let Europe fight its own wars. In the winter of 1940, Gallup found that just twelve per cent of Americans wanted to declare war on Germany. Later in the fall, the country was split down the middle on the question of “Should the United States risk going to war to help the United Kingdom?” Major parts of the establishment—the Chamber of Commerce, for instance—opposed even President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s lend-lease plan to send matériel to defend Europe. Meanwhile, the America First movement attracted a wide following, which included a young John Kennedy and Gerald Ford, not to mention Walt Disney—and, notoriously, Charles Lindbergh. The museum notes the involvement of Kingman Brewster, Jr., who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the president of Yale; in those years, though, as a student activist, he organized across America to keep the country from being “entrapped” in foreign wars."

Jean-Marie’s daughter, Marine, was running in the French Presidential election for the second time that year, and I was there to profile him for the Washington Post. On April 24th, she will again face off against Emmanuel Macron, in the final round of the vote. The two sparred in a lengthy debate on April 20th, during which Macron hammered Marine for her admiration of Vladimir Putin and reliance on a Russian bank, and she attacked him for ignoring the plight of ordinary citizens. The far right has not been this close to power in France since 1944. Marine has styled herself as a candidate of almost grandmotherly compassion, focussing on the rising cost of living and posing for photos with her cats.

Since March 6th, when Kirill, the patriarch of Moscow and primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, gave an incendiary homily likening Russia’s invasion to a culture war against the West, plenty of questions have been asked about his role and his motives. Is he a tool of Vladimir Putin or Putin’s spiritual adviser? Is his vision of “Russky Mir” (“Russian World”) the basis for Putin’s war or just a rhetorical glaze applied to it? How can a religious leader with any integrity support so brutal a war, and might another leader—Pope Francis, with whom Kirill entered into dialogue in 2016—persuade him to withdraw his support and urge Putin to stand down?"

In the middle of March, bulldozers dug trenches in an unused field at the edge of the Yalovshchina cemetery, in the city of Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine. By that point, Chernihiv had been under effective blockade for more than two weeks, with most buildings left without electricity, heat, or water. Roads and bridges leading out of town had either been bombed or were now the site of active battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces. All the while, the Russian military pummelled Chernihiv with bombing raids and missile fire, turning a locked-in city into an urban death trap. As many as fifty people were killed each day, struck down while in line for food or huddling in their apartments.
Where to bury them? The city’s main cemetery, on the northern outskirts of town, was under constant bombardment. Supply routes were blocked, and no factories or workshops were open, which meant it wasn’t possible to produce enough caskets to keep up with the bodies piling up at the morgue. Finally a solution was reached: during episodic lulls in bombardment, city workers would pick up a dozen or so bodies at a time, put them in caskets cobbled together from spare wood, and lower them into the ground beneath a muddy field at the Yalovshchina cemetery."

To be sure, there was bluster in Putin’s statements. The sanctions have certainly hit Russia’s economy: last weekend, the World Bank estimated that Russian G.D.P. would decline by about eleven per cent this year, noting that the country was already in “a deep recession.” But most of the sanctions still don’t apply to oil and gas, Russia’s primary exports, which are critical to the country’s trade balance and financial stability. Indeed, with the price of oil and gas having risen sharply since the war began, Russia is now earning more money on every barrel of oil and cubic foot of gas that it sells. These revenues, which often get paid in dollars and euros, are offsetting the decline in other Russian exports, providing the Kremlin with new foreign-exchange reserves, and helping to restore a degree of confidence in its banking system, which was tottering after the initial wave of sanctions."

The good news was that, in the first round of the French Presidential election, on Sunday, while Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremist, anti-republican National Rally, once again advanced to the forthcoming second round, it was with a minimal increase to her tally from five years ago, and significantly if narrowly behind that of the incumbent President, the liberal republican Emmanuel Macron. Nothing is settled, but, though a Le Pen victory in the second round, on April 24th, is not out of the question, it seems at the moment improbable. Adding the votes that went to center and left candidates in this round to Macron’s tally, and adding the votes that went to the even more extreme-right candidates to Le Pen’s, it seems unlikely—not out of the question, but unlikely—that she will be able to cross the fifty-per-cent threshold. Macron should have a small but decisive edge, especially because the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who could never bring himself to actually support Macron, repeatedly asked his voters during his concession speech never to vote for Le Pen. Certainly, not all of his followers will go to Macron, but abhorrence of the extreme right is still a stronger motive for the French left than is abhorrence of the liberal center, strong though that motive is, as well. Non-French pundits see Mélenchon as a “kingmaker,” but this misreads French tradition, by which candidates are expected to declare their second-round allegiance immediately after the first round, and minimal bargaining for support goes on after that."

Prigozhin is in the spotlight again this month as Putin, facing humiliating military setbacks in Ukraine, looks for ways to regroup on the battlefield. U.S. and British officials say that Russia is now scrambling to mobilize mercenaries from the notoriously opaque Wagner Group, which is reportedly financed by Prigozhin. NATO recently estimated that up to fifteen thousand Russians have been killed in just the first four weeks of the war—about the same as the Soviet Union lost during its decade-long invasion of Afghanistan. Russia is expected to redirect more than a thousand mercenaries in the Wagner Group, including senior leaders, from wars on other continents to Ukraine, the British Ministry of Defense said, last week.  Because of the “largely stalled invasion,” it added, “Russia has highly likely been forced to reprioritise Wagner personnel for Ukraine at the expense of operations in Africa and Syria.”"

So far, the most widely noted area of overlap between the Ukrainian tragedy and global warming has had to do with energy. The fact that Russia’s war machine is funded by fossil fuel, and that Putin uses control of gas supplies to intimidate Western Europe, has begun to shake up energy policy: Germany has moved up its target date for a conversion to clean energy, for instance. And, if the Biden Administration has caved to Big Oil’s insistence on increasing the supply of hydrocarbons, at least that stance is being more urgently and broadly questioned. Last week, in the Times, Thomas Friedman insisted that, instead of doubling down on fossil fuels, we should “double the pace of our transition” off them, because “nothing would threaten Putin more than that,” and because the temperature in the Antarctic last month was seventy degrees above normal. “Our civilization simply cannot afford this anymore,” he wrote, a point underlined by today’s release of a dire and comprehensive report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."

The new location made an already overdone extravaganza feel several measures more lurid (“No one wants to go to that gross ass town,” an anonymous flack told Page Six earlier this week). There can’t be many music fans left who truly believe that the Grammys are a relevant marker of our cultural hungers or tell a story about the best art produced in a given year, though relevance itself feels like an awkward metric in an era in which the very idea of a consolidated mainstream—that there is a global “music” and we can gather to judge it qualitatively—is increasingly absurd. Despite the self-branding as “Music’s Biggest Night,” the Grammys rarely speak in a coherent or edifying way to present trends in music; at this point in the show’s history, there’s not even a significant sales bump for the big winners. (The economist Will Page recently told the Times that Taylor Swift’s 2021 Album of the Year win, for “folklore,” netted her only an additional fifty-thousand dollars in royalties.)

Indeed, Saudi Arabia and Jordan were not represented in person at the summit, although their interests were. (“The Saudis were the real enablers of the meeting,” Cymerman said.) According to Axios, Blinken asked Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, at a pre-summit meeting on Sunday, what alternative Israel proposed to a new deal—other than a U.S.-led, preëmptive strike, which Israel continues to prepare for but, particularly given the situation in Ukraine, the Biden Administration would not want to entertain.

“I don’t think we can say that, on the whole, people in Russia love this war—that they like the idea of going off in search of conquest,” Alexey Bessudnov, a professor of sociology at the University of Exeter, told me. “But I think it would be equally false to say it’s all the Kremlin, that they are simply inventing these figures, that they don’t reflect reality.” People are supporting something, Bessudnov said, but “we should remember what people have in mind when they say they support what is happening in Ukraine.” He pointed out that the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center used phrasing in its survey—“Do you support the decision made for Russia to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine?”—that mimicked Putin’s own. “First, this decision has already been taken, which is a kind of hint right there,” Bessudnov said. “And, second, it’s a ‘special operation,’ not an invasion or war.”"

The polling data confirm the political threat that rising inflation  presents to the White House and, by extension, to Democrats hoping to maintain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections. In the Associated Press/NORC poll, about seven in ten respondents said that the economy is in bad shape, which simply isn’t true if you go by G.D.P. growth (6.9 per cent at an annualized rate in the last quarter of 2021) or the unemployment rate (3.8 per cent in February). Rising prices—particularly the prices of some highly visible items in the family budget—are now at the root of people’s economic concerns. Sixty-eight per cent of respondents to the Associated Press/NORC poll said that they are “Extremely concerned/Very concerned” about high gas prices impacting their family finances, and fifty-nine per cent gave the same response for groceries. As the cost of gasoline has risen by about forty per cent in the past twelve months, and the cost of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs has risen by thirteen per cent, these concerns are comprehensible."

In Moscow, there had also been a sense that the Russian government benefitted from the presence of foreign journalists. Michael Slackman, the assistant managing editor for the Times’ international coverage and a former Moscow correspondent for Newsday, pointed out that the paper had remained in the country throughout the reign of Stalin and the entirety of the Cold War. “Typically there is an understanding that having independent journalists on the ground, if nothing else, is a degree of legitimacy internationally,” Slackman told me. “It allows people to understand your story and your side and your culture and your way of thinking.”"

“The Ukraine” was one of these stories writers love: it came into my mind as one whole piece. It was November, 2017. I was travelling back from a distant village in the mountains, and travelling meant changing buses and marshrutkas, the minibuses used for public transportation. Maybe it was the foggy November weather and the sleep deprivation. The dreamlike, surreal surroundings made me listen to bits of conversations, take in every sensory aspect, and I felt this aching, acute love for everyone and everything around, all the obvious imperfections included."

Desperate to keep the broadcast short, the producers shunted eight categories of awards to the hour before the broadcast—and yet the ceremony ran three hours and forty minutes. Grasping for a larger viewership after last year’s precipitous decline, the producers added two fan-centered segments that stopped the proceedings in their tracks. Trying to gin up enthusiasm for movies themselves, the show looked back nostalgically at James Bond, “The Godfather” movies, “White Men Can’t Jump,” “Pulp Fiction,” even “Juno,” as if to undermine whatever enthusiasm viewers may have for today’s films and to make the luminaries in the hall look like overshadowed latecomers."

What modern Russian economists have done is assemble an immense stockpile of foreign currency and gold: six hundred and thirty billion dollars, thirteen per cent of it in renminbi, twenty-two per cent of it in gold, and much of the balance in the major currencies of the economic West—euros, dollars, yen, pounds. The Russian currency stockpile eventually grew so vast that some Western financial analysts described it as “Fortress Russia”—if Russia were to be isolated in the event of a war, and the value of the ruble were to degrade, the foreign currencies could be used to stabilize the Russian economy and prevent a crisis. In the medium term, at least, these reserves seemed to provide an economic buffer for Putin. Even if Europe were to cut off all imports of Russian energy, depriving Moscow of its main source of revenue, one analyst at the Atlantic Council told the Times, the reserves would allow Moscow to fill the gap for “several years.”"

I travelled with Albright during her four years as Secretary of State. She was a devout diplomat and frenetic traveller well into her sixties. In 1997, we zigzagged across ten countries on three continents in twelve days, including a meeting, at an ungodly hour, at U.N. offices in Geneva, between stops in London, Islamabad, Delhi, Riyadh, Vancouver, and other cities I barely remember. She outlasted us all. Although barely five feet tall, Albright had no qualms about taking on dictators. She confronted Saddam Hussein over his reported arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and made the first trip by a senior U.S. official to North Korea to negotiate with Kim Jong Il on ballistic missiles. She succeeded in neither quest, but she was always willing to try."

Such scenes were fairly routine in classical music through most of the twentieth century, as one country or another took its turn in the role of arch-villain on the international stage. Today, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created a cultural panic of a kind that has not been seen in generations. Several performers with strong ties to Vladimir Putin—Valery Gergiev, Anna Netrebko, Denis Matsuev—have seen their careers in Europe and America evaporate. In a few isolated cases, classic Russian works have been pulled from programs. At the beginning of March, the Polish National Opera called off a staging of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov” that had been scheduled for the spring. A few days later, Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” and his Second Symphony were dropped from a concert by the Cardiff Philharmonic—a decision that elicited worldwide mockery on social media."

The video—which spread widely, racking up at least sixteen million views—was not the product of local YouTubers or activists on Telegram. It was a piece of journalism by Russian freelancers working for Nastoyashcheye Vremya, or Current Time, a twenty-four-hour Russian-language television and digital channel that has broadcast from Prague since 2017—and which is funded by the U.S. Congress. Part of a system that traces its roots to the Cold War, Current Time is a product of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in coöperation with the Voice of America, two pillars of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a branch of the American government that has grown over the decades to encompass five news networks and a technology incubator. (Though it is tempting to assume that these are propaganda outlets—and the Trump Administration attempted to make them precisely that—anyone who has tuned in recently knows that their news programs often cover negative features of American life. Their purpose is more fundamental; as the agency puts it, they seek to provide “unbiased news and information in countries where the press is restricted.”)"

Cowan and Greene have similar positions on many issues, including abortion and gun rights, but Cowan does not believe that the 2020 election was stolen, and, though he voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he had come to see the former President as a threat to democracy after the insurrection at the Capitol. He knew those convictions put him out of step with many voters in the district. Still, he maintained that most local elected officials were fed up with “Empty G”—a play on the congresswoman’s initials that he was fond of—and told me that Party strategists he’d spoken to in D.C. wished they could replace her. He hoped, too, that redistricting might make the district more moderate and set the stage for a more competitive rematch."

The scene is notable for its nearly wordless choreography, and for the tenderness with which it depicts a spontaneous late-night bonding activity between mother and child. It’s also, by my lights, one of the great onscreen food scenes in recent memory. As the camera lingers on the mint bits falling into the bowl or the syrup glugging out of the jar, Sam’s eyes linger on her child.

But it’s not clear why, or whether that pattern will hold.
There are many theories floating around as to why the Russians didn’t go all-out and take down Ukraine’s cellular networks, electric grid, municipal water supplies, and other crucial utilities, either in the run-up to war or in its first days. It may be that the Kremlin, high on its own propaganda, believed that the Russian army would conquer Ukraine in record time and install a puppet government that would need to have those services intact. When that didn’t happen and the Russians began bombing cities, it made cyber weapons that could turn off the lights, say, largely beside the point: a bomb dropped on a power plant is a definitive way to destroy it, with little chance that it will come back online. “If you’re already at a stage in a conflict where you’re willing to drop bombs, you’re going to drop bombs,” Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who is a former Air Force intelligence analyst, told me. In other words, bombs are blunter, more peremptory instruments."

I visited Kharkiv less than a month before Russian missiles started striking it. Most of the people I met there—and all of the men whom I met there—told me that they, and the city, were ready for war. They thought they knew what war was. A Russian-orchestrated attempt to take over the city had failed in 2014, but, just to the east of Kharkiv, an occupation regime was established, and a shooting war went on for eight years. A giant blue-and-yellow tent in Freedom Square, with a banner that said “Everything for victory,” stood as a stubborn reminder that the war wasn’t over.

The area, which is several hours south of Lviv, has become a shelter for displaced people, Bogdan Bolkhovetsky, Davydov’s colleague, told me. Bolkhovetsky, Kraina FM’s station general manager, said that he and Davydov had arrived in the village “by pure chance.” The west of the country is full of refugees, and there are few places for families to stay as they make their way toward the borders of Europe. “We found this place because it was the only place vacant,” Bolkhovetsky said. They arrived in the evening on February 27th; just days later they were setting up the station in a sloped-ceilinged, wood-panelled space that barely fit their two desks. They acquired laptops and a mixer from the supply of aid making its way from the rest of Europe to Ukraine. “We called our friends in Austria and they were so quick,” Bolkhovetsky said. “Guys we’ve never met just sent us the equipment, and a friend of ours brought this equipment in. I mean, they brought us these German laptops and the mixing console and we’ve never seen these people before.”"

What unites these two crises is combustion. Burning fossil fuel has driven the temperature of the planet ever higher, melting most of the sea ice in the summer Arctic, bending the jet stream, and slowing the Gulf Stream. And selling fossil fuel has given Putin both the money to equip an army (oil and gas account for sixty per cent of Russia’s export earnings) and the power to intimidate Europe by threatening to turn off its supply. Fossil fuel has been the dominant factor on the planet for centuries, and so far nothing has been able to profoundly alter that. After Putin invaded, the American Petroleum Institute insisted that our best way out of the predicament was to pump more oil. The climate talks in Glasgow last fall, which John Kerry, the U.S. envoy, had called the “last best hope” for the Earth, provided mostly vague promises about going “net-zero by 2050”; it was a festival of obscurantism, euphemism, and greenwashing, which the young climate activist Greta Thunberg summed up as “blah, blah, blah.” Even people trying to pay attention can’t really keep track of what should be the most compelling battle in human history."

For months, critics—most prominent among them, the Harvard professor and sometime aspirant for Powell’s job, Larry Summers—have been slamming the Fed for not responding quickly enough to rising prices. The thrust of this criticism is that, by waiting too long, the Fed is more likely to have to raise interest rates to a degree that could well cause the economy to nosedive. “The next recession probably has ‘mistaken monetary policy’ written all over it,” Summers said, earlier this month. Still, Powell appeared unruffled by Lawrence’s question.“We have the tools that we need, and we are going to use them,” he responded calmly. Answering another question, he conceded that, with the benefit of hindsight, “it would have been appropriate to move earlier.” But he also emphasized that the Fed’s main policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, is committed to bringing down inflation. “As I looked around that table at today’s meeting, I saw a committee that is acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability,” Powell said."

But Biden has refused Ukraine’s two biggest requests.
In a concise eighteen minutes, Zelensky outlined an ambitious wish list of actions both to help Ukraine and punish Russia. He once again called for the West to create a no-fly zone—to “close the skies” and to limit the ability of Russian warplanes to strike Ukraine’s cities. If a no-fly zone was “too much to ask,” Zelensky appealed for more advanced missile-defense systems and aircraft. “I call on you to do more!” he said. Despite growing pressure from Congress, President Joe Biden has resisted Zelensky’s request for the no-fly zone, and for the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly. Washington fears that any direct U.S. intervention could spark a wider conflict. “That’s called World War Three,” Biden said last week. Zelensky also asked the U.S. to sanction every Russian politician and widen the economic dragnet. “I am asking that Russians do not receive a single penny they can use to destroy Ukraine,” he said.

Speaking recently by phone, Varvara, a young woman whom Peckmezian met in Kyiv, was in tears from the beginning of the call to the end. Sergey, who appears as a beautiful boy in Peckmezian’s portrait from Kyiv, was now sitting in the dark because of the city’s curfew—light in the window might attract bombers. Of the eleven young people I was able to reach last week, some had escaped to the relative safety of western Ukraine.

(Evraz says it has sold steel only to Russia’s “infrastructure and construction sectors.”) At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea’s stadium, in West London, the merchandise store closed and went offline. The club’s credit cards were suspended. Ticket sales ceased.

This event is part of The New Yorker Live Spring Series, which will also include a discussion and Q. & A. about the war in Ukraine, featuring the New Yorker writers Masha Gessen and Joshua Yaffa, hosted by the magazine’s editor, David Remnick; and a conversation about voting rights and the 2022 midterm elections, with the Reverend William Barber and Janai Nelson, the new president of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, moderated by the New Yorker staff writer Jelani Cobb.
Nick Kroll co-created, writes for, and performs more than thirty voices on the Emmy-nominated animated Netflix series “Big Mouth,” which explores puberty, sex, and growing up. His new animated Netflix series, “Human Resources,” a spinoff of “Big Mouth,” stars Aidy Bryant, Maya Rudolph, Randall Park, Hugh Jackman, and Keke Palmer, among others. The comedy, which is set in the workplace and tackles the journey from youth to old age, was released on March 18th. Kroll is also slated to write and executive-produce the film sequel “History of the World, Part II.”"

That call would seem to vindicate what is almost universally framed as Bennett’s “mediation efforts.” They began in earnest a week before, on March 5th, when Bennett travelled to Moscow at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, with whom the Israeli government, backed by two-thirds of Israeli citizens, continues to maintain normal, if cooled, relations. Zelensky had apparently urged Bennett to attend the meeting, which, Bennett’s office said, had the “blessing and encouragement of all parties”—a seeming reference to the Biden Administration. It lasted three hours—Bennett, an Orthodox Jew, flew on the Sabbath to attend, a violation except when “saving lives.” When the meeting was over, he flew to Germany for talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and reportedly spoke with Zelensky by phone early the next morning—their third conversation in twenty-four hours. “The moment there is even a small opening, and we have the access to all sides and the capability, I see it as a moral duty to make every attempt,” Bennett told the Israeli Cabinet when he was back in Jerusalem."

But the longer the war goes on, the bigger the economic costs are likely to be.
This change in tone reflects several factors. The war looks likely to drag out; the United States and its allies have responded to Putin’s aggression with unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia; and the price of oil has gone up to about a hundred and ten dollars per barrel, with the distinct possibility of further increases in the months ahead. According to the American Automobile Association, the price of gas has risen to a national average of $4.33 per gallon, and exceeded seven dollars in parts of California. Higher energy costs act like a tax on the economy, depressing the level of demand for other goods and services. They also contribute to an over-all increase in consumer-price inflation, which is already at its highest rate in forty years: 7.9 per cent in February. The surge in gasoline prices that we’ve seen since the start of the conflict in Ukraine could well lift the March inflation rate to more than eight per cent."

Genocide, the word and the idea, is colloquially understood to describe an effort to exterminate members of a definable identity group through targeted killings. Because the best-known cases involve staggering death tolls—the extirpation of Native Americans and Indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada, of Armenians under the Ottomans, of European Jews in the Holocaust, of Rwandan Tutsis at the hands of Hutu Power in 1994—genocide is often assumed to mean mass slaughter, and to have drastic demographic consequences. But, in international law, genocide has nothing explicitly to do with the enormity of criminal acts. Rather, according to the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, it is defined by the enormity of criminal intent:"

But history does not always revise—J.F.K.’s conduct in the Cuban missile crisis appears, if anything, even better in retrospect than it did at the time, and at the time it seemed impressive. Far from simply staring down the Russians, as we thought then, he also showed them a way out, by secretly promising to remove American missiles from Turkey. And Winston Churchill’s speeches in 1940, whatever grimmer verdicts may be rendered about his imperialist conduct before the war and his sadly incoherent presence after, are still the clarion calls of liberty that they were for so many at the time. Those who criticize Churchill now are free to do so because he protected freedom against some of the most lethal enemies it has known."

In the world of religious diplomacy, the encounter was seen as a breakthrough. It showed Francis reaching out to the Russian Orthodox leader, as he had already reached out to the Eastern Orthodox leader, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, and suggested a fraternal evenhandedness in their dealings. It echoed the 1998 visit to Cuba of Pope John Paul II, whose meeting there with Fidel Castro was seen as the moment when that nation and the free world engaged with each other directly for the first time since the Revolution. And it brought to mind the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev pulled back from the brink of nuclear war after an intervention from Pope John XXIII, who stepped in and acted as peacemaker, sending the two leaders a message urging caution, and then reading it aloud on Vatican Radio."

Jane Campion, one of cinema’s true auteurs, talks with David Remnick about her new film, “The Power of the Dog”—which is set in the West but is not exactly a Western. And a staff writer who recently profiled the Brazilian musical giant Caetano Veloso picks some key tracks that illuminate Veloso’s extraordinary career.

Stephen Kotkin is one of our most profound and prodigious scholars of Russian history. His masterwork is a biography of Joseph Stalin. So far he has published two volumes—“Paradoxes of Power, 1878-1928,” which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and “Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941.” A third volume will take the story through the Second World War; Stalin’s death, in 1953; and the totalitarian legacy that shaped the remainder of the Soviet experience. Taking advantage of long-forbidden archives in Moscow and beyond, Kotkin has written a biography of Stalin that surpasses those by Isaac Deutscher, Robert Conquest, Robert C. Tucker, and countless others.
Kotkin has a distinguished reputation in academic circles. He is a professor of history at Princeton University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. He has myriad sources in various realms of contemporary Russia: government, business, culture. Both principled and pragmatic, he is also more plugged in than any reporter or analyst I know. Ever since we met in Moscow, many years ago—Kotkin was doing research on the Stalinist industrial city of Magnitogorsk—I’ve found his guidance on everything from the structure of the Putin regime to its roots in Russian history to be invaluable."

Ten years later, Hamilton is a global superstar with seven world championships under his belt—and six wins in Austin—but Formula 1 is only just beginning to persuade America’s stubborn sports-watching audience. It was not the sensory effect of the cars that accomplished such a mission, but reality television. For the last three years, Netflix has masterfully chronicled the grand melodramas and intricate microdynamics of Formula 1 (which is often characterized as a travelling circus) in a tight, zippy series called “Drive to Survive,” a show that largely overlooks the complex and fiercely guarded technological aspects of the sport in favor of its delicious and diverse buffet of big personalities. International playboys, Machiavellian billionaires, humble heroes, racing-world royalty, overachieving underdogs, aging has-beens, hotheaded bullies: “Drive to Survive” has them all. “Formula 1 is the ultimate competition: you’ve got drama, competitiveness, high stakes, politics,” Christian Horner, a steely Brit married to Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and the team boss of Red Bull, says. Horner, a game participant in the show, is portrayed as a weasel constantly maneuvering to gain favor with the sport’s governing body. (He’s described by a rival team boss as “a bit like a Jack Russell terrier who will snap at your heels.”) “The drivers have an almost fighter-pilot-like mentality,” Horner tells the camera."

On Tuesday, a new U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia will pursue its interests in “competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways, including pressing to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad.’ ” In testimony on the Hill, William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former Ambassador to Russia, was pressed about Vladimir Putin’s intent. “He’s not going to stop at Ukraine, correct?” asked Representative Jackie Speier, of California. Burns replied, “That’s what makes it more important than ever to demonstrate that he’s not going to succeed in Ukraine.” The stakes, Burns acknowledged, are bigger. “This is one of those pivotal points where we and all of our allies and partners need to act.”"

David and Goliath! Progressive socialist guerrillas, undogmatic and good-looking, too! The world went wild; I went wild. With no previous experience in journalism, or even a remote interest in it, I borrowed money for a plane ticket, flew from my home in Mexico City to Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, and spent the next eleven months reporting on the national uprising. On July 17, 1979, Somoza fled into exile. Two days later, the Sandinistas entered Managua. I had seen for myself the revolutionary fervor throughout the country, and now, together with the crowd, I saw the nine comandantes of the Sandinista leadership—Los Nueve—for the first time, standing on a jerry-built platform, wide-eyed in the central plaza where you couldn’t fit another pin, moved beyond tears, unable to believe that twenty years of sacrifice and struggle had finally led to this, to this crowd."

Putin’s capacity to wage this hideous war depends at home on his capacity to sell his fables of Moscow’s valiant “de-Nazification” of Ukraine. To create the comprehensive information vacuum that he requires, he has jailed his most vivid political rival, Alexey Navalny; intimidated other opponents into exile or silence; declared street protests or dissenting social-media posts crimes punishable by lengthy prison terms; and shuttered the last of Moscow’s independent news outlets. Many of the reporters from those outlets––Echo of Moscow, TV Rain, and others––have, with good reason, left the Russian capital for the safety of Yerevan, Baku, Tbilisi, and points west."

The quick tabloid-media encounter served as a neat encapsulation of what makes West’s career and comportment unique. He is a product, and a longtime inhabitant, of the academy, having taught in tenured positions at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Union Seminary. But he has made it a point of pride to apply his analysis to popular culture and, on occasion, to do so in popular forums. After writing academic manifestos such as “Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity” (1982), he achieved a new degree of fame with “Race Matters,” from 1993, a collection of self-consciously populist essays addressing such hot-button topics as the Rodney King riots, affirmative action, and Black-Jewish relations. More recently, he joined the online adult-education behemoth MasterClass to teach a course on philosophy. In both 2016 and 2020, he served as a tireless surrogate for Bernie Sanders’s Presidential campaign, delivering stem-winders across the country."

Jason Blevins and Olena Lysenko’s “I Never Had Dreams of My Son” follows the father who has never stopped searching for him.
Eight years ago, when Kyiv erupted in fiery anti-Russian demonstrations, the filmmakers Jason Blevins and Olena Lysenko walked a sprawling protest camp on Maidan Square interviewing students, activists, medics, and self-defense volunteers gathered there. Among them was Oleksii Shevliuha, a thirty-five-year-old security guard who seemed to know everyone. Wiry and compact, with a soldier’s upright bearing and the close-cropped hair of a Cossack, he became their guide and occasional protector. He introduced them around the encampment, lent them a hand—and the use of a pocket knife—when their camera stand broke. He gave an account of the history of the Ukrainian self-determination movement, which he had joined in his youth. “I am fighting for my country to finally start living in a new way,” he told them. “For the people to become the rulers in their own country.”
In February of 2014, Ukraine’s pro-Russia regime collapsed, but a separatist conflict, kindled by Moscow, continued in the country’s east. Shevliuha decided to sign up for active duty. He called his father, Oleksandr, at home in Karlivka, an industrial town east of Kyiv, to tell him about his plans, and was relieved when Oleksandr did not discourage him. After a few weeks of training, he deployed to Ilovaisk, in the separatist Donetsk region, as a bomb-defusing specialist. He was there in August of 2014, when heavy fighting was under way. Two days after he arrived at the front line, his phone went dead. Today, Shevliuha is one of some seven hundred and fifty Ukrainian fighters who remain missing since the first phase of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, late last month, there’s no telling how high their number will grow."

They walked past a Ukrainian checkpoint and found themselves in front of the bridge, where ten to fifteen soldiers and civilians were working to help people cross the river on wooden planks. The sound of shelling seemed to be drawing closer, so Sessini took cover near a church. He was about to try to cross a street when he heard a large explosion. A mortar had landed several metres away. A piece of shrapnel struck Maxim Dondyuk, a Ukrainian photographer traveling with Sessini, in the right shoulder, resulting in what he described as a superficial wound. They decided to retreat toward the car. “It was too dangerous,” Sessini told me.

The letter “Z” was spotted on some Russian military vehicles in the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24th. At least two other letters seemed to be in use as well: “V” and “O.” (Ukrainian and Russian both use a Cyrillic alphabet, which contains neither “Z” nor “V.”) On March 2nd, what appears to have been the first attempt at interpreting the symbol appeared in state-controlled Russian media: a military expert suggested that the letter “Z” stood for the last name of the Ukrainian President, Zelensky, and “V” and “O” stood for his first name and patronymic, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. The following day, the Russian Defense Ministry’s Instagram account began publishing graphics with stylized letters “Z” and “V,” and captions offering different interpretations: “Z” could be read as the first letter of the Russian word “za” (“for”), so “Z” could mean “for victory,” “for peace,” “for truth,” and “for the children of Donbass.” “Z” could also be the first letter in the Russian “zakanchivaem”—“we end,” and so could stand for “We end wars.” It could also be the “Z” in “de-Nazification” (though this would require using the English word) and “demilitarizatsiya,” or demilitarization. (The war is framed in Russia in terms of forcing peace upon Ukraine.) Options offered for the “V” included the Russian preposition “v”—“in”—in the phrase “strength is in truth,” and an international symbol for victory, for which the Defense Ministry’s social-media managers offered the tagline “The task will be completed.”"

To a degree that has startled experts in the opaque byways of international finance, the invasion of Ukraine has engendered a systematic campaign to sever Russia from the global banking system, and to sunder the Russian élite from their estates, vessels, and fortunes from the Caymans to Sardinia to Central Park. Since the Russian attack began on February 24th, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union have expanded the list of Russian billionaires under sanctions to at least sixteen. In his State of the Union address, on March 1st, Joe Biden said bluntly, “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.” The next day, the Justice Department detailed a new “KleptoCapture” task force, targeting Russian officials and well-connected élites. In the British capital—mockingly nicknamed Londongrad for the profusion of Russian fortunes—lawyers, bankers, and spin doctors are under pressure to stop helping oligarchs avoid scrutiny. Even Switzerland, which is so devoted to pecuniary secrecy that its journalists can be jailed for writing about financial leaks, has frozen Russian financial assets, including those of Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and nearly four hundred others."

New Yorker;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-sanctions-too-often-fail;2022-03-07;Why Sanctions Too Often Fail;"The West has mobilized vast economic weaponry against Russia. But sanctions do not always produce meaningful or timely change.
Yet sanctions generate meaningful change only about forty per cent of the time. Years of sanctions failed in North Korea, Venezuela, and Iraq. Cuba has faced layers of U.S. trade and arms embargoes since 1960. The Communist regime is still in power. The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, faced multiple sanctions for his brutal repression after the Arab Spring uprising, in 2011, turned into a civil war. Hundreds of thousands have died, yet Assad is still firmly entrenched in Damascus. Sanctions are often sagas. Success in South Africa took three decades. The Iran model, which the U.S. has invoked for Russia, has had gyrating effects. Sanctions also produce heartbreak. The agony is the differential in timing. A gun, shell, or bomb can kill in seconds. Sanctions take a comparative eon in the scheme of war or a humanitarian crisis. “They rarely work,” Benn Steil, of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “But, when they do work, they tend to take a very long time.”"

Prices at the pump already top four dollars a gallon in some states, and Joe Biden’s approval rating stands at just forty-two per cent, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average, so it’s easy to see why the prospect of another rise in prices would alarm some people in the White House. But, with Russia’s government reliant on energy exports for about forty per cent of its income, the moral argument for cutting off these mammoth revenue streams is hard to counter. “The world is paying Russia seven hundred million dollars a day for oil and four hundred million dollars for natural gas,” Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, told me, in a telephone interview from Kyiv this weekend. “You are paying all this money to a murderous leader who is still killing people in my country.”"

As Shore observes, with eerie prescience, Zhadan’s book, though set in 2009, “has become the novel of our present moment, an intimate sojourn in a long-neglected Soviet borderland that is now threatening to bring about the fall of Europe.” In “The Weight of Words,” Masha Gessen examines the moral authority of the Russian activist and fiction writer Lyudmila Ulitskaya. In “Under Siege,” Masha’s brother Keith Gessen considers the complicated legacy of the Russian novelist Vasily Grossman. And, from 2019, here is an excerpt from the Ukrainian-American poet Ilya Kaminsky’s collection “Deaf Republic.” In his introduction, the poetry editor Kevin Young observes that Kaminsky, whose family fled Ukraine in 1993, writes about deafness and war in ways that arouse the conscience: “Kaminsky, who is hard of hearing himself, has the citizens of this republic speak with hand gestures and signs—some of which punctuate and animate the poems—as they resist a world of misunderstanding and military violence.”"

As always, it is important to note that month-to-month job figures bounce around quite a bit. But the February report showed that the economy has displayed sustained strength: the employment figures for December and January were revised upward, and the updated figures show that the economy has created almost 1.75 million jobs over the past three months. That’s close to six hundred thousand a month—roughly three times the rate before the pandemic.  Since November, the employment-to-population ratio, which is a broad measure of the labor market’s strength, has risen by six-tenths of a percentage point to 59.9%, the highest since the pandemic began. That, too, is a positive sign—especially during a period when the Omicron wave spread across the country."

Russia is unleashing a wave of destruction against Ukraine, the neighbor that Vladimir Putin claims is historically part of Russia. Joshua Yaffa, who is reporting on the war from within Ukraine, and Masha Gessen, who has been reporting from Moscow on the response to the war among Russians, join David Remnick to talk about the escalation of violence. Igor Novikov, a former adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tells Remnick how the President’s life as an actor and a comedian has given him an advantage in keeping the West’s attention. Plus: on the fiftieth anniversary of the release of “The Godfather,” Edie Falco reads from Pauline Kael’s review of the film. Kael noted how Francis Ford Coppola’s movie took the familiar outline of a gangster picture and imbued it with the “new, tragic realism” of its time.

It was a snowy morning. Stupak’s fingers were red with cold. Behind him, a local motorcycle club, in matching leather jackets, had brought a giant, Soviet-era mobile cooker.

If Gergiev had been giving stupendous concerts night after night, in the manner of Wilhelm Furtwängler in Nazi Germany, the support for him might have been understandable, though no less problematic. A Carnegie series in 2013, however, offered the dismal spectacle of an artist in both musical and moral decline. The fiery apostle of neglected Russian repertory who electrified the music world in the nineteen-nineties had given way to an overworked celebrity conductor who routinely produced shoddy performances. At “The Flying Dutchman,” in 2020, he seemed disengaged, even bored. Some other factor, apparently, was sustaining his allure. Perhaps it was money; contributions from entities such as Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy company, tended to materialize in his vicinity. Perhaps it was the lingering aura of a once formidable reputation. Once the dubious honorific “Maestro” is affixed, it is impossible to remove."

Is it a new form of citizen war journalism or just an invitation to keep clicking?
Hicks’s picture, of course, is an example of traditional photojournalism—a war photographer capturing action at the front lines of battle in a carefully composed image printed in a newspaper. The video, which as of my last count had more than nine million likes, is user-generated content broadcast online, following the aesthetic norms of TikTok: choppy, decontextualized, with catchy pop music in the background. What stands out about coverage of the war in Ukraine so far is how thoroughly the latter category of content has permeated the collective consciousness, providing some of the earliest and most direct glimpses of the Russian invasion. The Internet-focussed podcast “The Content Mines” called the Ukraine invasion “The Most Online War of All Time Until the Next One.” Other publications have dubbed it the “first TikTok war.”"

Mikhail Fishman, who hosts a Friday-night news-analysis program, was in the studio with TV Rain’s editor-in-chief, Tikhon Dzyadko. Fishman had decided to help host the newscast because his colleagues had been working long shifts since last Thursday, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Fishman was offering some observations on the state of the war. “Vladimir Putin didn’t believe that the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian nation exist. . . . He started a war against Ukraine to prove his point, and he has proved the opposite.” Fishman then directed viewers to a quote from a Guardian column by the historian Yuval Noah Harari, who enumerated the stories of heroism and resolve that Ukrainians had racked up in just a few days: “The president who refused to flee the capital, telling the US that he needs ammunition, not a ride; the soldiers from Snake Island who told a Russian warship to ‘go fuck yourself’; the civilians who tried to stop Russian tanks by sitting in their path. This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”"

The conflict was notable for how much the public already knew about it. The Biden Administration proactively declassified intelligence about Russia’s intentions in Ukraine, as a means to both foil Putin’s false pretenses for starting the war and expose his real motivations: to restore mid-century Soviet order. Another thing was made clear early on: the U.S. would not be intervening. Ukraine isn’t in NATO. The U.S. and its allies, which have adopted a series of tough economic sanctions against Russia, have no treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, no matter how sympathetic the country’s predicament might be. Whatever kind of spitball spin Fox News hosts and J. D. Vance have tried to put on things—stoking the idea that the White House is angling to send in ground troops—the Administration has said repeatedly that it won’t get involved militarily. Yes, there will be worthy endeavors, such as providing weapons, sharing intelligence, and assisting refugees, but our geopolitical might is mostly on hold for fear of conflict with a nuclear power. Crass as it may sound, the war in Ukraine is, for Americans, more of a media experience than anything else. Mostly what we will do is watch."

The G.O.P.’s parliamentary maneuver was an almost unheard of act of obstruction. Its aim was to deprive the Senate committee, which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, of the quorum necessary for a vote on Biden’s nominees to take place. The Republicans’ goal was to block a single nominee: Sarah Bloom Raskin, Biden’s pick for vice-chair for supervision. Had they met to vote as scheduled, her nomination would likely have survived a party-line tie, which under the Senate’s current rules would have advanced it to the Senate floor for the full body’s consideration. Instead, after the twelve Republicans on the committee failed to show up, the meeting adjourned, and the Senate soon after went into recess. This left not just Bloom Raskin but all five of Biden’s top nominees for the Fed in limbo, including Powell."

It is true that Europe has not seen this scale of conflict for some time; it is also true that some of the most brutal warfare in history has occurred on the European continent and continues to happen elsewhere in the world. But as hundreds of thousands of displaced Ukrainians seek refuge with their neighbors, migration policies previously hardened by European leaders against refugees from the Middle East and Africa are rapidly changing. Borders seem to be, for a time, miraculously open. As migrants continue to leave Afghanistan and other places caught up in American and European foreign policy, will the war in Ukraine mean anything for Europe’s other refugee crisis—for the refugees who are not white, possibly not Christian, but who are also in need?"

The problem for President Biden during his first State of the Union address, on Tuesday night, was not that the nation was in crisis but that there were so many of them. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. Inflation. The COVID pandemic. Gun violence. Cancer. The country’s fraying democracy. He seemed to mention all in the course of his address—which clocked in at an hour and two minutes—without necessarily making a particularly strong argument for what he would do about any of them.
In a House chamber filled with the bright blues and yellows of the Ukrainian flag, worn in solidarity with that embattled nation, the President offered some of the toughest language Americans have heard about the Russian dictator, whose unprovoked war on his neighbor is the largest conflict in Europe in decades. Putin was “menacing,” a liar whose “premeditated and unprovoked” invasion would be met with democratic resolve. Recalling the horrors of the last century, Biden sternly noted that, “when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos.”"

Occasionally in Moscow, you might see a clump of police officers in riot gear and a prisoner bus parked on the side of the road, its engine off—which means that the people inside are getting very cold as the bus slowly fills up. In the center of town, police buses have been parked for days, apparently on reserve in case of a larger operation.

If Putin was indeed calculating along these lines, he was gravely mistaken. On Saturday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced that the E.U.—in coöperation with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada—was taking steps to “cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.” The transatlantic allies moved to bar “selected Russian banks” from the global SWIFT messaging system, which financial institutions use to facilitate cross-border transfers of money. And, in a more surprising step, they also announced that they would impose “restrictive measures” on the Central Bank of Russia, with the explicit aim of preventing it from using its large stock of foreign-exchange reserves to lessen the impact of the sanctions. “This will show that Russia’s supposed sanctions-proofing of its economy is a myth,” a senior official in the Biden Administration said, in a teleconference with reporters. “The six-hundred-billion-plus war chest of Russia’s foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it.” The measures the allies announced were designed to block Moscow’s Central Bank from buying rubles from Western financial institutions, a step that could offset the impact of sanctions and stabilize the Russian currency. “The ruble will fall even further, inflation will spike, and the Central Bank will be left defenseless,” the U.S. official predicted."

Kyiv was hit with missile and rocket strikes from the very start of Russia’s invasion, on February 24th; that same day, Russian paratroopers tried to capture a military airfield just outside city limits—an attack that was initially successful, then repelled, and then, if reports are to be believed, ultimately decisive. The northern suburbs have seen ongoing gun battles. It is clear that Russia’s invasion has little to do with the unresolved war in the Donbass, which had been seen as an obvious pretext, and is instead focussed on regime change.

President Biden said the right things. The expected things. His words were blunt and unequivocal. On Thursday, hours after Vladimir Putin’s horrific invasion of Ukraine had begun, the American President stepped into the East Room of the White House and condemned Putin for his “sinister vision,” his “naked aggression,” and his evil, unprovoked war of choice. He called him a bully and a liar and a tyrant. He vowed to make Putin and his outlaw Russian regime a “pariah on the international stage.” He announced sanctions that he claimed “exceed anything that’s ever been done.” But what words, really, could be equal to this moment, to this day when Europe faces what may be the most dangerous and consequential war on the continent since the Second World War?
As Biden spoke, Ukraine was fighting—alone—against overwhelming military odds. There was a pitched battle in the nuclear hellscape that the Soviet Union left behind in Chernobyl. In Kyiv, air-raid sirens sounded for what must have been the first time since the Second World War, and a military official warned that the Russians’ goal was to quickly encircle the capital and decapitate the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Across the country, there were thousands of men, women, and children cowering in subway stations and makeshift shelters, clutching their iPhones and wondering how their twenty-first-century lives had turned overnight into a replay of twentieth-century horrors."

He charged that Putin “has much larger ambitions than Ukraine.” “He wants to, in fact, reëstablish the former Soviet Union,” Biden said. “His ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.” In one of a flurry of statements reflecting outrage globally, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, called Russia’s act “barbaric” and dismissed its justifications as “cynical.” In a tweet, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said he was appalled by Putin’s “horrific” decision to pursue “a path of bloodshed and destruction.” Putin’s military offensive put him on the diplomatic defensive.
