https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream;2022-06-02;NA;"Germany has been forced to admit it was a terrible mistake to become so dependent on Russian oil and gas. So why did it happen?
On Sunday 1 February 1970, senior politicians and gas executives from Russia and Germany gathered at the upmarket Hotel Kaiserhof in Essen. They were there to celebrate the signing of a contract for the first major Russia-Germany gas pipeline, which was to run from Siberia to the West German border at Marktredwitz in Bavaria. The contract was the result of nine months of intense bargaining over the price of the gas, the cost of 1.2m tonnes of German pipes to be sold to Russia, and the credit terms offered to Moscow by a consortium of 17 German banks. Aware of the risk of Russia defaulting, the German banks’ chief financial negotiator, Friedrich Wilhelm Christians, took the precaution of asking for a loan from the federal government, explaining: “I don’t do any somersaults without a net, especially not on a trapeze.”
The relationship would benefit both sides: Germany would supply the machines and high-quality industrial goods; Russia would provide the raw material to fuel German industry. High-pressure pipelines and their supporting infrastructure hold the potential to bind countries together, since they require trust, cooperation and mutual dependence. But this was not just a commercial deal, as the presence at the hotel of the German economic minister Karl Schiller showed. For the advocates of Ostpolitik – the new “eastern policy” of rapprochement towards the Soviet Union and its allies including East Germany, launched the previous year under chancellor Willy Brandt – this was a moment of supreme political consequence. Schiller, an economist by training, was to describe it as part of an effort at “political and human normalisation with our Eastern neighbours”.
The sentiment was laudable, but for some observers it was a potentially dangerous move. Before the signing, Nato had discreetly written to the German economics ministry to inquire about the security implications. Norbert Plesser, head of the gas department at the ministry, had assured Nato that there was no cause for alarm: Germany would never rely on Russia for even 10% of its gas supplies.
Half a century later, in 2020, Russia would supply more than half of Germany’s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories and fuel vehicles. Roughly half of Germany’s coal imports, which are essential to its steel manufacturing, came from Russia.
An arrangement that began as a peacetime opening to a former foe has turned into an instrument of aggression. Germany is now funding Russia’s war. In the first two months after the start of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Germany is estimated to have paid nearly €8.3bn for Russian energy – money used by Moscow to prop up the rouble and buy the artillery shells firing at Ukrainian positions in Donetsk. In that time, EU countries are estimated to have paid a total of €39bn for Russian energy, more than double the sum they have given to help Ukraine defend itself. The irony is painful. “For thirty years, Germans lectured Ukrainians about fascism,” the historian Timothy Snyder wrote recently. “When fascism actually arrived, Germans funded it, and Ukrainians died fighting it.”
When Putin invaded Ukraine in February, Germany faced a particular problem. Its rejection of nuclear power and its transition away from coal meant that Germany had very few alternatives to Russian gas. Berlin has been forced to accept that it was a cataclysmic error to have made itself so dependent on Russian energy – whatever the motives behind it. The foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, says Germany failed to listen to the warnings from countries that had once suffered under Russia’s occupation, such as Poland and the Baltic states. For Norbert Röttgen, a former environment minister and member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU), the German government bowed to industry forces pressing for cheap gas “all too easily”, while “completely ignoring the geopolitical risks”.
In February this year, German Green economic affairs and climate action minister Robert Habeck said that gas storage facilities owned by Gazprom in Germany had been “systematically emptied” over the winter, to drive up prices and exert political pressure. It was a staggering admission of Russia’s power to disrupt energy supplies.
“I was wrong,” the former German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, says, simply. “We were all wrong.”
In recent weeks even Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, a totemic figure of the Social Democrats and greatest German advocate of the trade “bridge” between east and west, has recanted. He admits he misread Russia’s intentions as he pursued the construction of a new undersea gas pipeline. “My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,” he told German media in April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and that our partners warned us about.” This is an extraordinary admission for a man who acted as chief of staff to Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democratic chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and thereafter a lavishly rewarded, and much reviled, lobbyist for Vladimir Putin. Steinmeier was also foreign minister under Chancellor Merkel, and a great evangelist for Wandel durch Handel, the concept that trade and dialogue can bring about social and political change.
How did Germany end up making such a blunder? Some argue that Merkel should have seen that Putin was taking Russia in an authoritarian direction when he announced his return to the presidency in 2011. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Germany made no move to stop importing Russian gas, and although Merkel threatened to introduce crippling trade sanctions, German industry convinced her to hold back. But some blame a more persistent misjudgment stretching back 50 years, based on a fallacy that authoritarian countries can be transformed through trade.
The Social Democrats have now set up a review into whether the policy of Ostpolitik, first laid out in a landmark speech in July 1963 by Egon Bahr, then chancellor Willy Brandt’s closest adviser, became deformed over time – especially after securing its great achievement, the fall of the Berlin Wall.
What is extraordinary, retracing the history through memoirs and contemporary records, is how frequently and determinedly Germany was warned, by everyone from Henry Kissinger onwards, that it was making a pact it might live to regret. Kissinger wrote to Richard Nixon on 9 April 1970: “Few people, either inside Germany or abroad, see Brandt as selling out to the East; what worries people is whether he can control what he has started.” Over 50 years, Germany fought numerous battles with a series of US presidents over its growing dependence on Russian energy. In the process, Germany’s foreign office developed a view of American anti-communism as naive, and a belief that only Germany truly understood the Soviet Union.
From the late 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany tried to open its own direct line of communication with the Soviet leadership, even though its interest in reunification created tensions with the US. When it faced criticism from the US, Germany was wont to cite its unique status. “I cannot imagine there is anyone more interested in being allowed to continue working for detente and balance in Europe than the German people who are forced to live in two states,” Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then the foreign minister, told the German Bundestag in January 1980, to great applause.
But after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, why was Germany still so reluctant to listen to others? A sense of guilt for the atrocities committed against the Soviet Union during the second world war may have played a role. Pride, too, that – through Ostpolitik – it had mended its relations with Moscow. Germany, in a sense, became a double prisoner of its past – bound both to the horrors it had committed, and to its belief that its response to those horrors was correct.
The conflicts between Germany and the US in the 70s and 80s, involving two very different presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, were some of the most rancorous transatlantic battles since the second world war. “The disputes were all part of West Germany showing independence in foreign policy during the cold war, and that became uncomfortable for some American leaders,” the historian Mary Elise Sarotte said to me.
Carter and the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had little respect for each other. Carter found Schmidt moody, while the chancellor, in his autobiography, dismissed Carter as an idealistic preacher, who knew nothing of Europe and was “just not big enough for the game”. The two leaders did not just grate personally, they disagreed on issues of substance – including how to protect human rights in Russia. In 1979 Schmidt and Carter came together to jointly adopt the so-called dual track decision, by which Nato would upgrade its nuclear weapons based in Europe, while actively seeking an arms control agreement with Russia. But in other ways their approach was very different.
Schmidt never lacked self-confidence, but like many Germans of that era he carried a deep sense of shame arising from painful war memories. He also believed that the stability of the eastern bloc was in the interest of West Germany, given Russia’s nuclear capability. In his autobiography he wrote that he had wanted to develop trading relations with Russia, in order to foster “a greater Soviet dependence upon European supplies”, in turn leading to “more European influence” on Moscow’s policies. And following the 1973 oil crisis, Schmidt became convinced that the Soviet Union represented a more reliable supplier of energy for Germany than the Gulf states.
Carter, by contrast, saw withholding trade as the better way to influence the Soviets. In July 1978, responding to Moscow’s imprisonment of two Soviet dissidents, Aleksandr Ginzburg and Anatoly Shcharansky, Carter restricted US exports of technology for the exploration and development of the Soviet oil and natural-gas industries.
Yet, collectively, European business went in the opposite direction. Even after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, a large German business delegation went ahead with a visit to Moscow. The Soviets (Soyuzgazexport) and western Europeans (chiefly Ruhrgas and Gaz de France) completed negotiations on a new giant gas project, a 4,500km dedicated pipeline from the giant Urengoy field in West Siberia in late 1980. This deal was projected to increase Germany’s dependence on Russian gas from 15% to 30%. When German ministers reviewed the security implications, they concluded there was no danger of Russia misusing its potential stranglehold. Their reasoning was simple. “Long-term disruption would be against the self-interest of the Soviet Union,” the ministry decided.
In a phone call with Carter on 5 March, Schmidt explained his support for the pipeline by telling the US president, “Those engaging in trade with each other do not shoot at one another.” It was a restatement of Norman Angell’s famous pre-first world war theory that the new interdependence of economies made war unprofitable and thus irrational. According to a note in his diary, Carter responded: “It is not beneficial for the Europeans to expect us to provide the stick and for them to compete with one another about providing the biggest carrot.”
In 1980, Schmidt wrote: “To speak of the Federal Republic’s economic dependence on Moscow to a degree large enough to affect foreign policy indicates ignorance or malice.” Given Germany’s plight now, those words look hopelessly misjudged.
Schmidt faced a more challenging opponent in Carter’s successor, the traditional anti-communist Ronald Reagan. In Reagan’s eyes, German trade with Russia was in direct conflict with western security. Reagan’s view was informed by a CIA assessment submitted in July 1981, which noted a clear trend: from 1970 to 1980, Soviet gas exports to western Europe had risen from 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year to 26.5bcm annually. The CIA warned Reagan that the Urengoy gas project would not only accelerate Soviet economic growth, but provide the Soviets with $8bn in hard currency, facilitating a further military buildup. Far from giving Germany sway over Soviet thinking, “it would provide the Soviets one additional pressure point they could use as part of a broader diplomatic offensive to persuade the West Europeans to accept their viewpoint on East-West issues”.
In arguments that echo today’s debates, the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, complained: “We consistently find in our talks the allies are already significantly dependent: France for 15% [of its] gas, Germany for 30%.” Schmidt assured the Americans that Germany “can go six months in the event of a Soviet cut-off”. The forecast now is that, in such an eventuality, Germany would have to go straight to a form of energy rationing.
Despite various US efforts to persuade Europe to adopt a voluntary ban, including offering alternative sources of energy, in 1981 Ruhrgas AG and Soyusgazexport went ahead and signed a contract for annual imports of 10.5bcm of Soviet gas over a 25-year period. Unemployment in Europe was close to 9% at the time, and European industry needed to boost its energy supplies. At the same time, the US argument about security was dismissed as a veiled way of promoting the US oil industry.
When Moscow backed the imposition of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981, Reagan thought such a shocking event might persuade Germany to put the pipeline on hold. In a private note to Margaret Thatcher, sent on 19 December 1981, he urged her to back tough sanctions against the Soviets, stating that “this may well be a watershed in the history of mankind. A challenge to tyranny from within.” Unusually for her, Thatcher vacillated, advising Reagan that the Germans “cannot and will not give up the gas pipeline project”.
The US responded to the Soviet intervention by banning US companies from helping with the pipeline. In the summer of 1982 Reagan tried to force European firms to stop working on the pipeline by imposing secondary sanctions on them. Such sanctions are now a commonplace in the US foreign policy armoury, particularly over Iran, but then, they were seen as an incursion into European sovereignty. Thatcher bridled, telling the Commons “it is wrong” for “one very powerful nation [to] prevent existing contracts being fulfilled”.
By November, Reagan had abandoned the attempt to impose sanctions. In a trial of strength in which Europe sided with Germany, the world’s superpower had lost. The new pipeline started pumping on 1 January 1984.
The German advocates of change through trade had won. The US position on Russia was further weakened when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The peaceful collapse of communism was trumpeted as a vindication for those that had championed dialogue, and engagement through trade. In a speech to the Brandt Foundation in March 2008, Steinmeier gave full vent to this view: “What Ostpolitik in fact achieved – as is now recognised also by those who criticised it at the time,” he said, “was to make peace in Europe, despite the difficulties, a degree more secure. For the democracy movements in eastern Europe it created new possibilities, new scope for action. It was a key factor, too, in finally ending the confrontation between the two blocs.”
Olaf Scholz, Germany’s current chancellor, remains an adherent of this view, arguing last year that it contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and laid the basis for democracy and EU membership for much of eastern Europe. The SPD co-leader, Lars Klingbeil, has also insisted that Ostpolitik “was the basis for reunification and the end of the cold war. As a result, there has been a consensus in the federal republic for decades that conflicts can be defused through dialogue. We won’t let that be bad-mouthed.”
Yet a number of historians and writers believe that this rosy picture of Ostpolitik is misleading. “The idea that Willy Brandt’s policy of detente towards Moscow led in a straight line to the fall of the iron curtain and German unity is at least an over-simplification,” says the historian Jan Behrends. German journalist Thomas Urban, author of a new book critiquing Ostpolitik, believes its role in the fall of the wall and German reunification has been exaggerated: “It was military buildup by Reagan and the flooding of the market with cheap oil that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he told me. The Russian government budget had grown so dependent on energy for its revenue, he said, that when the price of oil plummeted in the mid-1980s, Russia’s lifeline to external capital dried up. “Gorbachev could no longer fund the overseas wars and the Soviet Republics,” he said. “But this argument was entirely missing in the German debate, especially on the left.”
Urban argued that Ostpolitik’s theory of change suffered from two basic misconceptions: the belief that political change in eastern Europe could only come from engaging with the elite in power, rather than from civilian movements, and second, that “security must be the key to everything”.
By the turn of the century, the advocates of change through trade were in their pomp. Chancellor Schröder, with growing confidence, promoted the idea of a strategic partnership with Russia. He invited the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to address the Bundestag in 2001, where he won over his audience by giving the speech in fluent German and declaring “the cold war is over”.
Schröder, at the time of Putin’s address, saw a perfect confluence of interests between Europe, Germany and Russia: peace, stability, multilateralism and economic growth. Putin, Schröder was convinced, “wants to transform Russia into a democracy”.
In this favourable political climate, pro-Russian German lobbyists such as Klaus Mangold, chairman of the powerful German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, pursued the construction of yet another gas pipeline, this time taking gas from Vyborg under the Baltic Sea to Germany – the first Nord Stream. The scheme was especially controversial since it would bypass Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, reducing those countries’ incomes, weakening their bargaining power and depriving them of badly needed transit fees. The €7.4bn pipeline construction costs were to be borne by the private German companies BASF and E.ON, and the majority Russian state-owned Gazprom.
This time, protests against the pipeline did not just come from the US, but from the states that had recently emerged from Soviet rule, such as Poland and Lithuania. Radosław Sikorski, then Poland’s defence minister, notoriously compared the plan to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which paved the way for the invasion of Poland.
Yet on 8 September 2005, 10 days before the election in which Schröder’s Social Democrats lost to Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the Nord Stream 1 contract was signed in Berlin by representatives of Gazprom, E.ON and BASF. Putin stood alongside Schröder at the signing ceremony.
Schröder has since been singled out for his role in creating Germany’s dependence on Russian energy, and getting very rich in the process. But the distinguished former German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger recently argued that Schröder should not take the blame for giving the go-ahead to Nord Stream 20 years ago: most German politicians, he told the New York Times in April, did not question whether they were getting into an unhealthy dependence on Russian energy. In the article, Schröder made the same case: “It never occurred to anyone that this could become a problem. It was just a way of procuring gas for Germans, for Germany’s heavy industry, and also for the chemical industry, with fewer problems and disruptions.”
Thereafter it seemed, whatever the setbacks in German-Russian relations, nothing could shift the faith in trade – not Russia’s “peace enforcement operation” in Georgia in August 2008, not the Russian disruption of the gas pipelines in a dispute with Ukraine in January 2009, nor the news that Putin was planning to return to the presidency in 2012, replacing Dmitry Medvedev, in whom Frank-Walter Steinmeier had placed his faith. In 2011, the year Nord Stream finally opened, German total trade exports to Russia rose 34% to €27bn.
Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2014. Initially, Russia’s incursion seemed to mark a turning point. Merkel’s condemnation was clear: the annexation of Crimea was contrary to international law. Sanctions were duly imposed, and German exports to Russia fell.
Following the 2014 invasion, serious German media such as Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published lengthy articles looking at the options for how Germany could wean itself off its dangerous dependency on Russian energy. Many of the proposals, such as new liquid gas terminals to allow Germany to import gas from other countries such as Qatar and the US, are the same ones under discussion now, which shows how little actual diversification was achieved. When I spoke to a Qatari energy official last month, he recounted how they spent five years trying to break into the German energy market, only to find their route blocked at every turn.
Some German sanctions on Russia continued for many years, but the advocates of change through trade gradually re-established their ground. It seemed nothing Russia could do would shake their confidence. On 4 September 2015, at the Vladivostok economic forum, with Putin in attendance, an agreement was signed for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed, which would vastly increase Germany’s reliance on Russian natural gas. Gazprom would also take over Germany’s gas storage business, thereby handing control of German energy reserves to a foreign power.
Various theories – some grubby, some metaphysical – have been proposed to explain Germany’s dogged refusal to see the dangers in its dependency on Russia. One argument places the blame on SPD politicians and civil servants who were allowed to move seamlessly between public office and Putin’s employment, and worked hard to manipulate the EU and German regulatory environment to suit Gazprom.
Then there is the question of the German-Russian industrial lobby, as symbolised by the German-Russian Forum, which was closely linked with, and partly funded by, German companies active in Russia. (The Forum was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine.) Its board of trustees consisted mainly of business people, often with economic interests in Russia. Its chairman, Matthias Platzeck, the former SPD minister president of Brandenburg, seemed genuinely shocked by Putin’s invasion: “I was wrong because until recently I thought what happened was unthinkable.”
The historian Sarotte said there is no clear evidence that business had exerted greater influence in politics in Germany than in other countries. Nevertheless, over the years, Russia showed an ability to suborn, and in some cases corrupt, the German political class. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, on a visit to Berlin in late May, called German Ostpolitik a “fiasco”. German rhetoric around the political value of interdependence, he said, crudely boiled down to gaining a competitive advantage through cheap energy.
Thomas Urban, examining the psychological roots of Ostpolitik, pinpoints two emotions in Germany’s relationship with Russia: nostalgia and guilt. He described to me “the memory of Bismarck, who saw the alliance with Russia as an anchor of stability in Europe. But then there was also the feeling of guilt because of the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, with millions of dead. It meant it was difficult to criticise the Red Army or the Soviet repression since to do so means you do not recognise the greatest crimes in history. It makes Germany blind to the black side of the Soviet Union. It also permits Putin’s propaganda by talking only of the Russian war dead, and not those that were killed in Ukraine and Belarus.”
Much of Germany’s belief in trade with Russia was born of wishful thinking. It led Steinmeier as foreign minister, for instance, to look constantly for signs of reform, ignoring foreign office advice that he needed a plan B in case Germany’s faith in Russia turned out to be ill-founded. In 2016, Steinmeier gave a deeply sincere, almost elegiac speech at Yekaterinburg University asking whether Germany and Russia were still capable of listening to one another. He admitted the annexation of Ukraine had been a low point, but hoped dialogue was still possible, urging both sides not to turn their backs on one another.
It was the speech of a man who sensed the tide was going out, and who feared his belief in dialogue no longer matched the spirit of harsher times: “In political discussions, we sometimes hear opinions expressed by people who are not interested in the slightest in understanding others; people who have already made up their minds about the other side; people who don’t even bother reading because they think they already know the answer.” What he described as the “supposed antagonism” between the west and Russia, he feared was becoming entrenched and ideologically driven, running counter to the pursuit of diplomacy and peace.
Now, as Germany’s president and head of state, Steinmeier has been told by Ukrainian officials that his record as the promoter of Russian interests in Germany means he is not welcome in Kyiv at this time. It seems a shame. There would be no need for him to fall to his knees – as Willy Brandt did in Warsaw in 1970, apologising for his nation’s wartime crimes – but he could give a sober reflection on what precisely went wrong with Germany’s eastern policy for so long. For, one way or another, a reckoning is still needed.

In a game of diplomatic cat and mouse, Russia and the west are coming up with similar if sometimes competing ideas for how Ukraine’s badly needed grain can be given safe passage through the Black Sea and on to the world markets. They are also competing to win the battle for world opinion if the plans collapse.
Both sides are busy diplomatically across Africa and the Middle East trying to portray their adversary as the culprit for spiralling food and fertiliser prices. Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, while Russia is the world’s top fertiliser exporter. The World Bank’s Fertiliser Price Index rose nearly 10% in the first quarter of 2022, to an all-time high in nominal terms.
Ukraine’s backlog of 20m tonnes of grain needs to be exported quickly to avoid a further explosion of food prices, and also to preserve the next Ukrainian harvest that currently cannot be sent to already full storage facilities.
That is not possible due to the Russian naval blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa, and Ukrainian floating mines planted to block the port from Russian attack. Russia, in return for lifting the blockade, wants any sanctions on its shipping and fertiliser products lifted. At issue is whether there is a deal to be done.
In what is beginning to look like the main plan, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has agreed to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but not until 8 June, over proposals for Turkey to de-mine Odesa and then escort grain ships through to the Bosphorous along a naval corridor. Erdoğan spoke with Vladimir Putin about the proposal on Monday, and according to the Turkish read-out, Putin was willing to cooperate, on conditions.
Turkey, through the 1936 Montreux convention, is arbiter of sea traffic in and out of the Black Sea, and justifies its refusal as a Nato member to impose sanctions on Russia by pointing to this unique role. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said on Tuesday that food security was the most important question: “We are focusing on this. We are planning to establish a centre in Istanbul to observe the corridor.”
Within Europe, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has taken the practical initiative, discussing the issue first with Joe Biden a fortnight ago then last week holding talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, then Putin and then Zelenskiy again.
The Ukrainians have said they are willing to see Odesa de-mined, but conditions would have to be set on how the Russian navy would not use the clearance of mines as an opportunity for its warships to move closer to the port. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: “We must be very careful, because a unilateral guarantee from the Kremlin is not enough. We need third countries to take responsibility for enforcing the agreement.”
Italy and the UK have offered to undertake the de-mining operation, something that could take a fortnight, but Turkey may be Russia’s preferred choice to complete this perilous task.
According to Draghi, Putin has indicated that he would open access to Odesa provided valid checks could be made to ensure the grain ships were not carrying weapons for use by Ukraine. Unresolved issues also exist about the nationality of the ships escorting the convoy, and their terms of engagement if threatened by Russia.
According to Moscow, Putin noted the “readiness of the Russian side” to facilitate the unhindered sea transit of goods in coordination with Turkish partners.
But Russia also wants in return the lifting of western sanctions on Russian fertilisers, something Draghi says is also being urged on the EU by Africa and warrants a second look.
The US is also showing some flexibility. Its ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US was prepared to give “comfort letters” to shipping and insurance companies to help facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertiliser.
She insisted that Russian grain and fertiliser were not under US Treasury sanctions but that “companies are a little nervous and we’re prepared to give them comfort letters if that will help to encourage them”. She stressed this was not a bargain to get the Russian blockade of the port of Odesa lifted.
At the moment, the UK and the EU may be heading in contradictory directions by coordinating a ban on insurance for ships carrying Russian oil anywhere in the world. Distinguishing insurance for grain as opposed to oil ships is feasible, but could prove a complicating factor.
One possibility is that Rebecca Grynspan, a senior UN official – recently in Moscow for talks on the issue – could help negotiate a draft security council resolution backing the humanitarian corridor, an idea backed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. One western official said: “It is unlikely even Russia could veto a resolution to feed the world simply because Russian demands on the lifting of sanctions had not been met.”
Draghi is not opposed to the UN involvement but has fears about the pace of progress. He said: “It can play an important role in resolving the crisis, but we have a duty to ask ourselves how we can help. How to accelerate, to avoid arriving late.”
However, the UK, Poland and Baltic states are sceptical that Putin will ever agree. Britain backed Lithuania’s proposal for a similar convoy plan, but one that did not depend on Russian cooperation. It proposed a coalition of the willing – not a Nato force – to escort ships.
Egypt, one of the many middle- and lower-income countries heavily dependent on Ukrainian and Russian grain, was mentioned as a possible member of the coalition. The plan certainly seemed to gain favour with the hawkish UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, when she met the Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis. It was significant that Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, made a rare visit to Cairo this week to discuss the grain crisis.
But Gen Mark Milley, the chair of the US joint Chiefs of Staff, struck a cautious note in London on Tuesday, saying: “To open up those sea lanes would require a very significant military effort.” If policymakers opted for it, “it would be a high-risk military operation that would require significant levels of effort”, he said. It is for that reason Draghi, Macron and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, felt that it was necessary to test Putin out.
If none of the sea-route options works, the only alternative is to intensify the use of existing and much more expensive routes that take grain on trucks through Poland to Baltic and Polish ports, or on barges down the Dnieper River to Romanian ports and finally via train to Poland. The option of taking grain by train through Belarus looks impossible due to Minsk’s demands for sanctions on potash to be lifted.
At the main crossing point into Romania there is a 20km backlog of trucks waiting to be inspected. A queue of 100 barges were at the Dnieper River waiting to get to the Black Sea. Only seven vessels were being cleared a day.
Apart from the humanitarian necessity to avoid famine, Draghi regards the risks to the west of spiralling bread prices, in terms of migratory flows, terrorism and political instability, as real and imminent. As one Italian official put it: “We have two weeks left to sort this or we face something very grave.”"

The US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops on to the battlefield, the Pentagon said.
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.”
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory.
Following Joe Biden’s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which will be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and Blinken on Thursday, Politico cited a source as saying.
Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. “Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” Serhiy Gaidai said, adding that a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk, the largest citystill held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. Western officials said Ukraine’s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed is “pretty credible”.
A Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel.
Russia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound.
Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces.
Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.
Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen."

Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe’s security landscape.
The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.
Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack.
“Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published.
“We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together.
“Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.”
Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033.
“Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out.
“The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party.
Participation in the EU’s defence policy will allow Denmark, a founding Nato member, to take part in joint EU military operations, such as those in Bosnia, Mali and Somalia, and will allow Danish officials to stay in the room when EU colleagues discuss defence issues.
EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result.
Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit.
“This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter.
It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies.
Those opposed to abandoning the opt-out argued that the EU’s defence cooperation is hampered by excessive bureaucracy and inefficient decision-making, and that a joint European defence would come at the expense of Nato."

Standing on the steps of Hampden in the late afternoon sunlight, Jim Struthers is wearing the same Scotland top he wore in 1998 – the last time his team qualified for the World Cup – but his heart is with Ukraine.
“It’s a very poignant evening,” says the Tartan Army stalwart, who has been supporting the Scottish national team for nearly half a century, and has come together with other fans to perform the Ukrainian national anthem – led by the opera singer Vasyl Savenko – on the steps of the Glasgow stadium as the crowds stream in for Wednesday’s qualifier.
“Part of you says it wants Ukraine to do well and part says: ‘Oh no, no, no …’ I feel for Ukraine, my passion is football, and this is a good way to connect.”
“It’s like Rabbie Burns,” he muses. “He wrote that the time will come when all will brothers be.”
The plan for Scots to join Ukrainian fans in singing their national anthem inside Hampden as an expression of unity was prompted by the language learning app Duolingo.
“It was one of those ideas that just snowballed,” explains the app’s UK manager, Colin Watkins. A phonetic Latin version from the original Cyrillic script of Shche Ne Vmerla Ukrayina was produced for Scots to practise in advance and fans walking into the stadium will all receive a leaflet explaining the plan “to raise the roof at Hampden Park”.
For the professional musician Iryna Ganzha, who is accompanying the singing on the bandura, a 65-string instrument made only in Ukraine, the significance of Wednesday’s match and show of vocal solidarity is immense.
“This is incredibly important for the whole of Ukraine to see, those who cannot be here, our brave women and men on the frontline,” she said.
“Ukraine is a singing nation, we express ourselves through music, and so the support of the Scottish people standing hand in hand with us and also voice to voice means so much.”
There were around 3,500 Ukraine fans in attendance at Hampden Park, including an invited group of orphans, able to witness their team’s surprise 1-3 victory over the Scots. Ukraine will now play Wales on Sunday at 5pm in Cardiff for the chance to qualify for the Qatar World Cup which begins in November.
Earlier, around the stadium, the usual festival atmosphere was undercut by a pulse of raw emotion. Kostaia waves his flag wildly in time to the folk songs that another supporter is belting out by the car park. She wears the traditional floral crown paired with jeans, like many female Ukrainian fans at the stadium.
Kostaia has travelled from London today: his boss, a Scot, gave him the day off. “Today is very difficult for me because of what is happening in my country.” His eyes are wet. “I want to help but I can’t.”
But the show of solidarity is not reserved for Hampden, as fans came together across Scotland on Wednesday evening.
In the Highland Perthshire town of Aberfeldy, where the community has welcomed 40 Ukrainians since the conflict began, the Black Watch pub is draped in both saltires and the blue and yellow bands of Ukraine for the occasion.
“This is an opportunity to have a bit of normality together,” explains the pub’s owner, Gavin Price, who is also manager of Elgin FC. “It’s been a settling-in process for all of us. It’s a friendly buildup, but when it comes to the football I’m sure both nations wants their team to win.”
Hannah Beaton-Hawryluk, the chair of the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, travelled to Hampden with her son after arranging two coaches to transport fans from the capital to Glasgow.
“It’s a little bit of light relief for people who arrived here, some with only the clothes they stand up in. It’s about being together and celebrating no matter what the outcome.”
Beaton-Hawryluk anticipates that singing her national anthem alongside home supporters at kick-off will be an “incredible” moment. She apologises as her voice breaks.
The association, which was founded in Edinburgh in 1946, has been so busy offering support to refugees who began arriving in February that she only now has a moment to reflect.
“Scots have been incredible from the moment the war started. They have rallied round and put their arms around Ukraine,” she said."
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/01/minnesota-paper-free-new-owner-ukraine;2022-06-01;Proprietor offers Minnesota paper free to new owner so he can fight in Ukraine;"Lee Zion seeks owner with ‘knowledge, experience and drive’ to take on Lafayette Nicollet Ledger, which reaches 100% of residents
For most newspapers, a subscription rate of 100% of the residents in their distribution area would be a success so huge as to be unimaginable. But Lee Zion, whose tiny Lafayette Nicollet Ledger reaches all 500 people in the tiny Minnesota town of Lafayette, says he is throwing in the towel – because he wants to fight for Ukraine.
Zion is offering to give away the weekly publication, which is profitable and free of debt, before he goes off to fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Zion, 54, bought the Ledger four years ago for $35,000, after working in journalism for decades.
“To put out a good newspaper, they have to do what I do,” Zion warned prospective owners in an interview with Minnesota’s Star Tribune. “And that is, do everything myself with only a handful of [freelancers], and work seven days a week and never take time off.”
An advertisement posted in the journal said Zion “wants to leave the paper in good hands. To get this newspaper, entirely free of charge, the next owner must show that he or she has the knowledge, experience and the drive to take on the challenge.”
Zion’s motivation to volunteer to fight against Russian soldiers is complex. Before the invasion, he concedes, he didn’t care much about Ukraine, but he did have strong feelings about the bandura, a plucked string folk instrument that combines elements of the zither and lute and is considered Ukraine’s national instrument.
“It’s a gorgeous instrument. I thought, someday I’m going to buy one,” Zion told the Star Tribune. “And Russians murdered people just for the crime of playing it.
“Sounds silly, but at the same time, it’s so silly that it’s evil,” he added.
Zion contacted a bandura chorus in Toronto who advised him to contact the Ukrainian consulate in Chicago. Ukraine officials told the Military Times in March that they were looking for foreign volunteers with combat experience who would require little training before being armed and sent to the frontline.
“Where I go, that is up to other people,” he said. “They’ll decide whether I’m going to be in a combat zone. They’ll decide whether I dig ditches. They’ll decide whether I’m a teacher. I can be an escort taking people out of Ukraine.
“Maybe they’ll put me into news, because that’s what I’ve been doing my whole adult life.”
Some won’t be sad to see him go. In a 7 March 2019 editorial decrying anti-immigrant sentiment, he suggested that if people with xenophobic attitudes did not want to fight a declining birthrate by accepting immigrants into the country, then women should have sex with him instead.
A letter from Jan Anderson of Lafayette, publicly posted to Zion on Facebook and partially republished by South Minnesota News, called the editorial “disgusting, disturbing, and downright creepy” and called for Zion to leave town: “We are asking that Mr Zion make Lafayette, and the surrounding communities, less creepy again by packing up your wares and opening shop someplace else.”"

Ukraine has promised Washington it will not use advanced rocket systems supplied by the US to hit targets inside Russian territory, as Moscow warned that the move risked a “third country” being drawn into the war.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that after Joe Biden’s agreement to provide Ukraine with multiple-launch rocket systems, Ukraine had “given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory”.
The US plans to supply the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (Himars) equipped with munitions with a range of about 50 miles, but not the more advanced rockets that can fly 185 miles. Himars is light, highly mobile and can be quickly reloaded by its crew.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Saudi Arabia, said the supply of the rocket launchers to Ukraine raised the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such supplies would not encourage Ukraine’s leadership to resume stalled peace talks. “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire,” he said. “In order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever.”
Shortly after the US decision was announced, the Russian defence ministry said Russia’s nuclear forces were holding drills in Ivanovo province, north-east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk.
With Ukraine facing reverses in the battle for Donbas, Kyiv has been pushing hard for allies in Europe and the US to supply long-range artillery systems in attempt to redress the balance for its outgunned and outnumbered forces in a war that has increasingly become dominated by intense artillery duels.
Each launcher can carry six GPS-guided rockets, which can be reloaded in about a minute, and the system is considered more advanced than other rocket systems that Ukrainian forces currently use.
Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, said Washington believed the system would meet Kyiv’s needs. “This is a defensive conflict that the Ukrainians are waging. Russian forces are on their territory,” Finer said in an interview with CNN.
He said there were significant targets that Ukrainians could not reach with the weapons they had, and the rocket system would make a big difference in the conflict in the south-eastern part of the country, where Russian forces are currently focused.
However, there was some scepticism among defence analysts over how significant an impact the delivery of Himars might have on the battlefield in the immediate future, pointing to questions over Ukraine’s ability to effectively deploy it.
Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.
“Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentarily use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.”
While the weapons will close some of the gap, allowing Ukraine to hit further behind Russian lines in Ukraine – in particular allowing it to target command centres – other experts point out that using Himars effectively will rely heavily on the quality of Ukrainian battlefield intelligence.
The promise of Himars represents the 11th US assistance package for Ukraine approved so far and will be the first to tap into the $40bn in security and economic assistance package recently passed by Congress.
The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so their supply would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two.
Philip Breedlove, a retired US Air Force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said Ukraine needed multiple-launch rocket systems.
“These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,” he said. “We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield.”

Under the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme, we have seen many thousands of Britons put their hands up to host Ukrainians fleeing the carnage in their homeland. However, the process to apply has been described by the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, as being “unnecessary, long, [and] bureaucratic”.
The government should realise that there’s more to be gained than the warm fuzzy feeling of a global do-gooder if we prioritise the expedient assistance of as many Ukrainians as possible, as soon as possible.
The combination of EU workers in the UK heading back home post-Brexit, combined with the necessary safety net support provided by the government in the pandemic, has culminated in an unemployment rate of 3.7% in the first quarter of this year. This is the lowest it’s been since 1974, and the first time that there have been fewer unemployed people than job vacancies.
In other words, UK businesses need employees now. And it turns out that there’s an able workforce ready to assist if they could get some help from the Home Office to simplify getting here. They are skilled workers too. In February this year, Ukraine was home to 5,000 IT companies, 290,000 developers, 150 fintech companies, five unicorn companies and startups that had secured $1.68bn (£1.35bn) of funding within the first 11 months of 2021. Before the war, Ukraine was positioning itself as a hub for people adept in digital transformation and business innovation.
Surely prioritising and simplifying the process of applying for a visa for people who are highly skilled and desperately in need of our assistance is therefore a no-brainer?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/ukraine-steel-boss-at-heart-of-mariupol-defence-says-economy-is-key-to-war-effort;2022-06-01;Boss of devastated Azovstal plant: ‘Steel is as key to Ukraine’s victory as soldiers’;"Yuriy Ryzhenkov’s Mariupol steelworks has been stopped, but his company is leading Kyiv’s economic war against Russia
The Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has become one of the symbols of the brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender.
The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov.
“The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via video link from a company office in Lviv in the west of Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view, the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.”
Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion, and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting.
Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets.
It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”.
Akhmetov, who has links to the UK including past property investments in London, has remained hugely powerful under successive Ukraine administrations, both pro- and anti-Moscow, and has swung behind the current government, saying his allegiance is only to Ukraine and that Russian soldiers should be punished, adding that he would dedicate his wealth to rebuilding the country.
Ryzhenkov says he is in regular contact with Akhmetov as well as the Kyiv government, but insists the company is not involved with the “political issues” of its owner. “We’re working as a single team towards Ukrainian victory.”
Before the war, Azovstal employed 35,000 people, producing 9.5m tonnes of steel a year – two-thirds of Metinvest’s output. That has all stopped. Given the scale of the human lives lost, it can be jarring to talk about quotidian business matters. Ryzhenkov raises an eyebrow when asked what Metinvest’s output will be this year, but responds that it will be down at least 60% compared with 2021.
Yet there has been “help from the market” in the form of strong steel prices, which have lessened the blow to the company’s finances, which were in any case in relatively good shape before the February invasion began, with cash balances high. Ryzhenkov says the company’s focus around Mariupol has now turned to providing temporary food and shelter for more than half of the workforce who have already left the city. Metinvest is running a “humanitarian hub” in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, offering medics and psychological help for adults and children.
Yet he estimates that 50,000 of its employees are still working in the country. Two more blast furnaces in Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kamianske to the north are working at about 50% and 60% capacity respectively, with most products going to European markets or ports. Iron ore mining facilities in Ukraine are operating at around 35% to 40% capacity, and a coking coalmine is at about 75%.
Running a humanitarian operation alongside one of the country’s largest businesses during wartime is not something most chief executives face, but Metinvest has had some preparation. It was forced to move its headquarters from Donetsk after Kremlin-backed separatists first invaded Ukraine’s east in 2014 and turn more towards European markets and non-Russian suppliers for fuel where possible. Then, in the pandemic, it implemented remote working for all eligible staff.
The issue is getting the goods to customers. There has been “quite a significant slowdown in the flow of goods”, Ryzhenkov says. Ukraine and EU governments could step in to provide subsidies for transport, he suggests. The situation for food exports is of particular urgency, not just for Ukrainians, but for poorer consumers of imported wheat around the world.
“It is a big concern,” he says. “Logistics is the key bottleneck right now for many Ukrainian businesses. The government is trying to restart the economy, but without resolving these logistical difficulties, it’s going to be very difficult. We are concerned about the speed at which these bottlenecks are being ‘debottlenecked’.” Reopening Black Sea ports at Mariupol and Odesa is “the key for economy restart”, he adds.
Efforts to increase exports via rail are complicated by the different railway gauges used in Ukraine and Poland, so Metinvest has set up reloading centres in Poland and Slovakia to move products more quickly on to Europe-compatible trains. There is a limit to what can be taken by road, and Ukraine is struggling with severe lack of fuel. Ryzhenkov says government efforts to cap prices have worsened the shortage instead.
From the images of Azovstal’s destruction that filtered out – some of them truly extraordinary – it seems like there cannot be much of it left, but the Metinvest boss cautions that the pictures could be “misleading”, with many showing less important auxiliary units, not the key blast furnaces.
The brutality of the battle for Mariupol has contributed to international isolation of Russia. (Ryzhenkov praised Boris Johnson’s backing for Ukrainian victory, saying the UK prime minister was sending a “very powerful message, and we can hear it and feel it”.) Putin’s apparent aim was to control Ukraine, but the invasion has prompted Metinvest and many other key parts of the economy to turn decisively away from Moscow.
The company is even looking at options to produce more steel in the EU using Ukrainian commodities and Ryzhenkov hopes that Russian steel exports will be targeted by sanctions.
Links with Russia of any kind are off the cards for the “foreseeable future”, he says, and Metinvest will “absolutely not” operate from Russian-controlled territory. “Until [the] Russian regime changes, I don’t see how that can be restored.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/luhansk-governor-says-russia-now-controls-70-of-sievierodonetsk;2022-06-01;Luhansk governor says Russia now controls 70% of Sievierodonetsk;"Fighting continues in key eastern city as Volodymyr Zelenskiy says up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers dying each day
Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces were suffering up to 100 deaths and 500 wounded every day.
With fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk, western officials suggested that the city of Sloviansk was the likely next target for a Russian advance that has made gains in the past two weeks, even as the Biden administration in the US announced it was sending advanced rocket systems to Kyiv.
Confirming the latest gains in Sievierodonetsk, a strategically important city in Ukraine’s east, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Wednesday that Russia controlled 70% of the city.
“Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” said Haidai. “Some Ukrainian troops have retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions.”
Haidai also said “quite a few” civilians were sheltering in Soviet-era bomb shelters under a chemical plant in the city, although he said the complex was not likely to become the site of a prolonged siege similar to that of the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol.
Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russian forces had struck a tank containing nitric acid at a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant.
The high levels of attrition on the Ukrainian side, whose defenders have been pounded by Russian shelling, was conceded by Zelenskiy in an interview with the US Newsmax TV channel. “The situation is very difficult; we’re losing 60-100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action. So we are holding our defensive perimeters,” he said.
Joe Biden announced the supply of advanced rocket systems, called Himars, and munitions that could strike with precision at long-range Russian targets as part of a $700m (£560m) weapons package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday.
“We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table,” the US president wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times.
Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces continued to hit northern, southern and eastern districts of the city of Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk, one of two provinces in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.
If Russia captures Sievierodonetsk, and its smaller twin Lysychansk on the higher west bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, it will hold all of Luhansk, a key war aim of Vladimir Putin’s forces.
The update added that Russian forces were regrouping and strengthening their positions in preparation for launching a renewed attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk in Donetsk. Russian forces currently occupy Izium, a city north of Sloviansk.
The expected Ukrainian loss of Sievierdonetsk, however, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said, adding that the war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance.
The average gain of Russian forces in Popansa south of Sievierdonetsk has “averaged between 500 metres and one kilometre” a day in the last month, the official added, meaning capturing the remainder of the Donetsk region in the Donbas would take months more at least.
Russia would have to achieve “further challenging operational objectives” to declare victory on the Kremlin’s now reduced campaign terms, the official said.
That would require taking the city of Kramatorsk, and more of the M04 main road between the Ukrainian-held city of Dnipro and the Russian-held city of Donetsk, they added, and more rivers would have to be crossed in the process.
“Although we see Russia is starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas, I think it’s important to stress that the battle for Sievierodonetsk is unlikely to be the kind of the crux of the Donetsk campaign” the official said in a briefing.
The latest fighting in the east came amid predictions from some analysts that Russia may be overstretched in other areas, including around Kherson.
In its daily update, the US-based Institute for the Study of War noted: “Moscow’s concentration on seizing Sievierodonetsk and Donbas generally continues to create vulnerabilities for Russia in Ukraine’s vital Kherson oblast, where Ukrainian counteroffensives continue.
“Kherson is critical terrain because it is the only area of Ukraine in which Russian forces hold ground on the west bank of the Dnipro River.
“If Russia is able to retain a strong lodgement in Kherson when fighting stops, it will be in a very strong position from which to launch a future invasion. If Ukraine regains Kherson, on the other hand, Ukraine will be in a much stronger position to defend itself against future Russian attack.”
However, a recent limited Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kherson appears to have had only limited success so far. An official in southern Ukraine said Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges to obstruct a possible Ukrainian advance.
Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that Ukrainian fighters had seen “some success in the Kherson direction”.
Russia is concentrating most of its military power on trying to capture all of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.
Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, also cautioned over how much impact the newly announced US rocket systems might have on the balance of the fighting and how quickly they could be effectively deployed.
We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly 🇺🇦 would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive.

This is how the Russian president’s ‘special military operation’ evolved into a bloody war of attrition
WARNING: this piece contains distressing and violent imagery
After months of buildup and numerous denials that any invasion was planned, Vladimir Putin announced on 24 February that he had launched a “special military operation” to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine.
Western analysts expected a quick “shock and awe” invasion, and it seems there were indeed attempts by Russia to directly target the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, probably in order to replace his government with one more pliable to Moscow’s will.
But if Putin expected a quick, easy war with little Ukrainian or international opposition – like his invasion of Crimea in 2014 – he has been disappointed. The war has resulted in sanctions against Russia, Nato membership applications from Sweden and Finland, and rising fuel and food prices in countries thousands of miles from the conflict zone. This is how it has developed in Ukraine.
The war begins with missile strikes across the whole territory of Ukraine. Land incursions come from Senkivka, toward Kyiv, and from Crimea toward Kherson. An amphibious landing from theAzov Sea launches the bitterly contested attempt to take Mariupol. In Kyiv, Russian paratroopers make two attempts to storm the presidential compound to assassinate Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
From central Kyiv to a rocky island in the Black Sea, Ukrainian defiance is steelier than Putin had imagined. President Zelenskiy posts a self-shot video showing that he remains in the capital, and has not accepted a US offer to evacuate. Meanwhile a small group of soldiers on Snake Island responds to a Russian order to surrender with the soon totemic response: ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself.""
The earliest hours of the war had presaged doom for Ukraine as a squadron of Russian helicopters appeared to have taken control of Hostomel airport outside Kyiv, which would have allowed Russia to bring troops and materiel to the outskirts of the city. In fact, the operation was fiercely contested, and by day four the airport has become the front line.
Nearly a week into the war, Russian forces manage to surround Mariupol, a strategically important port city and export hub. On the same day Russian troops assume control of the city of Kherson, giving them almost complete control of a ""land bridge"" between Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and Donetsk, occupied by pro-Russian forces.
By day 10, the main road bridge across the river Irpin, and a Soviet-era dam on the river has been destroyed, flooding a wide area to the west of Kyiv. Thousands of refugees flee across the ruins of the bridge on foot, but Russian forces are finding it increasingly hard to advance in the opposite direction.
Two weeks into the war, the Pentagon reports that a 40-mile column of Russian forces to the north-west of Kyiv has ""moved into firing positions"".  But the column is facing intense resistance from Ukrainian forces. The same day, footage emerges of a drone attack on Russian armoured vehicles near Brovary on Kyiv's eastern side.
With Mariupol still surrounded but presenting strong resistance, a Russian airstrike hits the city's main theatre, where hundreds of civilians are taking refuge.
Ukraine says Russian forces have only three days' worth of supplies remaining, as evidence mounts that the 40-mile column has definitively stalled.
Russia announces during talks with Ukraine in Turkey that it will ""radically reduce military activity"" near Kyiv and Chernihiv. In fact, shelling continues, as Russia covers the beginning of its retreat from the north. In short order Russia abandons these fronts and redeploys some of the units to the eastern theatre. Ukrainian forces entering Bucha find abundant evidence of atrocities.
Ukrainian forces sink Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. Russia initially tries to claim the sinking was due to a fire and choppy seas while it was being towed to port at Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukraine says it has hit the Moskva with a Neptune anti-ship missile. It is an important symbolic victory, but the Russian naval blockade of Ukraine continues
After nearly three weeks of relative calm, during which the Russian army regrouped and repositioned, the Ukrainian government announces that a new offensive has begun in the east. Its initial strategic aim seems to be to encircle the major Ukrainian deployments on the frontline with pro-Russian separatist regions. Fierce fighting at Izyum and on the old frontline near Donetsk becomes a daily feature.
Vladimir Putin issues a public order that the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is to be sealed off ""so that even a fly cannot get out"", but not stormed. The compound is the last redoubt of Mariupol's Ukrainian defenders and of an unknown number of civilians. In practice, attacks continue.
After weeks of speculation that he would use a speech at a military parade in Moscow to claim a victory in Mariupol or elsewhere, Vladimir Putin lets the occasion pass. Defenders are still holed up in the Azovstal plant, and the eastern front is making slow progress. A military flypast is cancelled ""because of bad weather"".
Weaknesses begin to show in Russia's Donbas offensive. A plan to encircle Ukrainian forces using a pontoon bridge to cross the Siverskyi Donets river southeast of Izyum is foiled by Ukrainian defences, leading to substantial Russian losses. Meanwhile Russian forces have reportedly been forced back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, under heavy bombardment since the beginning of the war.
The Azovstal defenders in Mariupol finally surrender, and are loaded on to buses by Russian forces. Ukraine says they will return as part of prisoner swaps, but some Russian officials intimate they may be put on trial.
As the war's 100th day approaches, Ukrainian forces are under pressure in the east. Russia has identified Sievierodonetsk as its next strategic target and is battling to encircle the city; it is not clear how long the Ukrainian side can maintain contact.

In one Ukrainian Telegram group for those who have lost loved ones in Mariupol, its more than 26,000 members have one objective: ensuring the thousands who died during the Russian assault on the port city are given a proper burial, and in many cases finding their remains in the first place.
The number of bodies in Mariupol is overwhelming. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor, estimated that 22,000 died in the two months of fighting. However, a person among several coordinating burials in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed the total was closer to 50,000.
Some of those in the messenger app group know where their loved ones are buried and are navigating the chaotic burial process under the new authorities. Others spend their days scrolling through social media groups for news, and fear they may never find them, while fellow members post photos and videos of grave markers, as well as photos of handwritten lists of the dead, occasionally with burial locations, written by unknown authors.
With the temperatures rising as summer approaches, the odour of dead bodies wafts down certain streets, people who have been in the city told the Guardian.
There are bodies are still trapped under rubble or in flats or buried in shallow makeshift or mass graves – a number of which appear to have been poorly marked or even unmarked. Others were left in the street and rotted, and some may have disintegrated if they were hit directly or burned in a fire.
“I joined the group to let people know that my father had been killed and, I don’t know, to share my grief,” said Mariana. She said she lost contact with her parents who lived in another part of Mariupol when the phone signal was cut at the beginning of March. The shelling had made it too dangerous to reach them before she left with her children two weeks later. Her father was killed putting out a fire and her mother buried him with her own hands next to their apartment building, before leaving herself, said Mariana, who plans to make the journey back to Mariupol next month to rebury her father properly.
Deaths such as her fathers are among a spreadsheet of more than 1,200 people created by members of the Telegram group, which includes information about how they died and often where they are buried.
The cause of death section listed on the spreadsheet evokes the horrors the encircled civilian population underwent: death from hunger, lack of medicine and lack of medical treatment, heart attack, Covid and stroke. Died when their apartment was bombed, bombed while trying to get water, died while putting out a fire, froze to death, shot dead, and died from shrapnel wounds.
The battle for Mariupol was fought over a densely populated city of an estimated 400,000 people. The Ukrainian army sent shells and missiles out and the Russian army’s response crashed back into residential areas, say residents. They say they still want to know why they were not evacuated and why they became “hostages” in a war that their mayor – who fled on 27 February – said would not happen.
As the barrage of bombs made movement almost impossible, the courtyards between apartment blocks started to fill with makeshift graves dug by residents amid the shelling. Some of the grave markers are handmade, others were given to people by the emergency services who took them from a local funeral home.
But sometimes even makeshift graves were not possible. A picture in the Telegram group shows a dead person’s name and date of death scrawled across an apartment door with paint, presumably written by a neighbour who wanted to leave a record for whoever would later retrieve the body.
Yulia, who left Mariupol for Russia as an adult many years ago, said she found out through her former classmates on Telegram that her father had died in his apartment in late March. Her father’s neighbour told her he had wrapped him in a blanket, taken him outside in a wheelbarrow and left him next to their building.
“[The neighbour] didn’t bury him because it wasn’t safe. Perhaps some [emergency] services took the body later because it began to warm up and hungry dogs were running around everywhere. I even watched a video of dogs eating corpses, it’s just awful. I’m afraid to even think about it,” said Yulia.
Yulia wrote to the new city agency that has been set up to identify bodies and issue death certificates. They replied that her father was not on their list of identified bodies and asked her to come to Mariupol to give a DNA sample.
“From their letter, it seems his body will never be identified. I think maybe the neighbour failed to leave any documents with his body,” said Yulia, who says she will return to Mariupol as soon as she can to look for her father’s body.
The new authorities say the burial and identification process is in hand and that each body will be buried separately in a humane manner. But Telegram posts by people burying their dead show the process appears to be rife with problems.
Since Russia declared victory in April, Mariupol has come under the control of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, a Russian proxy authority created to oversee Ukraine’s occupied eastern Donetsk region in 2014.
Videos shot by the Donetsk authority’s TV channels show emergency workers digging up bodies from the makeshift graves and retrieving bodies from the rubble. They say they are in the process of making their way around the city with the aim of burying or reburying all the bodies. The authorities have publicly invited relatives to exhume bodies themselves, but this does not seem to involve supervision.
Bodies are taken to the only Mariupol morgue still functioning, the Metro morgue, to be examined and registered, if the state of the body allows or if ID is found on the body.
Photos of the Metro morgue taken by a Mariupol journalist, Vyacheslav Tverdokhleb, show piles of bodies in the courtyard next to people with face masks. On Telegram, one person who had been there warned others of the strong smell – which, they write, “starts on your approach”.
“It’s like this: you’re queueing to get your death certificate in the yard and there are just piles of bodies next to you,” Daria said, who left Mariupol at the end of March but returned for two weeks in May to bury her close friend on behalf of his relatives.
If the bodies go unclaimed or unidentified for two weeks, the authorities will bury them in graves marked with numbers, according to Telegram posts written by a representative of Ritual, the only funeral home still operating in the city.
As hundreds of thousands have left the city and cannot easily return, many are trying to employ the services of Ritual from afar.
Ritual, a formerly private turned state company of the breakaway Donetsk authority, offers a paid service to dig up or retrieve a body if its whereabouts are known and bury it. This way, as one of Ritual’s representatives wrote in posts on their Telegram channel, relatives can avoid the stench or worse yet, their loved one’s body being lost in the bureaucratic chaos of Metro morgue or buried in a mass grave.
Satellite images from the company Maxar and a CNN report, both taken after Russia took control of the area, show that Russian forces have dug mass graves. The CNN report, and another video posted on Telegram by Ritual on 9 May, from cemeteries outside Mariupol, show that the mass graves are numbered, and probably relate to a database the authorities are said to be keeping.
Daria and one other person the Guardian spoke to, as well as posts on Telegram by those who had been through the process, say that the Donetsk authorities have a database with photos of the bodies and other information left on the body.
But not all the bodies that should appear on the database are coming up. Olesya’s husband died and her child was seriously wounded when a rocket hit their apartment in March. Olesya decided her only option was to take her child to a doctor and she left her husband face-down near the entrance of their building. Now she cannot find his body and does not know if he has been buried. But, she says, his documents were next to him in the pocket of his jacket.
“I think most likely he will be a missing person now,” said Olesya, who said that all the neighbours fled at the same time because their apartment block was burning, along with five other blocks around them.
The Donetsk authorities say relatives can give DNA samples for identification, which in theory indicates that they are collecting samples from the bodies. But a person coordinating burials said they had not heard of such a practice or database.
If DNA samples are not collected, thousands of bodies may never be identified and the scale and truth of what happened in Mariupol will never be known. Ukraine’s authorities accuse Russia of using the mass graves to cover up their crimes.
“They should let the Red Cross in to oversee the process, collect DNA from the bodies and create a database which should be handed over to Ukraine,” said Serhiy Taruta, a Mariupol native, Ukrainian MP and oligarch whose businesses used to employ thousands in the city.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/himars-what-are-the-advanced-rockets-us-is-sending-ukraine;2022-06-01;Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine?;"High Mobility Artillery Rocket System can hit Russian targets up to 50 miles (80km) away, helping to ‘even the playing field’
Joe Biden has announced the US will send advanced missile systems to Ukraine. The new weapon is the Himars multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS: a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles.
Both Ukraine and Russia already operate MLRS, but Himars has superior range and precision.
The M142 Himars system (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a modernised, lighter and more agile wheel-mounted version of the track-mounted M270 MLRS developed in the 1970s for US and allied forces.
The Himars that Washington is providing to Ukraine will have a range of about 50 miles (80km), a US official told reporters.
Himars units carry one preloaded pod of six 227mm guided missiles (the M270 carries two pods), or one large pod loaded with an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) tactical missile. The US will not supply Ukraine with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300km.
With a small crew, the Himars can remove a spent pod and load a fresh one in minutes, without other vehicles helping. The crews will require some training.
The US military already has Himars units in Europe; and Nato allies Poland and Romania have acquired the systems.
Himars will give Ukraine’s forces the ability to strike further behind Russian lines, and at distances better protected from Russia’s own long-range weaponry.
The GPS-guided missiles the Himars shoots have a range about double that of the M777 howitzers that the US recently supplied to Ukraine forces.
At roughly 80km it generally puts Himars out of range of Russia’s own artillery, while placing the Russian batteries at risk.
It also could threaten Russian supply depots, amid western belief that the Russian forces suffer logistical problems.
Some analysts have said Himars can be a “game-changer” in the war at a time when Ukraine forces appear to be struggling under Russian artillery fire.
But others say Himars will not suddenly turn the tables. “The Himars would even the playing field,” a senior US defence official said.
The US president wrote in the New York Times that the advanced rockets will enable the Ukrainians “to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine”.
Yet the US plans to limit the range of the missiles it gives Ukraine to avoid them being used to hit targets deep inside Russia.
“We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden said.
Since Russia invaded on 24 February, the US has been sensitive about taking any action to support Kyiv that might provoke Moscow to take the war beyond Ukraine’s borders.
That has included not overtly backing Ukraine strikes inside Russian territory. Several times Ukraine has used its own rockets, drones and helicopters to hit nearby Russian targets in neighbouring Kursk and Belgorod oblasts.
If the US provided ATACMS, they would theoretically have the ability to strike major Russian urban centres and military bases, including airfields from where attacks on Ukraine are launched.
“[The] Ukrainians have given assurances they will not use these systems against Russian territory,” a US official said."

Joe Biden has confirmed he will send more advanced rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region.
The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, according to two senior administration officials. The weapons package will be formally unveiled on Wednesday.
In a New York Times guest essay published on Tuesday, Biden said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will end through diplomacy but the United States must provide significant weapons and ammunition to give Ukraine the highest leverage at the negotiating table.
“That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine,” Biden wrote.
The package also includes ammunition, counter fire radars, a number of air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, as well as anti-armour weapons, officials said.
The move comes after Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk province, said Russian forces had taken control of most of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk amid heavy fighting.
Gaidai reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible. Street fighting is under way, he said, adding: “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block.”
Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling.
He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February.
Sievierodonetsk is important to Russian efforts to capture Donbas before more western arms arrive. The city, which is 90 miles (145km) south of the Russian border, is in an area that is the last pocket under Ukrainian government control in the Luhansk region of Donbas.
The US decision on rocket systems tries to strike a balance between the desire to help Ukraine battle Russian artillery barrages while not providing arms that could allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war.
Biden said on Monday that the US would not send Ukraine “rocket systems that can strike into Russia”. Any weapons system can shoot into Russia if close enough to the border but the aid package expected to be unveiled on Wednesday would send what the US considers medium-range rockets, which can generally can travel about 45 miles (70km), the officials said.
The Ukrainians have assured US officials that they will not fire rockets into Russian territory, according to the senior administration officials. Biden in his Times essay added: “We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.”
The US deal is the 11th package approved so far, and will be the first to tap the $40bn in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take a week or two.
Officials said the plan was to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles (300km).
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with the west to send multiple launch rocket systems. The rockets have a longer range than the howitzer artillery systems the US has already provided. They would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a distance outside the range of Russia’s artillery.
“We are fighting for Ukraine to be provided with all the weapons needed to change the nature of the fighting and start moving faster and more confidently toward the expulsion of the occupiers,” Zelenskiy said in a recent address.
Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the west against sending greater firepower to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call on Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of western weapons.

Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.”
US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US.
Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.”
President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region.
The UK’s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.”
Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children’s Day.
Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries.
Switzerland’s government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato.
Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”.
Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”.
The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued.
Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague.
A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow.
Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business.
Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU’s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports.

Russian forces have taken control of most of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk but have not surrounded it, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk province has said as heavy fighting continued in and around the key city and civilians were told to stay underground.
Serhiy Gaidai said in an online post late on Tuesday that Russian shelling had made it impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies or evacuate people.
Earlier, the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said artillery bombardments were threatening the lives of the thousands of civilians still sheltering in the ruined city, with evacuations not possible.
“Half of the city has been captured by the Russians and fierce street fighting is under way,” Striuk said. “The situation is very serious and the city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block.
“The Ukrainian military continues to resist this frenzied push and aggression by Russian forces. Unfortunately … the city has been split in half. But at the same time the city still defends itself. It is still Ukrainian,” he said, advising those still trapped inside to stay in cellars.
Striuk estimated that about 13,000 people remained in the city out of a prewar population of about 100,000 but said it was impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling.
He said more than 1,500 people in the city who died of various causes have been buried since the war began in February. “Civilians are dying from direct strikes, from fragmentation wounds and under the rubble of destroyed buildings, since most of the inhabitants are hiding in basements and shelters,” he said.
The leader of the pro-Moscow self-proclaimed republic of Luhansk earlier admitted that Russian and pro-Moscow forces were moving more slowly than they hoped. “We can say already that a third of Sievierodonetsk is already under our control,” Russia’s Tass state news agency quoted Leonid Pasechnik as saying.
Amid mounting concern for the civilians still trapped in the city Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency, which had long operated out of Sievierodonetsk, said he was “horrified” by its destruction.
“We fear that up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire in the city, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity. The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape.”
The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, on Tuesday evening reiterated calls for residents to stay in shelters after he said a Russian airstrike had hit a nitric acid tank, risking the release of toxic fumes. In a post on the Telegram app he added a photograph of a large pink cloud over residential buildings.
Elsewhere on the battlefield, there were few reports of major action on Tuesday.
In the east, Ukraine says Moscow is trying to assault other areas along the main front, including pressing towards the city of Sloviansk.
In the south, Ukraine claimed in recent days to have pushed back Russian forces on a bank of the Inhulets River that forms a border of Russian-held Kherson province.
After having failed to capture Kyiv, been driven out of northern Ukraine and made only limited progress elsewhere in the east, Moscow has concentrated the full force of its armed might in recent days on Sievierodonetsk.
Victory there and in adjoining Lysychansk would let Moscow claim control of Luhansk province, one of two eastern regions it claims on behalf of separatist proxies, partly achieving one of President Vladimir Putin’s stated war aims.
But the huge battle has come at a massive cost, which some western military experts say could hurt Russia’s ability to fend off eventual Ukrainian counterattacks elsewhere, regardless of who wins the battle for Sievierodonetsk.
“Putin is now hurling men and munitions at the last remaining major population centre in [Luhansk], Sievierodonetsk, as if taking it would win the war for the Kremlin. He is wrong,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank wrote this week.
“When the Battle of Sievierodonetsk ends, regardless of which side holds the city, the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will likely have culminated, giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back.”
The latest fighting came as Russia said on Tuesday that it will hand over the bodies of 152 Ukrainian soldiers found underneath the Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, now under Moscow’s control.
Russia’s defence ministry said its troops found “152 bodies of dead militants and servicemen of Ukraine’s armed forces” that it claims were stored inside a cooling unit and that “four mines” were found underneath the bodies.
“The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies of Ukrainian militants and servicemen found on the territory of the Azovstal plant to representatives in Ukraine,” the ministry added.

Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe, after state energy giant Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany.
The intensification of the economic battle on Tuesday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows the EU’s overnight decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports as part of its financial sanctions against the Kremlin.
EU leaders said the ban would immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
Gazprom extended its gas cuts on Tuesday by stopping supply to GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government.
It later said it would also cut off gas flows to the Danish energy firm Ørsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles.
GasTerra said it had found contracts elsewhere for the supply of the 2bn cubic metres of gas it had been expecting to receive from Gazprom between now and October.
Ahead of the late-night talks in Brussels, Denmark had signalled it expected its Russian gas supply to end. However, Ørsted said on Monday that a gas cut would not immediately put the country’s gas supplies at risk.
Moscow has already halted supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria, Poland and Finland, after they refused to pay in Russian roubles.
Gazprom said it had been told by Shell Energy Europe Limited that it would not pay in roubles for gas supplied to Germany. It added that the contract stipulated gas supplies of up to 1.2bn cubic metres per year.
Gazprom said Shell and Ørsted had failed to pay for gas deliveries by the end of the working day on May 31, and would stop deliveries until they paid in line with Russian demands.
The Kremlin had demanded payments for exports in roubles earlier in the spring, after the country’s currency fell off a cliff after the invasion of Ukraine and Russia was excluded from the Swift international bank messaging system in earlier rounds of sanctions.
The EU’s energy commissioner had previously said that member states would have to reject Moscow’s demands, as the mechanism set out by Russia would have breached the bloc’s sanctions, even if this left them without alternative gas supply.
Supply cuts have pushed already high gas prices even higher, contributing to soaring inflation, and also putting pressure on European governments and companies to find alternative supplies and infrastructure, including storage facilities.
The EU has faced criticism over the past weeks for not going far enough in its sanctions against Russia. Ahead of Monday’s summit in Brussels, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin.
Under a compromise plan from the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for use by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.
Despite this agreement, Estonia’s prime minister has called on the EU to go further and work on a seventh round of sanctions against Russia, which would include restrictions on gas imports.
However, Kaja Kallas said she was not confident this would happen. “I think that gas has to be in the seventh package but I am realistic as well,” Kallas told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks in Brussels. “I don’t think it will be there.”"

An airstrike has hit a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, a city in east Ukraine, Ukrainian officials wrote on Telegram late on Tuesday. Residents were urged not to come out of hiding due to toxic fumes.
Ukraine welcomed EU sanctions, but criticised the “unacceptable” delay. Speaking alongside Slovakia’s president, Zuzana Čaputová, in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, noted that 50 days have passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages.
Ukraine is working on an international United Nations-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia is playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”.
Ukraine’s giant seed bank near battlefields is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing from Russian forces.
The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risks “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continue.
Ukraine is to prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. It was announced on Tuesday as representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes and international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, met at The Hague.
A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. In an interview late on Monday, Oleg Morozov, first elected to the Russian parliament in 1993 and a member of the dominant United Russia party, said on Rossiya-1 state TV he has a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister will travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow.
Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president Dmitry Medvedev has claimed. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security matters, said in a post on Telegram on Tuesday that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have incurred losses for big business.
Ukraine is still in control of some parts of Sievierodonetsk city. Its soldiers are fighting slowly advancing Russian troops, but civilian evacuations are not currently possible, the head of the city’s administration has said. Russians now control “around half”, according to reports on national television in Ukraine."

EU leaders suggested Russian gas was unlikely to be part of the next round of sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine, hours after agreeing a historic but incomplete oil embargo.
After nearly a month of wrangling, the EU agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year, with an exemption for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. These landlocked central European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil, can continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for an indeterminate period.
Following the oil embargo, a measure that would have been unthinkable six months ago, Baltic leaders called for talks on further sanctions. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said the EU needed to start discussing its next sanctions against Russia because things were “not going any better” in Ukraine. “As long as the war is going on, there is no peace, Ukraine hasn’t won the war; we haven’t done enough.”
The Estonian PM, like her counterparts in the Baltic states and Poland, wants the EU to phase out Russian gas quickly. But Kallas said she was “realistic” and did not expect to see gas in the next set of sanctions. “Gas is of course much more difficult than oil already was,” she told reporters on the second day of an EU summit. “All the next sanctions will be more difficult, because so far they have only hurt Russians, but now they are also having effects on Europeans and that is why it is also much more politically difficult to decide.”
Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said gas could not be part of the EU’s next set of sanctions. “Russian oil is much easier to compensate [for] … gas is completely different, which is why a gas embargo will not be an issue in the next sanctions package,” he said.
The oil embargo was agreed at a special EU summit on Monday, after Hungary gained a guarantee that it could get access to seaborne oil, if Russian supplies via the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through war-torn Ukraine, were cut off.
In a message on Facebook, Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, said he had secured an exemption from the oil embargo that he likened to an “atomic bomb” hitting the Hungarian economy.
“Families can sleep peacefully tonight, we kept out the most hair-raising idea,” Orbán said.
EU leaders played down the row with Hungary, currently embroiled in a long-running stand-off with Brussels over the rule of law and its access to EU cash. “The important thing is that we are all together, we are united,” said Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš.
The Ukrainian foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed the partial block on Russian oil imports. “The oil embargo will speed up the countdown to the collapse of the Russian economy and war machine,” Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement, estimating the ban could cost Russia tens of billions of dollars.
He praised the EU for “not only making it harder for the Kremlin to finance the aggression but also shoring up its own energy security”, though a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier given a withering assessment of EU support for his country. “Russia must not win, but we won’t give heavy weapons – it may offend [Russia]. Putin must lose, but let’s not impose new sanctions. Millions will starve, but we’re not ready for military convoys with grain. Rising prices are not the worst that awaits a democratic world with such a policy,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.
Zelenskiy addressed EU leaders by video link on Monday, urging them to unite because disputes “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”.
Ending the dispute over the oil embargo allows the EU to move ahead with other restrictions in the package, targeting Russian banks and individuals close to the Kremlin. Three more Russian banks, including the country’s largest lender, Sberbank, are to be removed from the Swift international bank messaging system, a move that isolates them from global finance. Three state-owned broadcasters will be banned from the EU.
The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the sanctions agreement – “late as always … but a reasonable way out of the discussion”. He predicted that Russia would be forced to lower the price of its oil. “We are the most important client for Russia. They will have to look for another one and certainly they will have to decrease the price.” Some economists have suggested, however, that Russia could gain in the short-term rising prices caused by the oil embargo.
At the start of the war, the EU was paying Russia around €1bn a day for energy imports. The bloc has now agreed to phase out coal by mid-August, and most oil by the end of the year, but has not set a date for gas.
EU leaders also suggested energy sanctions had gone far enough, arguing that gas was already dealt with under a European Commission plan on phasing out Russian fossil fuels. Known in Brussels as RepowerEU, that plan calls for an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for ending Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to renewable power.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters that Russian fossil fuels had been “clearly addressed” by a coming ban on coal, oil and the RepowerEU plan. “The big bulk on energy this is up and running,” she said.
Asked about further sanctions, she said it was important to tackle attempts by Russia to circumvent EU energy and financial sanctions. “Therefore, I would not exclude that over and over we have to address the situation that we close loopholes.
“These sanctions are biting hard and are really destroying … the financial basis of Putin leading this war,” she said."

In the lead-up to this week’s European Union summit in Brussels, Germany’s economy minister and deputy chancellor, Robert Habeck, warned that unity over sanctions on Russia was “starting to crumble”. If that assessment was intended to galvanise EU leaders at a crucial moment, it appears to have just about done its job.
The partial embargo on Russian oil imports agreed at the summit on Monday night constitutes a significant, if belated, ratcheting up of economic pressure on Vladimir Putin’s regime. After a month of negotiations between member states, objections from Hungary were finally overcome through a temporary exemption for oil transported through a Soviet-era pipeline to central Europe. Given that Germany and Poland will forgo imports from this source, by the end of the year the embargo should cover over 90% of Russian oil supplies to Europe. The effect of the ban over time, and combined with other sanctions, will be to deprive Moscow of funds and means to prosecute a prolonged war of attrition that it did not anticipate having to fight.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, was therefore justified in describing the oil embargo as a show of unity and a “landmark” agreement. An announcement of €9bn in economic aid to Ukraine was also welcome, although it should only be seen as a start. The Kyiv School of Economics has calculated that the war is causing about $4.5bn worth of damage to civilian infrastructure every week. The costs of postwar reconstruction could run into hundreds of billions of dollars.
However, financing that colossal challenge is tomorrow’s task. In the shorter term – as it attempts to intensify the financial squeeze on Mr Putin – the west must give Ukraine the military assistance it needs to resist Russian forces, while continuing to avoid moves that risk escalating and widening the war. In May, Washington committed to a $40bn package to aid Ukraine’s war effort, and the supply of US weapons is accelerating – including vital artillery capability. European countries need to up the pace of their own contributions, as the Kremlin attempts to concentrate overwhelming force in the east and annexe new territory. But the US president, Joe Biden, was right this week to rule out sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine which could be deployed to hit targets inside Russia. Moscow’s nuclear capability – and the threatening rhetoric intermittently deployed in relation to it – must necessarily inform the west’s strategic calculations, however enraging that may be.
The goal, as Mr Putin’s appalling war of choice continues, must be that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people are enabled to negotiate its end from a position of strength and dignity. If this is to be achieved, it will be through a combination of economic pressure on Moscow and military resistance. Russia’s armed forces are being steadily and damagingly depleted, even as incremental territorial gains are made. Around 1,000 tanks may have been lost on the battlefield, while two of Russia’s tank manufacturers have reportedly ceased production due to a lack of parts.
Thus far, Mr Putin has shown total disregard for the human cost of his invasion, now measured in tens of thousands of lost lives. But the cumulative impact of sanctions can set logistical limits to his brutal revanchist ambitions. This week’s oil embargo is an important step in that direction."

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/plea-for-heavy-weapons-ukraine-frontline-mykolaiv;2022-05-31;‘The west can change the outcome’: plea for heavy weapons on Ukraine frontline;"People under constant fire in southern city of Mykolaiv say they can beat Russia with more help
A stack of deadly weapons line the corridor next to Roman Kostenko’s office in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. Giant tube-like Javelin missiles and a powerful-looking green cylinder. “That’s an NLAW anti-tank weapon supplied by Britain,” Kostenko – a member of Ukraine’s parliament and a special forces commander – explained. “We’ve used it.”
When Russia invaded on 24 February, Kostenko was in Kyiv. He swapped his politician’s outfit of suit and tie for a uniform and hurried to Mykolaiv on the southern frontline. By this point Russian troops had practically encircled the city and its port on the Bug River. They had seized Mykolaiv’s airport and were advancing from the north-east. “I was the last car in,” he said.
Citizens were piling up tyres and making molotov cocktails in preparation for street-to-street fighting. The Ukrainian army, however, managed to push the Russians back. Kostenko showed off a video he took of a Russian position on Mykolaiv’s outskirts. There were bodies of enemy soldiers killed in a Ukrainian artillery strike, as well as abandoned field guns and vehicles.
Since this failed incursion the fighting has turned into a “war of rockets and artillery”, Kostenko said. The frontline in the south runs approximately along the administrative border between Russian-occupied Kherson oblast and Mykolaiv, 12 miles (20km) to the north. It is a shimmering landscape of green wheat fields and steppe villages, now under constant fire.
Russian howitzers are able to target Mykolaiv with ease. On Saturday a missile smashed into a residential block in the city, killing one person and injuring seven. The Ukrainians lack long-range rocket systems that would enable them to fire back, as well as defensive anti-aircraft batteries, Kostenko said. In the meantime they sit in makeshift trenches under fire.
“To survive artillery hitting you 24/7 is very hard,” Kostenko added. The Javelins sent by the US were ineffective because the Russians hid their armoured vehicles in a network of Soviet-era irrigation canals, he explained. “Our anti-tank weapons don’t see them. If our partners give us heavy artillery and advanced systems like MRLS [multiple-launch rocket systems] we can win and take back occupied territory.”
For now, Ukrainian soldiers are only able to make local tactical gains. On Monday they retook a village in north-east Kherson. Kostenko said Russia had plenty of tanks and supplies of ammunition left. The fighting in the south, and in the east where a battle is raging for the city of Sievierodonetsk, resembled the second world war with modern weapons, he said. The Russians, he admitted, had the advantage.
The MP, secretary of the national security, defence and intelligence committee, spent 15 years as a soldier. He was wounded twice in late 2014 while fighting at the airport in Donetsk against the Russians and their separatist proxies. He grew up in a village outside Kherson now controlled by Moscow, where Russian soldiers broke into his parents’ house, looted his parade uniform and took away all of the furniture, he said.
Kostenko suggested Vladimir Putin’s goal was to seize the Donbas and annex Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, making it a “non-sea country”, after he had failed in his original goal of toppling Kyiv’s government to return Ukraine to Russian influence and to demonstrate Moscow’s military invincibility.
A member of the liberal pro-European Golos party, he praised the UK, US and Poland: “We love Boris Johnson. Britain is a country which has clearly stated its position. It stands by its values. It is not afraid of the Russia Federation. We have several British volunteers who are fighting with us. The whole civilised world is fighting Russia, not just Ukraine.”
He was less enthusiastic about Germany and France. “Some of our partners are behaving very cautiously. It’s inexplicable. They are not calling out the enemy. We are fighting totalitarianism,” an exasperated Kostenko said.
Mykolaiv’s inhabitants, meanwhile, have got used to thunderous booms, which shake the city on an hourly basis. For more than a month there was no water after a pipeline was destroyed. Last week a supply for washing was finally reconnected. There is no drinking water. It is delivered to the city, a major shipbuilding centre in USSR times, in large plastic bottles. About 40% of its population have left.
A humanitarian aid point has been set up in a crumbling 200-year-old theatre and concert hall once used by naval officers. There are supplies of clothes, shoes and medicines. Residents fill in a form explaining what they need. Viktoria Veselovska, a journalist working in a pop-up basement pharmacy, said she had no mosquito repellant. “Insects are a big problem for our soldiers,” she said.
Morale among those who have decided to remain in shell-battered Mykolaiv appears high. Olga Pidsosonna, a volunteer and major in the port’s customs department, described the war as “one very long bad day”. “Russia is trying to eat us. But it will break its teeth. We are a very strong nation. I’m proud to be Ukrainian and I’m proud of our army and our volunteers,” she said.
In peacetime 10 cargo ships a day would leave Mykolaiv’s harbour, she said. Most exported grain. Russia’s naval blockade of the Black Sea meant the port was inoperative. A Ukrainian victory should include Crimea, “stolen by the Kremlin in 2014”, Pidsosonna said, adding: “I have relatives in Crimea. They want to be back with Ukraine. They can’t say this openly, of course. They are afraid.”
Few people in this city of half a million expected to find themselves living in an old-school war zone. One person not surprised by how 2022 turned out was Makar Kostiuk, a student from Vladivostok. Kostiuk volunteered in the local office of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. He left the country for Ukraine before Navalny was arrested and jailed.
“When the bombs started falling I was working on my second novel. The explosions made me type faster,” Kostiuk said. Shrapnel landed in his courtyard, punching a hole in the glass on the stairwell. Kostiuk said he had not encountered any anti-Russian prejudice. But his bank cards had been blocked and he was likely to have to leave Ukraine in the summer when his residency permit ran out.
Many shops on Mykolaiv’s main street, Sobornaya, were boarded up. Tinned music played from loudspeakers attached to maple trees. A few people were out shopping and a man in Lycra rode past on his mountain bike. A lot of destruction was visible. An airdropped bomb had flattened the Ingul hotel. In March the Russians fired a cruise missile at the regional administration building, killing 12 and wounding 33.
Nobody knows when the Ukrainian army will be able to take back Kherson, which was overrun in the first days of the invasion. The Kremlin says the area now belongs to Russia. It recently prohibited residents from fleeing and has mined the road leading to Mykolaiv. Plans to hold a “referendum” on joining Moscow have been put on hold because of a lack of public support. “Ninety-nine per cent of the country does not want Russia,” the MP said.
Kostenko gave the Guardian a souvenir: a jagged fragment from a Russian Kalibr warhead, which he wrapped up carefully in kitchen roll. “Victory now depends on our international friends,” he said. “We have plenty of kalashnikovs and machine guns. If we get enough heavy arms Russia will not be able to go any further.” He stressed: “The west can change the outcome of this war.”"

The African Union has warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risks “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises.
Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continue.
Speaking via video link to the 27 EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Sall said African countries had been hit hard by the global food crisis, because of their “strong dependence” on Russian and Ukrainian wheat. The situation was “worrying” for a continent that has 282 million people that did not get enough to eat, he said.
“In the immediate future, we would like everything to be done to release available grain stocks and ensure transport and access to the market, to avoid a catastrophic scenario of shortages and generalised high prices,” Sall said.
Before the war, African countries imported 44% of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine alone grew enough food for 400 million people.
Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports is contributing to what analysts have called a “perfect storm” for global food supplies, as farmers face rising oil and fertiliser costs and the lingering effect of coronavirus labour restrictions. Drought is also threatening to reduce wheat harvests in countries including France, the US and India.
Proposals to end the blockade have been made. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday that he and the German chancellor had put to Vladimir Putin ending the blockade under the terms of a UN resolution. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov will visit next week for talks to address among other things opening a Black Sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports.
The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, warned earlier this month that nearly 49 million people in 43 countries were on the edge of famine. “In many countries we are forced to make the heartbreaking decision to take food from hungry children to give it to starving children,” he said.
Sall said the price of fertiliser was now three times higher than in 2021, while cereal yields in Africa were forecast to be 20-50% lower this year.
He also blamed EU sanctions on Russian banks for exacerbating the problem: “When the Swift system is disturbed, this means that even if the products exist, payment becomes more complicated, even impossible.”
The EU has cut some of Russia’s largest banks out of the Belgian-headquartered Swift interbank messaging system, making it almost impossible to do business with them.
The African Union leader said he supported proposals for the UN to coordinate efforts to release supplies from Ukrainian ports.
Lithuania has proposed that a naval “coalition of the willing” should lift the Black Sea blockade. Under the Lithuanian plan, the UN would call on Russia to ensure safe passage for ships and Ukraine to remove mines from the port of Odesa, a defensive measure to protect the strategic site.
After the talks with Sall, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted: “Russia is using food as weapon of war. Destroying crops, blocking tonnes of grain, risking global famine. EU is sparing no efforts to free Ukraine’s exports over land and exploring alternative sea routes.”
And in a press conference, Michel said opening the Black Sea maritime route “should be the first priority … but we are not certain it will work”.
The European Commission wants to get 20m tonnes of wheat out of Ukraine before the end of July, half of the amount currently stuck in the country. But finding alternatives to sea transport is a huge logistical challenge, as trucks and trains cannot take the same quantity of goods, and face an average wait of 16 days to cross the EU border.
The EU is attempting to help firms create alternative routes, so-called “solidarity lanes”, but senior EU officials have described this as a “gigantic” task. The EU transport commissioner, Adina Vǎlean, said earlier this month that “an astonishing 10,000 barges and almost 300 large ships are needed to carry 20m tonnes of grains” if it is to be exported via alternative EU ports.
Some EU diplomats believe Russia wants to add fuel to the fire of a global food crisis, with the aim of stoking a wave of migration from the Middle East and Africa that could destabilise European countries.
Moscow has blamed the global food crisis on western sanctions. Lavrov, said on Tuesday his country would guarantee “free export of Ukraine grain by ships that are now locked in Ukrainian ports” if Ukraine removed mines from its coastal waters.
He said western countries had created “a flurry of artificial problems” by closing their ports to Russian vessels, a sanction passed by the EU and the UK."

Two Russian soldiers have each been sentenced to more than 11 years in jail after a court in central Ukraine found them guilty of firing artillery at civilian areas.
The verdict after the trial in the Poltava region came one week after another court in the capital, Kyiv, gave a 21-year-old Russian soldier a life sentence – the country’s first judicial reckoning on Russia’s invasion.
The servicemen convicted on Tuesday, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, were handed sentences of 11 years and six months under legislation against “violating the laws and customs of war”.
They were found guilty of firing Grad missiles on two villages in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in the early days of the war. The Interfax news agency reported that both previously pleaded guilty.
It said their legal defence had requested a more lenient sentence, claiming the soldiers had been following orders and acting under duress.
The verdicts this month against Russian servicemen are expected to be the first in a wave of trials. Ukraine says it has already opened thousands of war crime investigations since the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sent in his troops.
Rights organisations have voiced hope that Ukraine’s trials of Russian soldiers will be impartial and transparent. After the conviction in Kyiv of 21-year-old Vadim Shishimarin, the Kremlin said it had not received any information about his case while his trial was under way. Ukrainian lawyers representing the Russian servicemen say they have not been in contact with legal or military officials in Moscow.
Ukraine has identified several thousand suspected war crimes in the eastern Donbas region where Russian forces are pressing their offensive, Kyiv’s chief prosecutor separately said on Tuesday.
“Of course we started a few thousand cases about what we see in Donbas,” the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, told a news conference in The Hague as she met international counterparts.
“If we speak about war crimes, it’s about possible transfer of people; we started several cases about possible transfer of children, adult people to different parts of the Russian Federation,” she said. “Then, of course, we can speak about torturing people, killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure.”
Ukrainian authorities did not have access to Russian-held areas of Donbas but they were interviewing evacuees and prisoners of war, Venediktova told the press conference at the headquarters of the EU judicial agency, Eurojust.
In total, Ukraine had identified 15,000 war crimes cases across the country since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, she added.
Ukraine had identified 600 suspects for the “anchor” crime of aggression, including “high level of top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russian Federation”, the prosecutor general said.
Nearly 80 suspects had been identified for alleged war crimes that had actually taken place on Ukrainian soil, she added."

The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives.
With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue.
While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric.
The Russian tactics that have shaped the battle in the Donbas have also posed a brutal dilemma for Ukraine’s defenders – to hold their ground amid rapidly mounting casualties, or withdraw and risk giving the attackers momentum.
While other parts of the 300-mile frontline in Ukraine’s east lack some of the same vulnerabilities that existed around Sievierodonetsk – which sat in the midst of a Ukrainian salient that Russia exploited – in any future offensive the Kremlin is likely to offer Kyiv the same hard choices, attempting to stretch its ability to respond.
Perhaps the first and most pressing issue – if and when Russian forces fully take Sievierodonetsk – is whether they then attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, after disastrous attempts at crossing elsewhere were targeted by Ukrainian artillery with deadly effect.
Whether or not Russian forces attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River – a natural barrier – at Sievierodonetsk or elsewhere within Ukraine, Russian forces appear to be preparing for a fresh push farther north amid evidence that they are regrouping near the Ukrainian town of Izium to renew their stalled efforts against Slovyansk, rebuilding a railway bridge near Kupyansk to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment to the area.
What is more difficult to assess is the level of attrition inflicted on both sides, and what impact that will have on further offensives and Ukraine’s ability to defend and counterattack.
While the UK’s Ministry of Defence has made much of Russian losses throughout the war – most recently the mounting casualties among junior officers – Russian gains in the Donbas appear to tell a different story, for now at least. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that Ukraine has suffered heavy casualties during recent fighting in the east, largely from shrapnel, and there are reports of equipment and supply issues.
What may well be true is that despite evidence of fresh Russian preparations, the difficulty of the fighting and heavy losses may limit Russia’s ambitions beyond controlling the Donbas, the south and its key coastline.
“After almost a hundred days of war,” Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute wrote in the Times earlier this week, “the Russian offensive in Ukraine is finally beginning to look more coherent, if not yet strategically wise or sustainable.”
Predicting a prolonged war, however, the former Australian general Mick Ryan disputed the notion that either Russia or Ukraine was close to exhaustion in a lengthy Twitter thread examining the current military position and likely trajectory.
“In April and early May, after Ukraine’s victory in the battle of Kyiv, a degree of triumphalism crept into Ukraine war narratives. But as the Russians have shown recently, by concentrating their forces on smaller regions of Ukraine, they can generate tactical victories,” he said.
“Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow against the other. Despite the Ukrainians demonstrating superiority in global influence, strategy and leadership, the Russians keep generating the combat power to attack them in the east.
“Despite the Russians and Ukrainians losing people and equipment in the hundreds (if not thousands), neither are exhausted nations. The Russians have reserves of manpower and equipment in storage. Ukraine has masses of military aid flowing across its borders.”
In spite of continuing Russian shelling around Kharkiv and in the south around Kherson, where two limited Ukrainian counteroffensives have stalled, the Russian objective in both those areas – according to the Ukrainian general staff – is to consolidate defences and supply lines and to disrupt Ukrainian forces where they have managed to advance.
Elsewhere, however, as the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War suggests: “Russian advances remain limited and are unlikely to increase in pace in the near term, particularly as Russian forces continue to prioritise assaults on Sievierodonetsk at the cost of other lines of effort.”"

The lead singer of the German hard rockers Scorpions has revealed he changed the lyrics of Wind of Change because he no longer wanted to “romanticise Russia” with his chart-topping perestroika power ballad, after Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine.
“To sing Wind of Change as we have always sung it, that’s not something I could imagine any more,” Klaus Meine told Die Zeit. “It simply isn’t right to romanticise Russia with lyrics like: ‘I follow the Moskva / Down to Gorky Park … Let your balalaika sing’”.
Instead, he said, his band had decided to change the words to their most famous song during their ongoing US and European tour, which opened in Las Vegas on 26 March, a month after the start of the invasion.
The revised lyrics, projected on to a screen behind the band, say: “Now listen to my heart / It says Ukrainia / Waiting for the wind to change.”
Even though the song was released over a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in December 1990, it is widely remembered as the soundtrack to the era of economic and social changes in the former Soviet Union that heralded the end of the cold war.
Scorpions performed Wind of Change at the Brandenburg Gate on the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1999, and it was voted song of the 20th century by viewers of the public broadcaster ZDF in 2005.
Meine, who wrote the music and lyrics for the hard rock band’s uncharacteristic ballad, said he composed the words on 3 and 4 September 1989, after Scorpions had performed at the Moscow Music Peace festival in mid-August.
More recently, Wind of Change was the subject of a playful eight-part podcast series in which the investigative journalist Patrick Radden Keefe tried to chase down a rumour that the anthem had in fact been written by the CIA, without unearthing any substantial evidence for the theory. In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine again denied that his most successful song had been written by US propaganda officers.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Germany’s political establishment has faced criticism that it has spent too long buying into the implicit premise of Scorpions’ chart-topper, of a Russia ever ushered down a road of democratisation as it opened routes of trade and diplomatic exchange with the west. The threats an increasingly aggressive Kremlin continued to pose to the states that once made up its empire, critics allege, were overlooked in Berlin for decades.
In his interview with Die Zeit, Meine denied that his band, too, had overlooked Ukraine’s plight, pointing out Scorpions had played concerts in Donetsk, Kharkiv and Odesa.
“But as a musician you hold on to the thought that people in wildly different countries, some of whom may look on each other as enemies, react to music in the same way. That was also the case in Ukraine and Russia.”
Hailing from Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony in north-west Germany, the band used to be seen as part of the friendship circle of the Hanoverian ex-chancellor turned Russian gas lobbyist Gerhard Schröder, whose fifth wedding party Meine attended in 2018.
“I haven’t spoken with Gerhard Schröder for a while,” Meine told Die Zeit. “But his behaviour really is hard to understand.” The Social Democrat politician held on to his boardroom post with Rosneft for the first three months of the war before the Russian state-owned oil company announced his stepping down on 20 May.
“If he now gives up this post on the supervisory board, then that is a genuine step in the right direction after a long time,” Meine said."

A consortium of Ukrainian and international lawyers is preparing to launch a mass civil legal action against the Russian state, as well as private military contractors and businesspeople backing the Russian war effort, in an attempt to gain financial compensation for millions of Ukrainian victims of the war, the Guardian can reveal.
The team, made up of hundreds of lawyers and several major law firms, plans to bring “multiple actions in different jurisdictions against different targets”, including the UK and the US, said Jason McCue, a London-based lawyer who is coordinating the initiative, in an interview in Kyiv.
The plan is to use UK and US judgments to seize Russian assets across the globe.
Targets are likely to include the Russian state and private military contractors such as the Wagner Group, which is believed to have been active in Ukraine. But McCue said they would also include business figures linked to these contractors, and to the Russian war effort more broadly. He believes that it will be possible to go after assets that have already been hit by sanctions as well as those that have not.
The class action will be a private case, independent of the Ukrainian state. But according to McCue, they will need access to Ukraine’s evidence and intelligence.
The Ukrainian MP and businessman Serhiy Taruta is supporting the initiative by facilitating meetings for the lawyers and investigators with Ukrainian officials.
Taruta, who is from Mariupol and had investments in the city, lost a large chunk of his business when Russia and its proxy forces took more than half of the Donbas region in 2014. This time he lost friends, colleagues and a cousin as Russia destroyed Mariupol while attempting to occupy it.
“Ukrainians have waited 20 years for the prosecution of [Pavlo] Lazarenko, and now eight for MH17,” said Taruta, referring to a case against Ukraine’s former prime minister who embezzled millions, and to an ongoing case in The Hague over the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight in 2014.
“We need to develop a quicker mechanism [for compensation],” said Taruta. “The normal routes are too slow.”
Ukraine has already begun prosecuting captured Russian soldiers for war crimes in criminal cases, and other war crime cases may later be tried in international courts. But claims for reparations for the war damage are trickier, and McCue said part of the idea behind speedily launching the case was because reparations on a state-to-state level are rarely possible.
“Often when it gets to the negotiations, the issue of reparations is put to one side to focus on the sustainability of peace,” he said.
According to Taruta, individuals who have suffered the loss of a loved one or property or who have been injured will be the primary recipients of the compensation, followed by state and local institutions, and only then businesses. He estimated the total potential claim could be no less than $1tn (£793.9bn).
A number of teams of investigators have come on board to help the team find assets of businesspeople they believe to be complicit in Russia’s war effort. They include Bellingcat, which has been investigating the activities of the Wagner Group and other Russian private military contractors for some years.
“We are closely monitoring the activity of Russia’s mercenary units in Ukraine,” said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat’s executive director.
“We believe that a deep dive into the [Wagner Group’s] chain of command and its links to official Russian authorities would not only help bring justice for the victims and their families, but also will bring more public awareness and transparency on how Russia is conducting this war,” said Grozev.
A key part of the case will involve pleading that Russia’s invasion is not just an aggressive war but also falls at least partially under the legal definition of terrorism, which would make it easier to go after assets.
“All the legal teams from different countries are satisfied that we have what we need,” said McCue. “It’s very solid.”
McCue has extensive experience in similar cases on a smaller scale, the first of which was won on behalf of victims of the 1998 Omagh bombing, in which four men were found liable for the bombing and ordered to pay compensation to families of the victims.
“The evidence was with the police but nobody was prosecuting because of the peace process,” said McCue, who described how the families approached him. “So, we did a civil action, and we won, and we managed to take houses off two of them.”
The Ukraine case, which is much bigger in scale, is likely to operate on similar principles, though it will be more focused on winning financial compensation for people who have suffered the loss of their loved ones, property or businesses.
“The Omagh case wasn’t about money, it was about proving who did it. This case is about money,” said McCue.
He conceded that there would be enormous work ahead to verify and rank cases and create a “victim hierarchy”, and that targeted figures were likely to work hard to move or cover up their assets. However, he said he believed the case had a good chance of succeeding.
“What we know is that if we don’t do this, people are less likely to get something. This increases the chances,” he said."

Mongolia, a squeezed outpost of democracy in north-east Asia, is under renewed pressure from its authoritarian neighbours, Russia and China, to shed its independence and form a triangle of anti-western cooperation in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
The country is doggedly pursuing a path of neutrality, coupled with a policy of economic diversification designed to keep its unique culture and still relatively recent independence alive, according to Nomin Chinbat, its culture secretary.
A Soviet satellite state until 1990, and heavily dependent on China as a market and conduit for its copper and coal exports, Mongolia has to tread carefully. It is three times the size of France but has a population of only 3.5 million, half of whom live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.
So far it has dodged a definitive position on Ukraine by abstaining in major UN votes. However, its governing Mongolian People’s party is attending briefings given by United Russia, the biggest party in Russia – which has been interpreted in Russia as support for the war.
Doubtless all this is a disappointment to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, who spent four of his childhood years in the Mongolian town of Erdenet as the son of a Soviet mining specialist.
Chinbat, a graduate of the University of East Anglia, is a model of diplomacy when she points out the term ambassador was invented in Mongolia. “Abstaining was a decision that our country had to make because of our geopolitical location,” she said. “We have had very healthy and manageable relationships with our two neighbours, but we also have a third neighbour policy that allows us to develop a multi-pillar international relationships with other countries.
“We have survived where we are, and our sovereignty has been respected by our neighbours. But democracy is what will keep us developing further.”
Chinbat, who has been tasked with attracting foreign investment to her country – whether from film-makers, industrialists or tourists – said there had been a generational shift among Mongolians, over 60% of whom are under 35. The outlook of younger people, she said, is less defined by relations with the country’s neighbours and more by Mongolia’s own development.
Nevertheless, if there is a prolonged war Mongolia’s ultimate political orientation may once again be up for grabs, especially if China and Russia genuinely form the long-discussed anti-western alliance, making it harder for Mongolia to play its two powerful neighbours off one another.
One path for the country is to form the third part of a Russian-Chinese triangle, largely becoming a transport hub between the two superpowers, and supplier of raw materials, while the other option is to try to acknowledge the two countries’ economic importance, while exploiting Mongolia’s own mineral resources to diversify the economy and modernise. The visit in May of the UK Asia minister, Amanda Milling, is a sign that Britain and the US will try to coax it along the latter course.
Some claim Mongolia in reality has already chosen the Sino-Russian option, since four days after the invasion it signed a memorandum of understanding to press ahead with the long-planned trans-Mongolian gas pipeline deal. This pipeline would increase Mongolia’s dependence on Russia by taking gas from Siberia’s Yamal fields and allowing Russia to transport gas originally destined for Europe to find a new market in China.
As a landlocked country, its vulnerability to China has been exposed by the prolonged Chinese border closures caused by Covid, slowing a planned rise in Mongolian energy exports to Chinese ports due to be enabled by a network of new freight lines that will cut journey times by a third.
Chinbat said the government had invested heavily in a wider economic policy of privatisation, tourism, climate and rural development policies, which will allow it to diversify its economy over the next 20 years. The plan needs to succeed: in April, young people took to the streets to protest against the impact of inflation on their lives.
Once in charge of one of her country’s largest independent broadcasters, Chinbat said Mongolia would not backslide from democracy. “We have free media and democracy. It is one of the beauties of Mongolia: that we have this ability to have so much different media, from black and white to middle ground.”
Chinbat acknowledged that Mongolia’s culture of ubiquitous citizen journalists operating in a society that is not particularly media literate could be frustrating, but said: “Media should be challenging – that is what I fought for in my period in the media industry. Democracy and freedom of speech keeps our society lively and upright.”
A bigger problem Chinbat identified was keeping younger people committed to the nomadic lifestyle, when parents sometimes want to send their children to be educated in the city.
Chinbat said that at the heart of the nomad mentality was a respect for nature, a skill to survive in extreme weathers and a neighbourliness that means doors are left open in case herdsmen get lost. Mongolian politicians will require all that tact and resourcefulness in the years ahead."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/what-does-eu-partial-oil-ban-mean-for-russia-and-rest-of-europe;2022-05-31;What does EU’s partial oil ban mean for Russia and rest of Europe?;"Ban on seaborne oil aims to cut off funds for Kremlin war machine, but some warn it could help Moscow in short term
After nearly a month of wrangling, the European Union has agreed to a partial ban on Russian oil, with the aim of cutting off funding to the Kremlin’s war machine. According to the European Council president, Charles Michel, three-quarters of Russian oil imports will be immediately affected, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
The EU is banning seaborne oil immediately, which covers about two-thirds of Russian imports to the EU. Oil transported through the critical Druzhba (“friendship”) pipeline will be exempt from the ban, a key concession to Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil.
The EU is confident most Russian oil flows will cease by the end of the year, because Germany and Poland, countries on the northern branch of Druzhba, have promised to forgo its supplies. Countries on the southern branch of the Soviet-era pipeline – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – will benefit from the temporary exemption.
That is not clear. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who has been driving sanctions policy, promised the EU would discuss how to close the loophole “as soon as possible”. Hungary is seeking EU cash to retool its oil refineries that can only take Russian crude. Croatia also needs time to boost supplies to its northern neighbour through the Adria pipeline. EU leaders have avoided giving details on the end date of the exemption for central Europe.
The EU is paying Russia about €1bn (£850m) a day for oil and gas, an invaluable source of hard currency for the Kremlin in funding its war against Ukraine. A sharp cut in those financial flows deepens Russia’s economic problems in the long term. Some economists have warned, however, that it could have the perverse effect of helping Moscow in the short term, as Russia benefits from high prices. The EU’s lengthy discussions have also given Russia time to find alternative buyers.
Motorists and businesses will see higher prices at the pumps, as the embargo feeds into higher oil prices. Governments will find it even harder to manage the already soaring cost of living. After the announcement of the EU oil embargo, the price of a barrel of Brent crude hit $124.10 (£98.59), its highest level since March, although it dropped back a little in later trading. Oil prices have already risen more than 55% this year and are at their highest levels since 2008.
Before the EU had even agreed on the oil embargo, some countries were already considering further sanctions against Russia’s biggest export: gas. Before the war, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas but EU leaders have promised to gradually phase this out. However, Ukraine’s most outspoken allies in the EU, Poland and the Baltic states, think the EU should now put an end date on Russian gas. That step is far from assured and will be even harder than talks on the unfinished oil embargo."

“Ukrainians don’t have to pay!” I am trying to buy three shawarmas in a market in Tbilisi, Georgia, but the street vendor emphatically refuses to take my money. I try to explain, even though I was warned not to say this: “I am sorry, I am not Ukrainian, I am Russian.” The vendor looks at the Ukrainian flag pin on my lapel; he doesn’t believe me.
Before 24 February, I never thought about what it means to be Russian. Now it’s all I think about.
I was born in Moscow and, until recently, lived there all my life. But “I am Russian” would literally be the last thing I would answer to the question, “Who are you?” I am a father, I am a creative executive at a film company, a writer, a journalist, a podcaster, a friend … a Russian? Well, yes, but it’s just the name on a passport that I have, nothing else.
I grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, when people of my generation – or at least the people I knew – thought of themselves as citizens of the world. After my first year at university I hitchhiked across Europe. The only time I thought about my nationality was when I was had to apply for visas. I know, however, that this was ultimately down to privilege. Unlike my friends from Dagestan, Buryatia, Yakutia or North Osetia, I could afford not to think about my Russian identity. With a Slavic face and a Slavic name, I was not subject to the everyday chauvinism that saturates Russian society.
I loved my country, but I never waved a Russian flag at a demonstration or publicly expressed my patriotism – it was just not something that people like me did. We thought about patriotism in terms of politics – if you care for your country you try to make it better. So I tried. For over a decade I went to all the opposition rallies, I protested against injustice. Like-minded people and I tried our best to make our country a better place. But I never fell for the patriotic mantras about how great Russia is or how great it used to be and should be again.
Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union was the first country to launch a man into space? Yuri Gagarin or Sergei Korolev should be proud of that, it was their achievement, not mine. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union won the great patriotic war? My grandfathers fought in it. The war broke them, but they won: they should be proud of that. I know they were. These achievements were certainly never part of my identity in the same way that they are for the “Putin majority”, my compatriots who build their sense of self on past victories to which they are associated only by an accident of birth.
But now these questions do feel important to me. “I am Russian,” I repeat to the street vendor. “But you are with them?” he asks, nodding in the direction of my companions. Maria Belkina and Kirill Zhivoi are the people who run Tbilisi Volunteers – a movement that has already helped thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Georgia. Yes, I am with them. We had just finished buying a car full of supplies – food and hygiene products to be distributed among refugees in one of the Tbilisi Volunteers help centres. “I am with them – but I am Russian.”
The day of the invasion – 24 February – is a day that will be forever seared into my memory. The enormity and the irrationality of the war was like a physical blow. In my carefully constructed social bubble, there wasn’t a single person who supported the war. We felt like leaves, scattered by a hurricane. We still feel like this.
Some of us left Russia and some stayed. I left with the film director Kantemir Balagov. It was past midnight when we were sitting in the deserted food court of Istanbul airport, waiting for our flight to Yerevan, Armenia. Nursing a glass of water, Kantemir asked me: do you think we should stop speaking in Russian? Do we have to be ashamed of our language? That is probably the only question to which I have an unequivocal answer: “No!”
Let me try to explain. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy both speak Russian, but their languages could not be more different. Zelenskiy’s Russian is passionate, emotional and vibrant – alive. The language of Russian propaganda is dead: a senseless pile-up of obscure bureaucratese. The great Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev made a powerful film, Loveless, about an absence of love in everyday Russian life. The Russian that Putin and his cronies speak reflects this – it is deliberately un-alive. So no, we will never be ashamed of Russian: we speak a different language.
It’s not quite the same with our passports. In the line to the border control in Istanbul, I overheard a conversation between a Ukrainian mother and daughter. They were standing right behind me – they were trying to fly back home to Kyiv. They left for a holiday in Turkey before the war and now they were going back to a world in which their grandmother was hiding in a bomb shelter and their father and brother had joined the territorial defence forces. I listened to their conversation and felt an overpowering sense of shame. My Russian passport burned like hot coal in my pocket.
I don’t think I will be able to read any of my favourite Russian books or watch Russian films or TV shows that I loved any time soon. They all have has the same ending now: 24 February and the robotic voice of President Putin announcing his “limited military operation”. Bucha, Irpen, Hostomel, Mariupol … We will have to write new books and make new films. And, step by step, we will figure out what it means to be Russian now.
Back in Tbilisi, I finally convince the vendor to take my money. “You don’t support the war, do you?” he asks me suspiciously. No, of course I don’t. How can anyone support this bloody madness? But while I am very much against the war and against Putin, I am Russian. For some reason, it is important for me to say that. As I am about to leave, he gives me an extra kebab for free.

For many of us, it’s no longer a simple question;"Like others ashamed by the invasion of Ukraine, I have left Russia, my home. We feel like leaves, scattered by a hurricane
“Ukrainians don’t have to pay!” I am trying to buy three shawarmas in a market in Tbilisi, Georgia, but the street vendor emphatically refuses to take my money. I try to explain, even though I was warned not to say this: “I am sorry, I am not Ukrainian, I am Russian.” The vendor looks at the Ukrainian flag pin on my lapel; he doesn’t believe me.
Before 24 February, I never thought about what it means to be Russian. Now it’s all I think about.
I was born in Moscow and, until recently, lived there all my life. But “I am Russian” would literally be the last thing I would answer to the question, “Who are you?” I am a father, I am a creative executive at a film company, a writer, a journalist, a podcaster, a friend … a Russian? Well, yes, but it’s just the name on a passport that I have, nothing else.
I grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, when people of my generation – or at least the people I knew – thought of themselves as citizens of the world. After my first year at university I hitchhiked across Europe. The only time I thought about my nationality was when I was had to apply for visas. I know, however, that this was ultimately down to privilege. Unlike my friends from Dagestan, Buryatia, Yakutia or North Osetia, I could afford not to think about my Russian identity. With a Slavic face and a Slavic name, I was not subject to the everyday chauvinism that saturates Russian society.
I loved my country, but I never waved a Russian flag at a demonstration or publicly expressed my patriotism – it was just not something that people like me did. We thought about patriotism in terms of politics – if you care for your country you try to make it better. So I tried. For over a decade I went to all the opposition rallies, I protested against injustice. Like-minded people and I tried our best to make our country a better place. But I never fell for the patriotic mantras about how great Russia is or how great it used to be and should be again.
Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union was the first country to launch a man into space? Yuri Gagarin or Sergei Korolev should be proud of that, it was their achievement, not mine. Why should I be proud that the Soviet Union won the great patriotic war? My grandfathers fought in it. The war broke them, but they won: they should be proud of that. I know they were. These achievements were certainly never part of my identity in the same way that they are for the “Putin majority”, my compatriots who build their sense of self on past victories to which they are associated only by an accident of birth.
But now these questions do feel important to me. “I am Russian,” I repeat to the street vendor. “But you are with them?” he asks, nodding in the direction of my companions. Maria Belkina and Kirill Zhivoi are the people who run Tbilisi Volunteers – a movement that has already helped thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Georgia. Yes, I am with them. We had just finished buying a car full of supplies – food and hygiene products to be distributed among refugees in one of the Tbilisi Volunteers help centres. “I am with them – but I am Russian.”
The day of the invasion – 24 February – is a day that will be forever seared into my memory. The enormity and the irrationality of the war was like a physical blow. In my carefully constructed social bubble, there wasn’t a single person who supported the war. We felt like leaves, scattered by a hurricane. We still feel like this.
Some of us left Russia and some stayed. I left with the film director Kantemir Balagov. It was past midnight when we were sitting in the deserted food court of Istanbul airport, waiting for our flight to Yerevan, Armenia. Nursing a glass of water, Kantemir asked me: do you think we should stop speaking in Russian? Do we have to be ashamed of our language? That is probably the only question to which I have an unequivocal answer: “No!”
Let me try to explain. Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy both speak Russian, but their languages could not be more different. Zelenskiy’s Russian is passionate, emotional and vibrant – alive. The language of Russian propaganda is dead: a senseless pile-up of obscure bureaucratese. The great Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev made a powerful film, Loveless, about an absence of love in everyday Russian life. The Russian that Putin and his cronies speak reflects this – it is deliberately un-alive. So no, we will never be ashamed of Russian: we speak a different language.
It’s not quite the same with our passports. In the line to the border control in Istanbul, I overheard a conversation between a Ukrainian mother and daughter. They were standing right behind me – they were trying to fly back home to Kyiv. They left for a holiday in Turkey before the war and now they were going back to a world in which their grandmother was hiding in a bomb shelter and their father and brother had joined the territorial defence forces. I listened to their conversation and felt an overpowering sense of shame. My Russian passport burned like hot coal in my pocket.
I don’t think I will be able to read any of my favourite Russian books or watch Russian films or TV shows that I loved any time soon. They all have has the same ending now: 24 February and the robotic voice of President Putin announcing his “limited military operation”. Bucha, Irpen, Hostomel, Mariupol … We will have to write new books and make new films. And, step by step, we will figure out what it means to be Russian now.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/tuesday-briefing-russian-tanks-ukraine;2022-05-31;Tuesday briefing: What Russia’s failing tanks tell us about how war is changing;"In today’s newsletter: Russian heavy armour is struggling to gain ground in Ukraine. Military expert Phillips O’Brien explains to Archie Bland why that matters – for this war and for future conflicts
Good morning. On Monday, Russian troops began to advance into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held in Ukrainian hands. The city is important to the control of Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas. If it falls, that success – achieved at the cost of the city’s ruination and 1,500 civilian lives – will be viewed as grim vindication for Vladimir Putin’s decision to consolidate Russian forces in the region and bombard targets with artillery fire.
There’s something else about the battle for Sievierodonetsk, though: while Russian tanks are moving into the centre of the city, they were not able to encircle it first. Cutting a city off from its supply lines to soften it up is brutally effective, as the siege of Mariupol indicated. So why hasn’t that happened here?
For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, about a compelling explanation that could have much bigger consequences: Russia may be running out of tanks. That’s after the headlines.
Energy | The European Union agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks in Brussels. The sanctions, hailed as a “remarkable achievement”, will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year.
Partygate | Momentum is building for a leadership challenge to Boris Johnson as soon as next week. As three more MPs called on Johnson to go, rebels expressed anger at what they said was a lurch to the right after Partygate.
Champions league final | Uefa commissioned an independent report into chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France on Saturday where some Liverpool fans were teargassed. France’s interior minister admitted access to the ground had been “disorganised” but blamed counterfeit tickets sold to English fans.
Justice | Police and prosecutors have been told to stop the mass collection of personal information from rape victims by the UK’s data watchdog. The information commissioner said police are going on unjustified “fishing expeditions” into complainants’ personal information.
Music | Glastonbury festival announced its full lineup for this summer, with acts including Sam Fender, Megan Thee Stallion and Foals among those added to the bill. Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar had already been announced.
Few assets of conventional warfare are more intimidating than the tank, and when Russia attacked Ukraine, its invasion force of around 1,500 (out of a total of about 2,800) was often judged to be among the most formidable in the world. Phillips O’Brien was never especially convinced by that analysis, and given the accuracy of his earlier assessments of Russian might – in January, he wrote that Russia “lacks the ability to mount sustained military operations and deploy a wide range of military forces at the same time” – it’s worth paying attention to his view of the current situation.
So, what should we expect next in Ukraine? O’Brien believes that Russian advances have largely stalled because the country’s forces are running very short of tanks, and other armoured vehicles. It’s a view he laid out in a Twitter thread on Sunday, and which built on a piece for the Atlantic last week, based on evidence from the eastern Donbas region. I asked him how he reached that conclusion, and what it might mean.
What are tanks supposed to do?
Tanks are powerful, well-armoured, and move fast in open country. “They’re usually used to seize the land between cities quickly and surround an enemy,” O’Brien told me. “In Russian doctrine, you have these battalion tactical groups which are supposed to have maybe 10 tanks alongside 30 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) carrying the infantry.”
The theory – dating back to the second world war – is that tanks allow you to punch a hole in the enemy lines and cut forces or a strategic target like a city off from supplies, softening them up before a final assault. All of that relies on effective air support to neuter the threat that enemy jets and drones pose to the progress of the armour on the ground.
What’s happened in reality?
Nothing which Vladimir Putin will be pleased to hear about. “When I look at Donbas, I don’t see the kind of breakthroughs which you would want to see in modern armoured warfare,” O’Brien said. “You want to get through the line and then exploit the situation by quickly encircling the enemy. What we’re seeing is that the Russians may make a hole in the line, but then they are stopped.”
He points to the failure to encircle Sieverodonetsk, and declining numbers in Ukrainian claims of Russian tanks being destroyed. That could mean a change in Russian deployment or in Ukraine’s ability to attack them. But since at the same time the Russian machine has failed to break through after its artillery has softened the Ukrainian forces up, it is more likely to indicate that there are simply fewer tanks in the fight in the first place.
While exact measures of the scale of the damage to Russian armour are hard to come by, Ukraine has claimed more than 1,300 Russian tanks have been destroyed. The lowest independent assessments are more than 700 destroyed or captured. The Pentagon, which does not appear to have made unrealistically high estimates so far, puts it at about 1,000 – a number which O’Brien thinks is “probably a safe bet”.
“Those are vast losses,” O’Brien said. In its usually reliable defence intelligence update on Friday, the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia was now moving 50-year-old T-62 tanks out of storage for deployment. “These tanks are antiquated,” O’Brien said. “The Russians don’t have nearly the frontline armoured capability that they had.”
Why has that happened?
The military doctrine that sees tanks as all-powerful is pretty out of date, as you might expect given its second world war foundations. There are many examples of videos that appear to show Russian tanks being destroyed by handheld missiles, some of which – like the British-manufactured Next-generation Light Anti-armour Weapon (NLAW) (pictured below held by a Ukrainian soldier shortly after destroying an armoured personnel carrier) – are designed to strike on top of the tank, where its armour is weakest.
Most importantly, Russia has failed to secure the air superiority which is a prerequisite of effective tank warfare – instead finding that Ukrainian planes and drones continue to be able to stop Russian tanks in their tracks. “They’re far more vulnerable than they need to be,” said O’Brien. “They’re not flying air patrols, or close air support. So they’re running into considerable defensive firepower.”
How did Russia get itself into this position?
Because it overestimated its prospects of air superiority, and underestimated the capacity of simple, cheap anti-tank systems to stop it in its tracks. If, as O’Brien has written, “we are witnessing in Ukraine the final war of 20th-century militaries”, we might be shocked that the Kremlin entered such a fight without a clear-eyed assessment of the likely risks – but “dictators on the whole have systems that tell them what they want to hear, and Putin has clearly done that”.
As for the failure of analysts worldwide to spot the same flaw: “A lot of people fell for what we could call ‘the American trap’: because the US military was able to do something, people looked at other militaries, and just view it as a scaled-down version of the US. And that is not the case here. The Russian military is an entirely more deficient beast. The US can overwhelm an enemy with complex air systems and defeat their air defences, it still has the capacity to do these ‘break out’ operations. Russia just can’t.”
What does it mean for the future of this war – and wars around the world?
It’s obviously favourable to Ukraine if the tanks are failing, but as Russia’s grim progress in Sieverodonetsk indicates, it doesn’t signal an end to the fight. “If they’re bringing out obsolete equipment they probably can’t keep going with their current approach for that much longer,” said O’Brien.
“The problem the Ukrainians then have is: can they drive the Russians back? I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a summer of ranged warfare, mostly – more attritional combat with both sides trying to destroy the other’s resources.” That’s why, as the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh wrote yesterday, Ukraine has been pleading with its western allies for longer-range rocket systems.
There is, meanwhile, a wider positive for those who fear Russia’s invasion signals a new era of military expansion around the world. “The one hopeful thing to come out of this is that this conflict demonstrates that going to war is really hard,” O’Brien said. “And it may be that militaries around the world look at it and realise that war is fraught with enormous new risks because of the power of cheaper forces. So maybe people will be less likely to take that risk in the future.”

The European Union has agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, after tweeting on Monday night that sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the ban “will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year” because Germany and Poland had committed to renounce deliveries via a pipeline to their territory.
Michel added that the package also included removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”.
Von der Leyen called the agreement on a sixth sanctions package was “an important step forward” and said the bloc had agreed a “massive investment in renewable energy” in order to compensate for the diversifying away from Russian oil.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, later tweeted: “A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.”
Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. At a summit in Brussels, EU leaders had been attempting to find a way to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Putin’s war machine.
Under a compromise plan that was discussed at the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.
In a press conference on Monday night, Michel acknowledged talk of a lack of European unity, adding: “I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.”
Michel said the European Council and G7 was also ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid its post-war reconstruction and immediate liquidity needs. However, von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”.
The EU had stalled over its latest sanctions against Russia for nearly four weeks since the Von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil by the end of the year.
Arriving at the summit, Orbán said “the pipeline solution is not bad” but insisted his country needed guarantees it could get oil from other sources if there was an “accident” at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. In typically pugnacious style, Orbán attacked the commission for what he called its “irresponsible behaviour” and blamed it for creating a “difficult situation”.
The bloc has come under increasing criticism for slow progress in agreeing the latest sanctions package, the sixth, including from Zelenskiy, who addressed the gathering on Monday by video link.
Ukraine’s president called on leaders to end their disputes, which “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”, according to an extract of his speech published on Telegram.
The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said earlier he was confident there was a “good solution” on the oil embargo. Germany, along with Poland, has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Officials close to the talks say the decision of these two large economies to forgo oil from the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline means the EU oil embargo would cover 93% of Russian oil supply by the end of the year.
As yet there is no end date on the exemption for the southern leg of Druzhba, covering Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.
Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said he intended to warn his fellow leaders not to get “bogged down” in details. “The big picture is that we have to starve Russia, Moscow, of the funds to continue the war,” he said. “If each European country only thinks about itself then we will never move forward.”
Italy, the Baltic states, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries that import oil on tankers had initial reservations about an exemption for pipeline oil that would give an advantage to those countries that can continue to import cheaper Russian oil. But there was growing willingness to accept an imbalance on the EU’s internal market to secure agreement on sanctions.
Beyond sanctions, EU leaders are expected to approve €9bn in emergency support for Ukraine, although there is no decision yet on whether the funds will be low-interest loans or non-repayable grants.
Ukraine will need hundreds of billions to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals, residential buildings and infrastructure. The European Commission has proposed a jointly managed reconstruction body to be organised by Ukraine and the EU, with contributions from international institutions.
As EU talks went on, it emerged Russia would cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. The Dutch-backed trader GasTerra revealed the move after the company refused to meet the Kremlin’s demand of paying Gazprom in roubles. About 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia.
Some EU leaders are already talking about a seventh round of Russia sanctions targeting gas. But some argue the EU rushed too quickly into an oil embargo. “We talked about oil, under pressure from [the] Baltics and Poland before having done our homework,” a senior EU diplomat said. “Under the pressure of this war we have maybe taken some steps too soon and we are now facing the consequences.”

A French journalist has been killed after an armoured evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian and French authorities have said.
News channel BFMTV said in a statement it was “immensely saddened” to announce the death of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, who had worked for it for six years and was on his second tour of the conflict, adding that the journalist and cameraman was killed on the road to Lysychansk.
“Our reporter was covering the ongoing war. He was the victim of shrapnel while following a humanitarian operation in an armoured vehicle on Monday,” the 24-hour news station said.
“He was accompanied by his colleague, Maxime Brandstaetter, who was slightly injured during this strike, and their fixer, Oksana Leuta, who was unharmed.” Leclerc-Imhoff had been reporting from the easternmost Ukrainian-held city, which has come under intense attack from Russia.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the reporter “was in Ukraine to show the reality of the war. On board a humanitarian bus, alongside civilians forced to flee to escape Russian bombs, he was fatally shot. I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.”
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “A little more than a month ago I gave an interview to this very TV channel. It was my first interview to the French media during the full-fledged war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric’s colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24.”
BFMTV said the tragedy “reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been reporting this conflict at the risk of their lives for more than three months now”.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media advocacy group, said over a dozen journalists had been killed while reporting on the Ukraine conflict.
France’s new foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has called for an investigation into Leclerc-Imhoff’s death. “France demands that a probe is carried out as soon as possible and in transparency on the circumstances of this drama,” she said in a statement.
Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that the armoured evacuation vehicle came “under enemy fire” as it went to collect 10 people from the area. There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities, who have repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine.
“Shrapnel from the grenades pierced the armour of the car … a fatal wound in the neck was received by an accredited French journalist who was making a report on the evacuation. A policeman on patrol was saved by a helmet,” Haidai said.
Andrei Marotchko, a spokesperson for the self-declared People’s Republic of Luhansk, told the Russian news agency Tass that it was unlikely Leclerc-Imhoff was a journalist and claimed could have been delivering arms to Ukrainian forces.
“He is not presented just as a journalist, even the Ukrainian media say he was a volunteer,” Marotchko said. “We do not rule out him having carried arms and ammunition to the [Ukrainian] army positions. That’s why he met such a sad fate. I wouldn’t describe him as a journalist because all his activities were probably of another nature.
“He could be described as a foreign mercenary. We can say with certainty he was an accomplice of the far-right Ukrainian forces because we have observed the kind of aid these volunteers deliver. They deliver arms and munition capable of killing civilians.”
Efforts to evacuate civilians from the area were suspended after the death, which came as Russian tanks and troops began advancing into Sievierodonetsk – the largest city in the Donbas still held by Ukraine.
Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remained after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol.
“They [the Russian army] use the same tactics over and over again,” Haidai said. “They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.”
Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces tried to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were trying to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering from the relentless bombardment in basements and bunkers.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk."

A French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, was killed after an evacuation car was hit near the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.”
EU leaders failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided.
Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures.
Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles. The scheme would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt.
In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”.
The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February.
The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv.
Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.”
“Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech last night about the status of Sievierodonetsk.
The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1.
Lavrov also denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day”."

Joe Biden has said the US will not supply Ukraine with rockets that can reach into Russia, in an attempt to ease tensions with Moscow over the potential deployment of long-range missiles with a range of about 185 miles.
The White House has been weighing up pleas from Ukraine – which is losing ground in the battle for Donbas – for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) to offset Moscow’s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery, amid Russian warnings that doing so would cross a red line.
“We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden told reporters on Monday after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware.
The US-made MLRS comes in many different variants, which in turn use a variety of munitions. The longest range can fire missiles up to 185 miles away, but others use rockets with shorter ranges of 20 to 40 miles.
The precise meaning of Biden’s remark on Monday was unclear, but it was consistent with other briefings from the weekend that the White House was willing to provide MLRS as long as it withheld the longest-range missiles.
That was repeated on Monday. One senior US official said: “MLRS is under consideration, but nothing is on the table with long-range strike capabilities.”
The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev described Biden’s remarks as “reasonable” and warned that if his country’s cities had been struck, then Russian forces would “have struck at the centres of these criminal decisions”.
Ukraine appears close to losing the city of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city it had held in the Donbas region, amid a relentless Russian artillery barrage that has destroyed large parts of a city that had a prewar population of 100,000.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged late on Sunday that “the entire critical infrastructure” and “more than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock” had been “completely destroyed”, as he asked for “more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people”.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said: “The disparity in artillery capability is a major factor allowing the Russian ground forces to continue pushing forwards.”
Russian firepower was preventing Ukraine’s forces from massing for counterattacks, the analyst said, adding that MLRS could help Kyiv by “disrupting all kinds of activity in enemy rear areas”.
Last week, Ukraine’s ministry of defence released a video of what it said was the shelling of its positions by Russian TOS-1A flamethrower rockets in the Donetsk area. “Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need Nato-style MLRS. Immediately,” the ministry’s Twitter feed said.
The M270 tracked MLRS, and its wheeled equivalent, the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS), have a far greater range than anything Ukraine can deploy at the moment. Using them could allow Kyiv to hit at Russian targets from further back, although it could expose more of its hinterland to retaliation.
Ukraine began the war with artillery such as Soviet-standard howitzers with a range of about 10 miles, before the US agreed to send 90 M777 Nato-standard artillery pieces to Ukraine. Depending on the shells used, M777s can have a range of up to 25 miles.
Other Nato members may follow the US lead. Ukraine has also been pressing the UK to supply some of its own M270s, with some sources complaining that Britain has been dragging its feet. The British M270 has a range of 52 miles, although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles.
Last Friday Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said MLRS would enable the Ukrainians “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go”. His remarks, a public acknowledgment of Ukraine’s request, fuelling expectations an announcement could come within days.
Briefings from the US have suggested an announcement could come later this week, after Monday’s Memorial Day holiday."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/rumours-continue-about-putins-health-with-little-to-back-them-up;2022-05-30;Rumours continue about Putin’s health – with little to back them up;"Observers point to indicators of ill health from video footage, but others advise against wishful thinking
The rumours have spanned the gamut: Vladimir Putin is suffering from cancer or Parkinson’s disease, say unconfirmed and unverifiable reports, the Russian leader has survived a coup attempt or, as some tabloids think, he is already dead and has been replaced by a body double.
Photographs of Putin meeting top aides are inspected in microscopic detail: is he gripping the table in pain during a meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu in late April? Is his puffy face a sign of steroid use, as former foreign secretary Lord Owen claimed in March?
As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, reports suggest that Russia’s leader may be ill. But that may be just wishful thinking for Putin’s many critics, who appear ready to embrace conspiracy theories of divine vengeance or palace coups for his unrelenting assault on Ukraine.
In an interview on Sunday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was forced to deny speculation that Putin was ill or dying, as the diplomat continued to defend Russia’s assault on Ukraine.
“President Vladimir Putin appears in public every day,” Lavrov said in an interview with French television. “You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his performances. I don’t think that sane people can see signs of some kind of illness or poor health.”
He said he left reports of Putin’s poor health “on the conscience of those who spread such rumours”.
On Monday, Putin spoke with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and chaired a meeting of his security council. Both meetings were held remotely, as the Kremlin leader continues his coronavirus isolation. Aides and world leaders who have met Putin but have not quarantined have been forced to sit at a long table, dozens of metres away from the president.
Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said he believed that Putin was both seriously ill and that he had survived a recent coup attempt, saying only that the supposed attackers came from the Caucasus region.
“He has several serious illnesses, one of which is cancer,” Budanov told Ukrainian outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda. “But it’s not worth hoping that Putin will die tomorrow.” He also claimed that a coup “will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched.”
A former Soviet spy has claimed that Putin has Parkinson’s disease, while New Lines Magazine claimed to have obtained a recording of an oligarch saying Putin is “very ill with blood cancer”. Neither of the reports have been confirmed.
One report from the Proekt investigative website said that Putin is believed to have thyroid cancer or another disease.
The report was based on leaked travel documents that showed that Putin had received regular visits from an oncologist and from two otolaryngologists, whom the outlet said would often make a first diagnosis of a thyroid condition. The Kremlin has not confirmed any reports about Putin being sick, saying that the Russian leader is in excellent health. Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, called it a “fabrication and untruth”.
Rumours of Putin suffering from illness and injury have stretched back for more than two decades and are, to a certain degree, the fault of the Kremlin for closely guarding information about Putin’s health and whereabouts.
Since taking power, Putin has been portrayed as an active sportsman to contrast with the image of Boris Yeltsin as a heavy drinker whose poor health made him an even poorer leader.
But Putin has disappeared for weeks at a time in the past, amid reports of sporting injuries from ice hockey and judo. He recently told an interviewer that he had fallen off a horse early in his presidency as well.
The Kremlin has regularly used pre-filmed reports, often called “conserves”, to make it appear that Putin is in meetings when he is in fact unaccounted for. One extended absence took place during the coronavirus outbreak, when Putin claimed to be in Moscow while reports said he was in Sochi, occasionally appearing in an identical office as if in Moscow.
Since the beginning of the war, some reports have focused specifically on Putin’s pained body language, suggesting that he may have some back problems. A bulky frame has been explained alternatively as the president wearing a back corset or some kind of body armour when in public.
Those rumours gained steam when Putin noticeably grimaced during a meeting with Shoigu in late April. Putin will turn 70 in October and the focus on his health is likely to continue as he ages. But Budanov said he believed that Putin “still has at least a few years left. Whether we like it or not, that’s the truth.”"

We are having a similar experience to Paul Hanlon and Rebecca Shepherd regarding refugees from Ukraine (‘It doesn’t make sense’: Ukrainian teenager left in limbo by Home Office, 29 May). We’re sponsoring a 17-year-old from Kyiv whose parents are unable to travel because of the need to care for his grandmother.
He speaks good English, and his mother has supplied a letter consenting to his travelling and staying with us, yet the Home Office isn’t processing his application. Also, local children’s services won’t do any checks as he’s not eligible for a visa as an unaccompanied minor. We are getting help from a solicitor, but it shouldn’t be difficult to safeguard him and others. My partner is a magistrate and I have had a series of criminal record checks over the years for my roles working with vulnerable people. One can’t help but think it’s all part of the Tories’ hostile environment.David HoareLewes, East Sussex

Julia has been offered a warm welcome here in Wiltshire, but five weeks after applying for visas these have still not been granted. Instead, the UK government required that her baby undergo biometric testing in Madrid, an eight-hour round trip, and now she has to wait until a hard-copy visa can be shipped to her.
Even our MP does not have access to information to sustain her hopes. Julia and her daughter do not deserve to be treated in this way. The process is utterly shameful and shows the UK in a very poor light. Doric Bossom Pitton, Wiltshire

Russian tanks and troops have begun advancing into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine, bringing fighting street by street as the Kremlin’s forces continue to grind forwards in the east of the country.
Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remains after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol.
“Unfortunately we have disappointing news: the enemy is moving into the city,” the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, told Ukrainian national television on Monday.
The Russian army “use the same tactics over and over again. They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.”
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia makes slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining Ukrainian defenders.
The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were fighting to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering in basements and bunkers to escape relentless bombardment.
Local authorities estimated that 1,500 civilians had already died in Russian attacks on Sievierodonetsk, including from a lack of medicines. Striuk said the city had “been completely ruined” and that the number of victims was “rising every hour, but we are unable to count the dead and the wounded amid the street fighting”.
Relentless Russian artillery barrages have destroyed critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of the buildings, and power and communications have been largely cut to a city that was once home to 100,000 people.
A French journalist was killed after an armoured humanitarian evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in Sievierodonetsk. According to local authorities, shrapnel pierced the vehicle’s armour, killing Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff as he travelled alongside civilians forced to flee Russian bombs. The evacuation was called off after the attack.
Having failed to take the national capital, Kyiv, in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and airstrikes.
“They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region.
Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Gaidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child. The two cities sit on either side of the strategically important Siverskyi Donets River.
According to Ukrainian officials, Lysychansk is still under Ukrainian control, while the main road into the two cities has been shelled, but not blocked. The last remaining access and evacuation route, leading south-west towards the town of Bakhmut, remains under Ukrainian control.
The Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to prevent Russian forces from completely encircling Sievierodonetsk, which if it fell could help Moscow to consolidate its grip on the Donbas – large parts of which were controlled by Moscow-backed separatists before the 24 February invastion.
“The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the French TV channel TF1, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own.
Russian forces are also regrouping to resume their offensive further west in the direction of the Sloviansk region of eastern Ukraine, Motuzyanyk said.
“In Sloviansk, the enemy is regrouping to resume attacks in the direction of Izyum-Barvinkove and Izyum-Sloviansk,” he told a briefing.
In the south of the country, the Russian-appointed mayor of occupied Melitopol said two civilians had been wounded by an explosion that she blamed on Ukraine. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which Halyna Danylchenko denounced as a “cynical terror attack by the Kyiv regime” in remarks broadcast by Russian state television.
Meanwhile, the fate of the the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, who surrendered on 20 May, hangs by a thread.
According to Yuri Sirovatko, a pro-Moscow separatist official and justice minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian fighters may face the death penalty.
“The court will make a decision about them,” Sirovatko was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. “For such crimes we have the highest form of punishment in the DNR – the death penalty.
“All the prisoners of war are on the territory of the DNR,” he said, adding that there were about 2,300 soldiers from Azovstal among them."

The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February.
A career diplomat who served as US ambassador to Slovakia until recently, Bridget Brink was nominated by President Joe Biden in late April and confirmed unanimously by the US Senate on 18 May.
Brink confirmed her arrival in Kyiv with a tweet noting that she had visited the foreign ministry to present her credentials. “Our first priority is to help Ukraine defend itself,” she wrote.
The US embassy evacuated all family members and non-essential staff in January and moved operations to Lviv in western Ukraine in mid-February. Immediately before the Russian invasion, the diplomats moved again, to Rzeszów in Poland.
At the time, the Americans were criticised in some quarters for their departure, with widespread scepticism inside Ukraine and in other European capitals over the apocalyptic warnings coming from US and British intelligence that Russia was preparing for full-scale war.
In the end, almost all western diplomats left Kyiv, either before or immediately after Russia launched its invasion.
Since the Russian army was pushed away from the region around Kyiv at the end of March, small teams of diplomats have been slowly returning. The British ambassador arrived at the end of April. The US embassy restarted limited operations in Kyiv two weeks ago.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called the reopening a “momentous step”, in a statement after the American flag was raised at the embassy on 18 May. The skeleton US diplomatic presence that has returned to Kyiv is mainly locked down at the embassy, a large compound in the suburbs.
Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported the Pentagon was considering deploying special forces operatives to guard the embassy.
When Brink presents her credentials to Zelenskiy it will mark the first time the US has had a full-fledged ambassador to Ukraine in three years, after the departure of Marie Yovanovitch in 2019, who was recalled by Donald Trump and became embroiled in the scandal over Trump associates attempting to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate the activities of Biden’s son in Ukraine.
During the buildup to Russia’s invasion, the US embassy was headed by a chargé d’affaires, Kristina Kvien."

Six million households in Britain face the possibility of morning and evening blackouts this winter to maintain sanctions against Russia, as do consumers across Europe. This is despite Europe pouring about $1bn a day into Russia to pay for the gas and oil it continues to consume. This seems crazy. Proposals by the EU to halt the payments are understandably being opposed by countries close to Russia and heavily dependent on its fossil fuels; Germany buys 12% of its oil and 35% of its gas from Russia, figures that are much higher in Hungary.
The EU in Brussels seems not to know what to do. A diplomatic compromise has been raised – exempting sanctions on imports via pipeline, which would spare Hungary and Germany – but no practical plan has been agreed. The real reason is that arguments over the sanctions weapon have been reduced to macho rhetoric. They are supposed to induce a foreign regime to change some unacceptable policy. This rarely if ever happens, and in Russia’s case it has blatantly failed. Apologists now claim that sanctions are merely a deterrent, intended to work in the medium to long term. As war in Ukraine shifts into a different gear, that term could be long indeed.
Sanctions may have harmed Russia’s credit-worthiness, but the 70% surge in world gas prices alone has supercharged its balance of payments. Its current account trade surplus, according to its central bank, is now over three times the pre-invasion level. At the same time, sanctions are clearly hurting countries in western and central Europe who are imposing them.
It is absurd to expect Hungary to starve itself of energy and, as it says, “nuclear bomb” its economy, with no fixed objective or timetable in sight. Sanctions have an awful habit of being hard to dismantle. Worse is to come. Russia’s reaction to sanctions has been to threaten to cut off gas to Europe, further driving up prices to its advantage. It is already blockading the Black Sea ports, from which millions of tons of Ukrainian grain are normally shipped to the outside world. This blockade has seen cereal prices rise 48% on their 2019 base, devastating markets, particularly across Africa. This in turn has increased the value of Russia’s own massive grain exports. Russia has offered to lift the blockade if sanctions are lifted. Whether it means this is moot, but the west cannot be blind to the unintended consequence of its sanctions war.
Nato has been sensibly scrupulous in not escalating the war in Ukraine into a Europe-wide conflict. Sanctions know no such subtlety. Millions of innocent people across Europe and far from its shores will suffer as food and energy prices soar. Supply lines are disrupted. Trade links collapse. The victims are overwhelmingly the poor.
The objective – to compel Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine – has patently not been achieved. Military aid has been far more effective in that respect. But the harm done to the rest of Europe and the outside world is now glaring. The EU should stick to helping Ukraine’s war effort and withdraw economic sanctions against Russia. They are self-defeating and senselessly cruel.

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/30/reflection-review-reflection-vidblysk-valentyn-vasyanovych-ukraine-donbas-war;2022-05-30;Reflection review – a shaken, horrifying outcry for Ukraine – and statement of hope;"Ukrainian director Valentyn Vasyanovych’s enigmatic war drama, set in Donbas, is brutal in its depiction of conflict but also elusively redemptive
Set at the start of the Donbas war in 2014, Valentyn Vasyanovych’s fifth feature, Reflection, chimes horribly with the current mood, grim and exacting as it is compared with previous, more ironic films about the conflict such as Sergei Loznitza’s Donbass and Roman Bondarchuk’s Volcano. It is composed in largely static tableau shots, many of them featuring windows, windscreens and other partitions, implying both the estranged unreality of the conflict taking place so close to civilised life, as well as an elusive redemption sought by the film’s characters.
The first window gets covered in multicoloured splatters at the paintballing birthday party of Polina (played by Nika Myslytska, Vasyanovych’s daughter), child of Serhiy (Roman Lutskyi), a Ukrainian surgeon. It’s a playful allusion to nearby warfare, which Serhiy discusses with Andriy (Andriy Rymaruk), the current partner of his ex-wife Olha (Nadia Levchenko). But when the two men head out to the frontline, they run into a Russian checkpoint and are captured. Serhiy is tortured by fists and electrodes, then forced to assist in the brutalisation of other Ukrainians – including Andriy – by checking their vital signs to see if they are still alive.
These scenes, which contain one of Reflection’s few bursts of camera movement as Serhiy is frogmarched into the bowels of the security outpost, thrust us into a harrowing abyss. Serhiy contemplates suicide in his cell, helps load corpses into an incinerator in the back of a truck marked “Russian humanitarian aid” and is finally forced into a terrible predicament regarding Andriy. Vasyanovych’s unwavering style is the cinematic equivalent of having your eyes prised open, which gives his film the kind of unrelenting horror of Come and See.
The tableau method arguably weighs Reflection down a little in its second half, as Serhiy adjusts to civilian life, but Vasyanovych lets some metaphysical light filter through. While Serhiy is reconnecting with his daughter, a pigeon is killed as it flies into his apartment window; the ghostly smear it leaves behind, like an imprint of a soul, symbolises all at once the missing Andriy, the difficulty of forgetting, and a state of grace that may still exist in the world. Hauntingly enigmatic in its storytelling, even with the highly controlled formalism, Reflection is both a shaken outcry for Ukraine and subdued declaration that hope still lies beyond.
Reflection is available on 2 June on the BFI Player."

The Eurovision song contest winners Kalush Orchestra have auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army.
The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised $900,000 (£713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone and a further $370,000 by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance.
The winning bid for the trophy was attributed to Whitebit, a cryptocurrency exchange, and came in the form of 500 ethereum.
Writing on Facebook, the band said: “You guys are amazing. We appreciate each and every one of you who donated to this auction and a special thanks to the team Whitebit who purchased the trophy for $900,000 and are now the rightful owners of our trophy.”
Sunday’s auction was hosted by Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula. The money is going to his charitable fund, which raises money for the Ukrainian army in their battle against invading Russian forces.
Bids were accepted in cryptocurrency and traditional currencies.
Prytula said there were 31,088 entries into the hat raffle and the winner was based in the Czech Republic.

The stories of four mothers fleeing Ukraine have highlighted the heart-breaking decisions that families have had to make during three months of war.
Families struggled to pack as they were forced to flee their homes. Some brought just a few changes of clothes, toys for their children and medical supplies, not knowing if they would be gone for weeks, months or even years.
More than 6.3 million people, of whom about half are thought to be children, have fled Ukraine in the hope of finding safety in neighbouring countries in the largest displacement of people in Europe since the second world war. Romania has received 924,000.

Iryna*, with her 10-year-old daughter Nikolina*
Iryna*, who is seven months pregnant, had 24 hours to decide whether or not to leave Ukraine with her 10-year-old daughter Nikolina*. As violence engulfed the country, Yevgeniy, a church volunteer, offered to help them cross the border into Romania, but with a curfew to come into force the next day, Iryna had almost no time to make her choice.
She didn’t want to go, but took the agonising decision to leave her mother – who was too ill to travel – her home and her life in Ukraine for the sake of her children. “For my child and my unborn baby I decided, if there’s a possibility, I have to go,” she said. “They have their whole lives ahead of them.”
When Iryna and Nikolina arrived in Kyiv station they found chaotic scenes. Thousands of people were attempting to board westward trains and the one they had hoped to catch was full.

Realising that Iryna was pregnant, the train driver offered them an out of order toilet, which was clean. It was a difficult and frightening journey. “At each stop we were so scared. There were harsh quarrels, so we locked the door at those stops. I said: ‘Nikolina, don’t move’, and we didn’t move at all.”
When they finally arrived in Rakhiv in western Ukraine, Yevgeniy met them and drove them to the border. They crossed into Romania on foot, where they’ve received a warm welcome.
Now they’re living in the region of Maramures with a host family in a flat Save the Children helped secure for them.
Nikolina is settling into her new life and showing just how resilient children can be: “People care for us and talk to us more than in Kyiv. I like it here,” she says.

Mariya* and Denys*
When Mariya* took a call from relatives on 24 February it was like any other morning in her very normal life as a mum and school teacher. It was the moment everything changed. “They told they’d been bombed.” Five minutes later, missiles hit Dnipropetrovsk oblast, where Mariya and Denys* live. “It was the scariest day of our lives,” she says.
She made the “very painful” decision to leave, but only after a friend convinced her it was too dangerous to stay and suggested they flee together. They took the first train they could heading west from Dnipro towards Romania. “We didn’t know where we would live or how. It was a journey to nowhere. I’ve never come here, I didn’t know where I was going.”
Mariya in Maramures, Romania
When they arrived in Romania after a gruelling journey – especially for Denys, who was ill on the journey – they received an incredibly warm welcome. “Romanians are very, very kind. I never heard anything about them, but when I got here, they turned out to be open-hearted, kind and understanding people.”
They’re also getting the support they need to rebuild their shattered lives. “We get food and water. They gave us vouchers for children. We can pay with these vouchers in all supermarket they are worth 200 lei. It’s almost 50 dollars.”

Milena* in Maramures, Romania
Milena*, 22, feared for her life as the sirens wailed and the bombs fell near her home in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast. She lives next to a major gas pipeline and was afraid it would be blown up.
Initially she and her one-year-old baby Bodhan* took refuge in her parents’ basement in Ivano-Frankivsk, but her brother told her Ukraine was not safe so she decided to take Bohdan and her cousins and make for Romania.
Milena organised the journey – where to drive, at what time and how they were going to get to the border.
Her parents are still in Ukraine. Her father stayed and her mother is helping refugees in Lviv. Milena was heartbroken to leave them but felt she had to go for the sake of her son. “My heart is in Ukraine,” she says. “It’s painful to leave my home and country. It was difficult to say goodbye to the men in our lives at the border. We didn’t know if we would ever see them again.
“We packed only the most essential things for my one-year-old – warm clothes, food, documents and laptops. Save the Children have been great – [giving us] food, shelter, cash vouchers.”
She plans to return to Ukraine if and when the conflict dies down.

Vira* with Marta* and Alona*
“I remember the emotions. It was hard to leave Ukraine. No one wanted to go,” recalls Vira*, a mother of two. She faced the same tough choice as millions of ordinary Ukrainians as their homeland was engulfed in violence.
“It was tearing me apart. You want to stay, but you also have kids to protect. My mother asked me if I wanted to go, and I replied that ‘I can’t, I’m torn apart, I have to stay and I have to go.’”
Vira had a good life in Ukraine, working as a nurse and raising Marta*, three, and Alona*, six months. The war took that life away. The enormity of that loss is hard for us to imagine.
The hardest part was saying goodbye to her parents. “They won’t leave, even in a critical situation. My mother [who works as a paramedic] will go to help. [Leaving is] out of the question.”
Vira with Marta
She decided not to tell Marta why they were going, treating it like a big adventure instead. But for Vira, who had never been abroad before, crossing the border into Romania was traumatic. “I had a sort of panic attack. I was afraid of the border, and I didn’t want to leave Ukraine.”
The welcome they’ve received in Romania has helped to ease the pain of leaving. “We’ve had so much support here. They’ve given so much more than we expected,” she said. “Toys, clothes, food, everything. We had all that in Ukraine, but here, the scale of it all, the children looked like they were seeing all this for the first time in their lives!” This is the kind of difference your support makes to families such as Vira’s.

The sharp polarisation between mainly western liberal democracies and the rest of the world in perceptions of Russia has been laid bare in an annual global poll of attitudes towards democracy.
Within Europe, 55% of those surveyed for the Alliance of Democracies said they were in favour of cutting economic ties with Russia due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, whereas in Asia there was a majority against, and in Latin America opinion was evenly split.
Negative views of Russia are largely confined to Europe and other liberal democracies. Positive views of Russia have been retained in China, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The annual Democracy Perception Index, carried out after the invasion of Ukraine, covers 52 highly populated countries in Asia, Latin America, the US and Europe.
Majorities in a total of 20 countries thought economic ties with Russia should not be cut due to the war in Ukraine. They included Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Colombians were evenly split.
By contrast, among the 31 countries that favoured cutting ties, 20 were in Europe.
Although Russian diplomats will point to the findings as evidence that global public opinion does not share western interpretations of events in Ukraine, the level of distrust of Russia in some countries was high.
The countries with a widely held most negative view of Russia included Poland (net negative 87%), Ukraine (80%), Portugal (79%), Italy (65%), UK (65%), Sweden (77%), US (62%) and Germany (62%). Even in Hungary – whose leader Viktor Orbán is an ally of Putin – a net 32% have a negative view of Russia. In Venezuela, often seen as propped up by Russia, the local population has a net negative view of Russia of 36%.
Countries with a net positive view of Russia included India (36%) Indonesia (14%), Saudi Arabia (11 %), Algeria (29%), Morocco (4%), and Egypt (7%).
Despite the mixed views about Russia, strong sympathy was shown for Ukraine. Most people surveyed in Asia, Latin America and Europe thought Nato, the US and the EU could do more to help Ukraine. In Latin America, 62% of respondents thought Nato has done too little and only 6% too much. In Europe 43% said Europe has done too little and 11% too much. In China, 34% said the US has done too much to help. Nearly half (46%) globally said that the European Union, United States and Nato were doing too little to assist Ukraine, while 11% said they are doing too much.
Negative perceptions of China are not as widespread as for Russia. British respondents were the most likely to want to cut economic ties with China if it invaded Taiwan."

A Ukrainian MP visiting Britain has urged the west to supply long-range rockets to her country – and warned without further military help her country risked deadlock or defeat in its war against Russia.
Kira Rudik, the leader of the opposition liberal Golos party, said she was afraid of the three-month long war “becoming the new normal” and that the west would not supply the Nato-standard weapons Ukraine needed to push back the invaders.
“One bad outcome is that this war becomes a stalemate, like a long-term frozen conflict,” Rudik said in an interview with the Guardian. “One of our goals is to make sure that the world does not get used to a war being in Ukraine.”
The MP argued that Ukraine’s “first and foremost need is weapons” because without battlefield success Kyiv would come under pressure to give up territory to Russia, as suggested by the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger – a suggestion Rudik said was “borderline … how do I not say the word stupid?”.
The 36-year-old said she was in daily contact with frontline troops and conceded Ukraine’s military was “not fine; they are under a lot of pressure” as Russian forces advance under heavy shelling in the eastern Donbas region.
“We should not repeat Russia’s mistake of underestimating us. We should not underestimate Russia right now,” Rudik said. It remained possible that as well a deadlock, Ukraine could yet be more seriously defeated, she added.
Ukraine’s army needed multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of hundreds of kilometres, Rudik argued, which are already the subject of intense lobbying by Kyiv – and which could be supplied by the US and others within days.
“We need to let our soldiers on the front fight better and for that we need MLRS systems, longer-range systems,” Rudik said. “We know that there is like no peaceful agreement on this conflict. We will need to win it militarily.”
Capable of firing 12 rockets in a minute, Ukraine believes the US-made M270 MLRS could turn around Kyiv’s fortunes, with Russia currently outshelling it and, under the heavy bombardment, closing in on Sievierodonetsk.
But the rocket artillery is controversial not least because it would give Ukraine the capacity to reach inside Russia. That has prompted warnings from Moscow that a US decision to supply the systems would “cross a red line”.
Rudik is in the UK for a few days where she is meeting MPs in London and Scotland, including Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, part of her first trip abroad since the war began on 24 February.
On the second day of the war Rudik was pictured holding a Kalashnikov rifle, saying she was prepared to use it to defend Kyiv. “Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men,” she wrote in a tweet that was picked up around the world.
I learn to use #Kalashnikov and prepare to bear arms. It sounds surreal as just a few days ago it would never come to my mind. Our #women will protect our soil the same way as our #men. Go #Ukraine! 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/UbF4JRGlcy
The MP said she did not have to use the weapon as Russian forces bore down on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war, but insisted she remained willing to do so if necessary, not least because of the sexual violence the invaders had inflicted on Ukrainian women and girls in occupied suburbs north-east of the capital.
“I have been to Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka since the days of the occupation and I have talked to women who suffered from sexual crimes,” she said. “Honestly, this is probably one of the parts [reasons] why I have the rifle.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/we-need-to-lift-the-blockade-ukraine-farmers-unable-to-export-grain;2022-05-30;Farmers in Odesa sound alarm over blockade: ‘It’s a question of survival’;"Russia has blockaded and occupied all of Ukraine’s seaports, meaning about 22m tonnes of produce is stuck
In a field near Odesa, Igor Shumeyko pointed to where a Russian rocket landed near his farmhouse. It blew out the glass from his windows. Three more missiles fell on a neighbouring plot but didn’t explode. “I was on my land when the invasion started. The Russians think we are slaves. But our guys are going to kick them out,” Shumeyko predicted.
In the meantime, the 42-year-old farmer acknowledged his industry is facing a heap of war-related problems. The biggest is what to do with this season’s crop, currently growing on his 1,000-hectare estate. The wheat is due to be harvested in late June and July. Next come sunflowers in August and September.
Before Russia’s offensive, Shumeyko would load the grain on to a truck. It would be transported 15 miles from his village of Velykyi Dalnyk to Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest commercial port. From there, food products continued their journey by ship across the Black Sea. Ukraine’s grain helped feed an estimated 400 million people. It went to Egypt, Tunisia and beyond.
Since 24 February, however, this maritime traffic has entirely ceased. Russia has blockaded and occupied all of Ukraine’s seaports. It has seized Mariupol and Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov, which is now a de facto Russian lake, and overrun Snake Island, a strategic base, allowing it to control shipping to and from the Dardanelles strait.
Ukraine can no longer export its agricultural produce. About 22m tonnes of food is stuck. Many farmers say they have no space to store this summer’s harvest. Others are building makeshift shelters. Shumeyko says he is running low on fertiliser, which used to arrive through Odesa. His last sacks of ammonium nitrate are stored next to his red tractor.
The UN World Food Programme has warned that millions of people will die if Ukraine’s ports remain blocked. Vladimir Putin has offered to open up a sea corridor but only if the west lifts what he calls “politically motivated” sanctions. He accuses Ukraine of mining its ports. Kyiv says Moscow is guilty of blackmail, with the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, calling on the world to act.
Sanctions on Russia have no connection to the unfolding global food crisis. The sole reason for shortages, rising prices, and threat of hunger is the Russian military physically blocking 22 million tons of Ukrainian food exports in our seaports. Demand Moscow to end its blockade.
The topic is now at the top of the international agenda. In a phone call on Saturday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to persuade Putin to lift the blockade, without success. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he discussed the crisis with Boris Johnson, as well as the related issue of military aid.
The Ministry of Defence points out that Ukraine has deployed maritime mines “because of the continued credible threat of amphibious Russian assaults from the Black Sea”. It says Moscow is falsely trying to present itself as a “reasonable actor”. In reality, it is leveraging global food security in order to advance its “political aims” and “to blame the west for any failure”.

Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said Russia would break any maritime deal to which it agreed, and “sink one or two Ukrainian ships”. He has suggested Turkey and the UK send vessels to enforce a waterways equivalent of a “no-fly zone” in the north-west Black Sea. “We need to unblock it militarily,” he said.
“Ukraine is an agricultural superpower,” he added. “This is our number one problem. It’s a question of the country’s survival. Without the grain, the economy will stop and die out. This isn’t just about us. It’s about the global situation. We are talking about hunger of huge proportions here.”
On Saturday, the head of Velykyi Dalnyk, Denis Tkachenko, met with other Odesa region mayors to discuss the blockade. There were no simple answers. Belarus, the Kremlin’s ally, is unlikely to facilitate road shipments without the lifting of western sanctions. Poland uses a different track gauge to Ukraine, making railway transport expensive.
The Russians, meanwhile, have twice fired cruise missiles at the bridge over the Dniester estuary in Zatoka, in the Odesa region, closing off a vital land route to the south-west and Romania. One small-scale solution is to take the grain to the Ukrainian port of Izmail on the Danube river. But this is costly for farmers at a time when diesel prices are going up.
“It used to be easy. Odesa had big traffic. It was Ukraine’s main port,” Tkachenko said. He described a tentative UK-Turkish plan to create a humanitarian sea corridor as “realistic”, adding: “Putin won’t attack English ships.” His 100-hectare farm grows wheat, sunflowers and strawberries, he said, irrigated by water taken from the Dniester through a network of Soviet-era canals.
In Odesa, the harbour is eerily quiet. The Ukrainian army has sealed off the port area. There are sandbags and checkpoints in the city’s historic centre, with its statue of Catherine the Great, Odesa’s imperial founder. The Potemkin steps – made famous by the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 film Battleship Potemkin – are no longer accessible to the public.
Russia’s apparent plan to storm Odesa from the sea has not yet happened. In the meantime, life continues. Couples, dog-walkers and kids on scooters go up and down Primorsky Boulevard, which overlooks the port. Swifts screech in the sky; the air is heady with the scent of elderflower blossom; a Pushkin statue has the inscription “Odesa resident”.
Taking in the harbour view, the Odesa city council deputy, Peter Obukhov, pointed to a row of giant steel cylinders. These, he explained, were grain silos, filled to capacity. The cranes next to them were idle. Nearby was a rusting three-masted sailing ship, Druzhba, and an ancient ferry. The Black Sea sparkled in the sunshine. It was tranquil and boatless.
The state-owned port and private tug company are the biggest employer in Odesa, with a workforce of 5,000 people. Their salaries contribute to the city’s budget. “It’s very difficult to transfer last year’s harvest by road. We need to lift the blockade,” Obukhov said. He added: “Even if Putin died and the war stopped, it would take half a year to ship the grain we already have.”
The Russians have fired long range missiles at Odesa on several occasions. But it has been spared the destruction meted out to other Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv. One explanation is the Kremlin thinks it enjoys some local support – a view not borne out by polling data and by non-scientific conversations conducted by the Guardian.
Odesa’s mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov, has dumped his previous Russian-friendly position and is now a Ukrainian patriot. According to Obukhov, who ran against Trukhanov, Moscow still plans to capture Odesa and to create a land corridor stretching to Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Russian republic of Moldova. “Putin wants everything. The whole of Ukraine and Moldova as well,” Obukhov said.
In the first days of the invasion, Russian troops advancing from Crimea captured large chunks of southern Ukraine. They include the agricultural heartlands in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Kyiv says Moscow has stolen grain from local producers as well as farming equipment and agri-drones. Satellite photos suggest thousand of tonnes have been loaded on to ships in Crimea and sold abroad, including to Syria.
Hennadiy Lahuta, the head of Kherson’s Ukrainian military administration, said some farmers were cooperating with Russia. Others are not planting or are unable to plant because of fighting. “What can be said for sure is that the Russians are transporting food and grain from the Kherson region. Traffic jams on the road to Crimea are already several kilometres long,” he said last week.
This theft has painful historical echoes. In 1932-33, about 4 million people died as a result of Stalin’s state-engineered famine in Ukraine. Teams of Communist party enforcers went to villages and individual houses, confiscating grain, seeds, cows and vegetables. Peasants starved to death. The famine – known as the Holodomor – had a political aspect. It was designed to wipe out support for Ukrainian independence.
Back in Velykyi Dalnyk, Shumeyko said he would sell his wheat and vegetables on the domestic market. It was a contribution to the war effort. He said he enjoyed his job, which involved spending time outdoors amid a blooming landscape of fields, swallows and wild roses. “A good harvest requires professionalism and protecting crops. When you bring it in, you get a great feeling in your soul.”"

Over weeks of conflict, Yurii Fenenko, a coroner in the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, had become familiar with the way war mangles bodies, charting the damage caused by shrapnel, cluster bombs and bullets.
The 44-year-old dreaded the day he knew would surely come, when the body of someone he was close to was brought in. But he was not prepared for it to be someone he knew so well.
“It was the body of a dear friend and wife of one of my best mates,” Fenenko said in an interview at the weekend, bursting into tears at the memory. “The car she was driving hit a landmine as she was trying to flee a village where she lived near Chernihiv, which had been occupied by the Russians.”
Before the war, Fenenko examined an average of four bodies a day – mostly people who had died from disease, or occasionally in a car accident or gun violence.
Everything changed when Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and Russian forces advancing from Belarus began bombarding the city. By 10 March Chernihiv was encircled by Russian forces, trapping its 150,000 inhabitants. Now Fenenko was examining up to 15 bodies a day.
“At first no one understood what was going on”, he said. “It was scary, you didn’t know what to expect. Then after a few days the first bodies started to turn up in our lab. And the numbers grew day by day.”
Space ran out in Chernihiv’s morgues, which are designed to hold 30 bodies, and corpses piled up in refrigerated trucks. Fenenko carried out his work in a room without electricity because of the bombing. A diesel generator provided dim light.
“Before the war, I had seen bodies completely torn apart by accidental explosions,” he said. “But never in such numbers.”
Fenenko’s postmortem reports are being forwarded to prosecutors investigating alleged war crimes perpetrated by Russian forces in Ukraine.
“Among the signs of torture, we found hands tied behind the back from bodies of people living in the Russian occupied villages, blindfolded, the limbs shot through,” he said. “Another time a missile hit a queue of people standing outside a grocery store. Thirty people were killed that day and they were all brought to my lab.”
Fenenko has extracted hundreds of projectiles and shrapnel from bodies, but also cluster bomb fragments, explosives which are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area. Cluster bombs are banned under international law by a 2008 treaty signed by more than 100 countries.
“You see these little cylinders? They come from a cluster bomb,” he said. “I found them in civilians’ bodies. Some of them explode when they hit the ground and some of them in the air. That’s why they hit lots of people.”
Fenenko said the most unusual thing he had found in bodies was probably fléchettes – small metal darts contained in tank or field gun shells. Each shell can contain up to 8,000 fléchettes. Once fired, shells burst when a timed fuse detonates and explodes above the ground. Once released from the shell, they disperse in a conical arch about 300m wide and 100m long. On impact with a victim’s body, the dart can lose rigidity, bending into a hook, while the arrow’s rear, made of four fins, often breaks away causing a second wound.
Early in April, Ukrainian forces liberated dozens of villages occupied by the Russians. At the end of the siege, more than 700 bodies were recovered from the Chernihiv region. Before abandoning the villages, the Russians placed thousands of mines that continue to cause injuries and deaths, while every day Ukrainian authorities find more bodies buried in the rubble.
As a coroner with over twenty years of experience, Fenenko said he had learned to put his emotions aside before starting an autopsy, but on the day police delivered the body of his old friend to his lab, it wasn’t possible.
“Fortunately, that day, there were two other experts working with me. So I let them perform the autopsy,” he said. “I just couldn’t do it.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/eu-debate-ban-oil-imports-russia-hungary-orban-ukraine-war;2022-05-29;EU debates watering down Russian oil ban in face of Hungarian opposition;"A deal to placate Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, could allow pipeline imports via Ukraine
The EU is debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine.
Senior EU diplomats holding a special meeting on Sunday were deadlocked over a compromise plan that would see the bloc ban Russian oil arriving in tankers but allow pipeline imports, a proposal that would allow Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine.
More than three weeks after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of the year, the EU is stalled on the plans. Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil, has said it needs five years and billions of euros to upgrade its refineries.
The row threatens to overshadow a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, formally dedicated to discussing economic, political and humanitarian support for Ukraine and the crisis in global food supplies.
EU ambassadors will meet on Monday morning in a fresh attempt to find a compromise on the oil embargo. “It might not work, it might work, but I think we have a duty to try it,” a senior EU official said. Excluding pipelines from EU sanctions would protect one-third of Russian oil that comes to the bloc, preserving a valuable source of revenue for Moscow.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is due to address EU leaders via video link on Monday, criticised the bloc last week for its failure to come to an agreement on the oil embargo. “Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia,” he said on Thursday, noting that the EU was paying Russia nearly €1bn (£850m) a day for energy. “Where did those who block the sixth package get so much power?”
When the idea of excluding pipeline oil was floated weeks ago, several member states shot it down on the grounds that it gave an unfair advantage to countries that can continue getting cheap Russian crude. Internal estimates suggest Hungary could benefit from oil 35% cheaper than neighbouring countries. After weeks of stalemate, however, a growing number of countries are looking for ways to break the deadlock.
“To have no agreement or drag things further would be the worst, but to see blackmailing consequences is also disappointing,” a senior EU diplomat said.
The issue has deepened the wedge between Hungary and its traditional central European allies. A senior Polish diplomat said they could not understand the logic of Budapest’s policy on Ukraine and described opposition to the oil embargo as political rather than technical. “They have received everything that is technically reasonable,” they said.
Hungary has been offered a two-year delay in introducing the oil embargo to allow time to retool refineries and establish new oil routes from its southern neighbour Croatia.
Some advise against rushing into a hasty deal as the proposed oil embargo was not envisaged to come completely into force until the end of the year. Others feel the delay sends a terrible political signal as Russian forces appear to be gaining the upper hand in Donbas through relentless artillery fire and airstrikes.
Hungary further angered some EU states when it said the question should not even be discussed at the summit on Monday. “It would only highlight our internal divisions without offering a realistic chance to resolve differences,” Orbán wrote last week to the European Council president, Charles Michel, who is organising the meeting.
Budapest is angling for EU funds to upgrade its refineries, which can currently only take Russian oil. Orbán complained that there were not enough specifics on EU funds for landlocked central European states in a recent European Commission plan outlining how the EU can move away from Russian fossil fuels.
In that plan, known as RePowerEU, the commission made a controversial proposal to allow member states to sell surplus carbon credits that could make it cheaper to burn fossil fuels. It also suggested a voluntary transfer of funds from other parts of the EU budget.
But some of the decarbonisation funds would be placed in a recovery plan, which is unavailable to Hungary because of longstanding concerns about the rule of law in the country. The country has been denied €7.2bn in funds from the EU’s Covid recovery fund because it has failed to satisfy EU officials that it can ensure the money is spent properly.
Hungary is seen as being in a vulnerable position as the Druzhba – which translates as “friendship” – pipeline runs through Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official described the part of the pipeline running to Hungary as “great leverage” last week. Olena Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said it would be “very appropriate if something happened to this pipeline”, according to comments reported by the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.
Hungary’s opposition means other measures in the EU sanctions package have not come into force, including tightening restrictions on Russian banks and imposing asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of high-ranking Russians, including a former gymnast rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."

Officials in eastern Ukraine say Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has been so intense that it has not been possible to assess casualties and damage, as Moscow closes in on the largest city still held by Ukraine in the Donbas.
“The situation has extremely escalated,” Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining defenders.
Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol, the southern port city that fell on 20 May after almost three months of relentless assault.
The intensified fighting came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited Ukrainian troops on the front lines in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, in his first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war.
“You risk your lives for us all and for our country,” Zelenskiy told soldiers there.
He added that Russian shelling has destroyed “the entire critical infrastructure of the city” and more than two-thirds of its housing stock. Taking Sievierodonetsk was Russia’s “principal aim” right now, the president said.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 145km (90 miles) south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
“They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region.
Having failed to take the capital Kyiv in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on the Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and air strikes.
Regional officials reported that Russian forces were “storming” Sievierodonetsk and that fighting was taking place street by street, knocking out power and mobile phone services.
Sievierodonetsk’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said those residents remaining in the city, which had a prewar population of about 100,000, risked exposure to shelling when they left their homes to access water. Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians have already died either from Russian attacks or from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn’t be treated.
Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Haidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child.
The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own.
“The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1 in an interview on Sunday.
Zelenskiy’s office posted a video on Telegram of him wearing a bulletproof vest and being shown destroyed buildings in Kharkiv and its surroundings, from where Russian forces have retreated in recent weeks.
It was the Ukrainian president’s first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers … One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation,” he said.
Last Thursday, Russian artillery pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Moscow’s troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. At least nine people have been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city.
Zelenskiy voiced hopes that his allies would provide much needed weapons and said he expected “good news” in the coming days.
A few days ago, the US and its allies indicated that they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing. Ukraine said it has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and US self-propelled howitzers.
Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak repeated a call for US-made long-range multiple-rocket launchers. US officials said such systems are actively being considered, with a decision possible in the coming days.
“It is hard to fight when you are attacked from 70km away and have nothing to fight back with,” Podolyak posted on Twitter. ”We need effective weapons.”
In the meantime, Zelenskiy said in a television interview that he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it has lost since the invasion.
Zelenskiy ruled out the idea of using force to win back all the land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014, which includes the southern peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow that year.
“I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/putin-vladimir-kara-murza-wife-russian-politician;2022-05-29;Ukraine war is Putin’s death warrant, says wife of jailed politician;"Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia says Russian president will fall over war in Ukraine
Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia thinks he will have been like a “hurricane contained inside a bottle” since he was arrested on 11 April in Moscow and held in pre-trial detention over a speech he had made in Arizona criticising the war in Ukraine.
“He has so much energy, so many ideas, and initiatives, that being contained within the four walls of a prison will be the hardest part for him,” said Evgenia, who has not been allowed to speak to him.
As a Russian politician, campaigner and regime critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza worked for 15 years alongside Boris Nemtsov, another opposition leader, who was killed in 2015.
Sitting in a hotel near Westminster on the same day she met the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, Evgenia Kara-Murza warned the UK government that her husband, a British citizen who has twice been allegedly poisoned by the Russian spy agency the FSB, may have reason to fear for his own life.
She had no criticism of her husband’s decision to repeatedly return to Russia, even after the invasion of Ukraine, saying: “He believed that as a Russian politician, he cannot call on people to continue fighting if he himself is somewhere safe, and he believes that he has to share the same risks, the same challenges as the Russians who continue to oppose this war.
“Basically, by calling this war a war, instead of the ‘special operation’ as the government wants it to be called, by saying that, a person can end up in prison for up to 15 years. On the basis of the charges laid so far Vladimir is now facing up to 10 years.”
No court date has been yet set, possibly because officials will press additional charges such as advocating personal sanctions against the regime, she said.
“Our family has been living like this for a long time,” said Kara-Murza, who has three teenage children. “He was targeted by an FSB team that tried to kill him twice in 2015 and 2017.
“Thanks to an amazing independent investigation by Bellingcat and Insider, we now know the names and the faces of those people from the FSB, who had followed him before the poisoning. Both times Vladimir was left in a coma with multiple organ failure. And I brought him back to the US. He recovered and then he went back to Russia.
“The Russian authorities have chosen this new tactic of dealing with opposition figures, especially well-known opposition figures like [Alexei] Navalny, or my husband – they try to lock them away and hide them from the public eye and prevent them from continuing to work. It is because they’re so effective when they’re outside.”
Kara-Murza said that since the war started Russia had switched from being an authoritarian regime to a totalitarian one. “There is not one independent media outlet left, there is massive repression and propaganda pumped out on national TV … There is a new iron curtain around this country.”
But she insisted dissent exists below the surface as people access news via virtual private networks or the Telegram messaging service. “I believe that Putin has not yet declared mobilisation because he knows how people will react to it. But a week or two ago, they said that there have already been 11 conscription centres burned down across Russia.
“So that’s how people protest – by saying: ‘We’re not going to go to your war.’ People get arrested for going out on the street with a copy of War and Peace. Others have been arrested for carrying ‘invisible anti-government slogans’. The police said they could see invisible things. It is that crazy.”
She pleaded for the west not to give up on the dissidents in Russia.
“I believe Putin has signed his own death warrant with this war,” she said, “but he will fall the sooner we end these double standards: at the same time as countries support the Ukrainian people by sending weapons and providing humanitarian aid and imposing sanctions on the Russian economy, they also give Putin billions for oil and gas, which allows him to continue his aggression … this has to stop because honestly, it is inexplicable.”
Her husband’s arrest and her campaign to secure his release have required her to change her role. “The fact is, I’ve never been a public figure. I’ve never been a public speaker, so everything I’m doing today, I’m learning it day by day.
“All the people I’m meeting, I heard of them, of course, from my husband’s work, but I’ve met very few of them before. So everything is novel. Everything – speaking and being on stage, speaking to journalists – is very new to me. It’s a rather glum joke, but we do have this joke in the family, that I only emerge when my husband gets poisoned or thrown in jail.”"

It was the photo of a young girl, dying in a Mariupol hospital after Russian shelling, that made up Martin Wyness’ mind. He had to go and help in Ukraine.
Less than three months later, he was in an ambulance racing to save the life of another little girl gravely injured by a Russian attack, as more shells crashed down around them. They turned around and raced back the way they had came, looking for another route to safety and medical care for the eight-year-old, whose body was peppered with shrapnel.
“They didn’t get her the first time so they had another go,” he said, in his hospital base in Donbas region. “As if that little girl wasn’t vulnerable enough.”
Wyness is part of a volunteer medical unit bridging the gap between Ukraine’s eastern frontline – which is experiencing the most intense fighting of the war – and major hospitals where war-injured soldiers and civilians can get long-term treatment for their wounds.
Medbat Pirogov volunteer hospital brings together dozens of Ukrainians, including some who returned from abroad to serve, and a handful of internationals who felt compelled to try to help out in a conflict thousands of miles from home.
“I felt this wasn’t Ukraine’s war, it was Europe’s war, my war,” said Wyness. He has twice made the journey to Ukraine from his Southampton home. The first month of the war he spent in the basement of a Kyiv hospital, patching up those injured in the battle for the city.
After the Russians were defeated he returned home for a break, but in early May returned to the new frontline near the almost-besieged town of Sievierodonetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the battle in Donbas was so intense that up to 100 of the country’s soldiers were dying in combat each day.
It is a gruelling artillery duel in which the enemy is often faceless and unseen, appearing only in the form of shells, rockets and missiles, and visible through the terrible injuries they inflict on the bodies of civilians and soldiers alike.
“Some days I think I’ve got to go, it’s just too much,” Wyness said, in an interview interrupted when shells started landing close to the base and the team had to race down to a basement bunker.
Both the injuries and the constant threat of death are exhausting; the medics are targets for a military that has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Ukraine and in Syria, killing doctors, nurses and patients in defiance of international law.
The medics are fundraising for armoured ambulances that would at least protect medics and patients from the worst of the shrapnel, but the war has sent prices even for secondhand vehicles soaring. So for now the group race towards the frontline in ordinary vehicles that would be ripped to shreds if an artillery round landed too close.
Jennifer spent $4,500 (£3,560) of her own money to travel from California and risk death daily to help out. She does not want her last name published because she told her mum she was only going to Poland to help refugees, although she told her daughters – who are 17 and 23 – the truth.
“The way I’ve raised them, they understand that this is an important thing to do,” she said. “If you know something is wrong and you don’t say or do anything, it’s doubly wrong.”
Jennifer worked as a medic in Afghanistan, on contract with the international mission, so is used to conflict injuries and dangerous environments but the intensity and proximity of the fighting in Ukraine has still shocked her.
“It’s more than I expected. Yesterday morning I was upstairs getting changed, a rocket flew by and landed just close by. The first night we got here we were in the basement, told to get ready to evacuate, because they thought the Russians had breached [Ukrainian lines] and were coming.”
She made up her mind to volunteer when she saw Zelenskiy appealing to the world for assistance in Ukraine’s struggle, and began researching her options before contacting Gennadiy Druzenko, the founder of Medbat. “It’s a struggle for freedom and they need help,” Jennifer said.
Ukrainians have tried to deter foreigners who do not have military experience from trying to go to the frontlines but Martin and Jennifer have practical skills that are needed as the deaths and injuries mount among civilians and soldiers.
There are also Ukrainian medics in the team, some returned from abroad, others unable to get commissions in the oversubscribed military medical corps but determined to serve. Dmytro Rusnak drove back from Germany with a car full of medical aid.
He had been getting ready for this moment for the best part of a decade. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea and Russian-backed proxy forces took control of parts of Donbas, Rusnak changed his speciality from radiology to acute care.
“I saw I had to prepare myself, because at any moment it was possible that Russia could start a full war,” he said. When they did, he paused only to put his contract on hold – his bosses were very understanding – and gather as much medical supplies as he could from friends and colleagues.
His main worry when the shells start falling is not his own safety but the worry he is bringing his elderly parents. “Although they are proud, it is very traumatic for them, there are no parents who want to see their children’s funeral.”
He is waiting to get his German medical qualifications certified so he can practise as a doctor in Ukraine, so for now works with Wyness as an ambulance paramedic.
“These years of education and preparation, all these skills, should be used,” he said. “I wanted to be an example, you can say thousands of words, make thousands of posts on social media, but this means nothing … you have to act, to do something.”"

It has been two months since 16-year-old Vlad Ksheminskyi sent off the forms he hoped would trigger the start of a new life in Britain.
Vlad is one of hundreds of teenagers who applied to the Homes for Ukraine scheme having fled war without his parents. While the Home Office struggles to decide how to deal with cases like his, they have been left in limbo for weeks – and even months – with no decision.
“It is very difficult to be waiting, knowing that my parents are one and a half thousand miles away and our destiny is still unknown,” Vlad said. “It’s very hard.”
A keen student, Vlad was preparing for school exams when areas around his home town of Krasyliv in western Ukraine came under intense bombing. His mum, Marina, was scared for his life but, being unable to leave, she rang her best friend, Olesia Reviuk, to ask if she could help her son escape.
Reviuk, 43, recalled: “She was telling me that every day they could hear sirens and three or four times a day they would go down to the bomb shelter which was very cold, with no water. It was impossible to sleep there at night with the sirens going off.”
Reviuk did not hesitate. “I promised that I would take good care of Vlad,” she said. She arranged for him to join her and her two sons in Italy, to where she had fled in February. Then, with his parents’ blessing, she became his legal guardian.
The children spoke English and no Italian, so Reviuk applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme at the earliest opportunity.
They were matched with Paul Hanlon, a GP from Lancaster, his wife, Rebecca Shepherd, an anatomy lecturer, and their two young children. The British family quickly made ready two large spare bedrooms and a separate living room, assuming the group would soon be arriving.
Instead, two months have gone by while Reviuk and the children wait in a cramped rented room in a flat in Modena, Italy.
Reviuk said: “Living in one bedroom with two teenage boys and one small child who wakes up at night and is also sometimes sick is very difficult for us.”
Hanlon, 42, said: “It’s so frustrating to think that they could have been enjoying the space and support on offer here, but instead we’ve all been spending hundreds of hours battling with bureaucracy that seems to have been set up to deflect rather than to protect those fleeing this brutal conflict.”
Hanlon is in touch with about 40 other sponsors in similar situations, all despairing at the same impasse. “The government’s broad answer to most questions on the subject, ‘because of safeguarding’, is a cynical use of this term to avoid having to deal with the most vulnerable group affected by this war.”
Given that Vlad is travelling with a legal guardian, his case should be one of the straightforward ones. But it appears to have made no difference.
“I do not understand the logic of safeguarding me because in my country there is a war and there is no worse security situation for me than staying there,” Vlad said. “It just doesn’t make sense to me what safeguarding issues the government could have, when we have all the documents in place and Olesia is a family friend who has legal guardianship?”
The Home Office has been sent a “letter before claim” over the families’ case, threatening judicial review. Vlad’s lawyer, Simon Robinson, said: “The delay in even providing a decision while keeping the family in the dark demonstrates that the secretary of state has failed to make an adequate policy to meet the promises she has made. She is turning her back on some of the most vulnerable people fleeing the conflict, children.”
For Vlad, the waiting means uncertainty over his education. He has only a week left to tell the Ukrainian authorities which country he will be in to take his exams remotely and is unsure what to put. He also wants to apply to university.
Reviuk said: “The UK government is taking the future away from Vlad. He’s a very talented boy. He reads a lot, he wants to study. And right now we just do not see the future.”"

More than 500 Ukrainian children who fled the war without their parents are stuck waiting in limbo across Europe after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, sources working closely with the Home Office say.
Most are teenagers who thought they would be eligible and have British families waiting to host them, but have heard nothing from the Home Office.
Many have been waiting for two months or more without an answer due to indecision about how to handle their cases.
Some are alone in Europe having left home thinking they would soon be joining a British family that is ready to welcome them. Others are with adult siblings or family friends who have been made legal guardians but still have no permission to come.
About 25 unaccompanied children were allowed into Britain during the first two weeks of the Homes For Ukraine scheme and ended up in care as a result, sources say.
Though the policy now says children cannot travel without their parents unless they are with a legal guardian, the Home Office has not been offering a decision or solution to all those who applied before this was set out.
Even teenagers travelling with adults who have been made legal guardians by their parents are among those caught up in the deadlock.
Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said: “I have only this week raised concerns in a letter to the immigration minister regarding the government’s policy on unaccompanied minors, but this latest information reflects the potential scale of the problem.
“We understand that the government needs to undertake comprehensive safeguarding checks but there is a particular question about why long delays are still happening in instances where a parent has already completed the relevant paperwork which grants permission for their child to be placed in the care of a relative.”
Earlier this month, the Guardian told the story of Nazarii, 17, who was listening to war planes flying overhead in his village in western Ukraine while he waited for a decision from the Home Office. A teaching assistant and her family in Hampshire were ready to host him but he had heard nothing since submitting an application on 11 April.
More than three weeks later, he is still in Ukraine with no refusal or update. “The Home Office hasn’t given me any information. I don’t know what to do,” he said. “If it’s a refusal, OK, but without any information it’s impossible.”
Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the child refugee charity Safe Passage, said: “We know of far too many children who are currently stuck in limbo, alone in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, who are desperate to join their sponsors here in the UK. Unacceptably, this is leaving lone children in dangerous and vulnerable positions, at risk of exploitation.”
Gardiner-Smith said the government should expand the Homes for Ukraine scheme to include unaccompanied children by working with local authorities and charities to ensure safeguarding.
Even those with British hosts ready to foster children have had no decision. Among these is severely autistic 16-year-old Timothy Tymoshenko, who the Guardian reported is still waiting in Poland to be allowed to join a British foster carer.
The situation is so critical that sources said it was the biggest point of concern at the latest weekly meeting of MPs’ offices with the Home Office.
Krish Kandiah, the founder of the Sanctuary Foundation, which is supporting British hosts in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, said: “It is disturbing to hear that unaccompanied minors seeking to leave Ukraine for their own safety are waiting so long for visas when I know that there are foster carers like my own family and other appropriate hosts in the UK that are willing to care for them.”
A government spokesperson said: “Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK.
“The Ukrainian government has been clear that their preference is children should not be taken from Ukraine without their parents and that moving a child from their home region must be in their best interest.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/ukraine-donbas-donetsk-luhansk-fighting-putin-kharkiv-kyiv;2022-05-29;Fighting focuses on Donbas, but Putin has not given up on Kharkiv – or Kyiv;"The outcome of Russia’s attacks on the Donetsk and Luhansk areas will determine the fate of the rest of Ukraine
After three months of full-scale war against Ukraine, in which ground troops invaded from several directions and missiles hit targets across the country, right up to the western border with Poland, the focus of the current phase of the conflict is back on the region where Russia has been fighting Ukraine for the past eight years: Donbas.
Military analyst Michael Kofman wrote on Twitter last week: “The overall military balance in this war still trends in Ukraine’s favour, given manpower availability and access to extensive Western military support … But the local balance in the Donbas during this phase is a different story.”
How fully and how quickly Vladimir Putin attains his objectives in Donbas may dictate how and whether other parts of Ukraine come back into play. The level of losses sustained will also play a role.
Russia has abandoned attempts to encircle all Ukrainian forces in Donbas for the more modest goal of creating “cauldrons” – smaller encirclements cutting Ukrainians off from supplies and reinforcements.
Last week, the focus was on the city of Sievierodonetsk, where local governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia had committed 10,000 soldiers and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment to attacking the city. There are reports that the Russians already control a hotel on the outskirts of the city, after many days of ruthless bombardments.
If Russia takes Sievierodonetsk, it will control the entire Luhansk region, and can increase its focus on parts of Donetsk it still does not control.
“I don’t think the Russian offensive looks stalled, and while sluggish, there is no good way to predict when it will culminate,” wrote Kofman.
There is no longer any doubt that Russia plans to fully annex parts of Ukraine, as it did with Crimea in 2014. Then, Moscow declined to do the same with the areas it controlled in east Ukraine, preferring instead to prop up separatist administrations there. Now, there is talk of rapid annexation of the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces that Russia took in the first days of the invasion.
Unlike Mariupol, which Russia conquered after bombing it to rubble – and possibly other cities in Donbas that Russia may soon capture – these territories were largely taken with no fighting, so Russia has been able to focus on mopping up dissent and trying to take full control.
The areas have seen an increased crackdown on pro-Ukrainian sentiment, as well as reports that Russia is introducing the rouble and Moscow time zone, announcements that teachers will be retrained in the Russian curriculum, and a series of sinister videos of locals announcing on camera that they had been through “a course of denazification” and no longer support Ukraine.
Formal annexation of this territory could have huge consequences for the prospect of a peace deal. Ukraine will not accept the loss of these areas, but if it launches a counterattack, Russia could claim Ukraine was attacking Russian territory.
Life in the Ukrainian capital feels more normal by the week. The occasional air raid siren and men with guns on the streets are reminders of the war, but cafe terraces are busy, the opera has reopened and the curfew has been pushed back to 11pm. Since the Russians withdrew at the beginning of April, there has been no artillery threat, and no repeat of the booms from the suburbs that characterised the first weeks of the war.
However, Russian-language news outlet Meduza last week quoted Kremlin-linked sources claiming that Putin had not yet given up on Kyiv and may launch another assault once the battle for Donbas is over.
As with Kyiv, the Russians attempted to storm the country’s second city in the early days of the war and, as in the capital, they faced unexpectedly strong resistance, were stalled on the outskirts and then pushed back into positions surrounding the city.
In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russians back further but, unlike with Kyiv, the invaders are still within striking distance of the city. Last Thursday, areas within the city limits were shelled for the first time in two weeks and nine civilians died, according to local authorities.
Military commanders say there is no sign of a new advance on Kharkiv, but the Russians are digging firmly into the positions they still hold, with no plans to retreat all the way to the border as they did elsewhere.
“They are planning something,” said one commander based outside the city last week.
“We may only find out what it is when it happens.”"

Russia needs to stop being a threat: to its neighbours, to its own people, to the world. Minimising that threat should be the goal of our policies and the only way to face up to the reality of the Kremlin’s boot stamping on so many faces. The hope that the current iteration of Russia is ready to recognise that other states have rights is gone. Putin’s Russia is not an ordinary country seeking some rational security guarantees. It’s a predator that works according to its own logic of internal oppression and external aggression. With such a state there is no going back to “normal”. No clever “deal” that can be cut to restore previous relations.
As we work out what minimising Russia’s threat means in practice, we may also get to something bigger: a set of security, humanitarian and economic interconnections that redefine how we reduce aggression in an interconnected age. Russia’s aim in its invasion of Ukraine was to reset the world order, tilt it towards dictatorships, impunity and the right of great powers to crush the small. Instead, it may produce a desire to strengthen rights, sovereignty and democracy. In pushing for the worst, it might produce something better.
The first place where Russia’s threat has to be minimised is in Ukraine itself. This will be achieved on the battlefield. Ukraine is still vastly outnumbered in both men and arms. The situation in the Donbas is tenuous. Every day, about 100 Ukrainian soldiers are killed. And it’s no longer hardened professional fighters – it’s IT specialists, sociologists, students.
When I met President Zelenskiy, together with colleagues from the Atlantic magazine a few weeks ago, his greatest fear was that the victory in the battle for Kyiv meant that too many people would think the war over when it was just shifting to a different, more deadly phase in the Donbas. The world’s attention has faded. Allies are being slow to arm Ukraine sufficiently. Positions are being ceded daily because of a lack of basic munitions for artillery. This needs to change fast. Any eventual negotiations have to be taken from a position of Ukrainian strength, not weakness, or else they risk being another deal that gives up all the leverage to Russia, only augmenting the threat it poses.
We shouldn’t be worried about “humiliating” Putin and his henchmen on the battlefield – humiliation in Russian politics and society comes from within, centuries of not dealing with a history of repression and mass murder has produced a political culture that seethes with resentment and fear. All that can be done is encourage Russian elites and society to face up to the reality and the limits of their power. It’s up to us whether negotiations – if and when they happen – take place in the far east with Russia exhausted – or at the gates of Kyiv, with Russia ascendant.
If and when those negotiations happen, Ukraine has to be armed to the teeth to deter future Russian incursions. It is also hoping for security guarantees, including from the UK. But there’s a greater context here too. The Russian invasion is relevant to any nation that lives unprotected in the neighbourhood of nuclear bullies: think Moldova, Georgia and the central Asian states around Russia; Japan, Australia and Taiwan around China. It’s no coincidence that Australia, a country that could have chosen to sit out this conflict, has been such an enthusiastic advocate of the Ukrainian cause, even providing $70m-worth of defensive equipment.
How can you protect such countries from aggression, given they are not Nato members and the nuclear status of the states that threaten them? The ad hoc support to Ukraine gives us a clue: a mix of economic warfare and provision of arms. But to act as a deterrent this threat has to be made clear and be coordinated before any invasion. Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022 because, after its 2014 invasion, Putin thought he could get away with it. The moment sanctions kick in should not be up for debate: a war of aggression should trigger harsh measures.
Moreover, we need to tie crimes against humanity to even more aggressive sanctions. The indiscriminate bombing of Mariupol or slaughter in Bucha should lead to oil embargoes. We need to reconnect humanitarian norms to economics.
So far, the economic power dynamics lie the other way. At the moment, a country such as Australia, which criticised Beijing’s human rights record, is bullied by China with grain sanctions. Russia holds the world hostage to hunger by limiting its own grain exports and blocking Ukraine’s, demanding sanctions against Russia are lifted. In central Europe, a gruesome calculation is emerging: what hike in gas prices are people willing to bear before they close their eyes to Putin’s crimes against humanity? Everywhere, human rights are subservient to economic needs. For us to rein in the aggression of the Russias and Chinas of this world, it needs to be the other way round.
While such measures can act as a deterrent, Russia will also have to change internally before it stops being a threat. Can we ever hope for a Russia that is ready to give up imperial pretensions, live in harmony with its neighbours and even establish rule of law at home? It seems a far-off dream. All talk about “regime change” from outside is foolish: Russia is a great power no one can influence or attack that brazenly. But what we can do is remain steadfast in our sanctions and commitment to indicting war criminals, showing Russian elites that their punishment is long and serious. Anecdotal research from inside the country suggests many think the sanctions will be lifted soon. This betrays great weakness. In his memoirs of life in Nazi concentration camps, the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl noted that those who thought their imprisonment would end soon were in denial of reality – and the first to then break and collapse.
Who will communicate this? Currently, we are not explaining the meaning and intent of sanctions and western policy to the Russian people. If they are perceived purely as random and poorly motivated economic weapons, this will actually risk strengthening the cleaving of Russian society to the state. People bunch together when faced with what they claim, rightly or wrongly, is an unjustified attack. However, if they are shown to be part of a more values-based rejection of Russia from the global community, somewhat like South Africa under apartheid, then they will act as a way to undermine Russians’ connection to their own leadership. It’s no wonder that Kremlin propaganda is always celebrating any cracks in western resolve towards Russia: from Tucker Carlson’s pro-Russian diatribes through to Italian and French “peace” proposals favourable to Moscow. The Kremlin knows many Russians don’t want to feel completely isolated and rejected from the world.
We have launched a form of economic warfare, without backing it up with advocacy and engagement. This is absurd, allowing the Kremlin to manage perceptions. It wouldn’t be hard to get Russians’ attention. A short video from Arnold Schwarzenegger directed at his Russian fans and condemning the war got millions of views. The Russian internet firewall is feeble: you can still use radio, WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube. The more understanding there is that the Kremlin has led people into a dead end, that this is permanent, the more impetus there is for elites to change the direction of the country.

Now the two female journalists are safe in England but want to continue their work
After 48 days under Russian occupation, they were so used to seeing enemy soldiers on every street corner that they thought the first Ukrainian checkpoint out of Kherson could be a trap. Arriving in a long column of cars, filled mostly with women, babies and pets, Oksana Borisova and Alisa Poliakova (who are speaking under pseudonyms to protect their families still living in occupied territory), didn’t dare trust that they were safe.
For weeks, Russian soldiers had stalked them around the southern Ukrainian city in Z-marked vehicles, destroyed their livelihoods, imprisoned and tortured their friends and lobbed grenades at them at rallies. But after driving past seven Russian checkpoints over 10 hours to Mykolaiv – a journey that prewar would have taken an hour – and surviving a close encounter with a missile, they had finally reached what appeared to be a Ukrainian soldier.
“You understand that it should be our territory, and you see the soldier, but can’t distinguish the military signs on his uniform,” said Borisova, now in the UK, recalling their escape last month. “And you think: ‘Well, Russian or Ukrainian?’”
The confirmation she was looking for came when, the car window lowered to the greeting “dobrogo dnia!” (Ukrainian for “Good day”). She could have hugged him, she said. “Because now I believed that the Ukrainian army exists. Since 24 February we hadn’t seen our soldiers.”
In a series of dispatches for the Observer at the start of the war, the two female Ukrainian journalists bravely documented the horrors of life in occupied Kherson – from the city’s brave resistance to looming humanitarian disaster and burying the dead. But they also offered an insight into how, despite it all, residents fiercely continued to find glimmers of joy: a tale of young hospital interns getting married; drinking coffee at their favourite coffee shop under the roar of artillery strikes. There were scenes of dark humour too. In one dispatch, they described how a queue of civilians laughed a group of empty-handed Russian soldiers out of the butcher’s shop because they were unimpressed with the quality of meat available.
Despite growing numbers of people leaving, the escalating danger – particularly for journalists – and dwindling supplies, the old friends, who are both in their 50s, hadn’t planned to leave their home city.
Despite writing anonymously, they feared being identified by their reporting. One of their friends, Oleh Baturin, was detained and tortured for eight days and threatened with mutilation and death, and Maxim Negrov, the owner of the online newspaper Postfactum, was arrested and detained. They also worried that if the city were liberated it could lead to further killings by Russian soldiers.
But it was only when they were offered seats in friends’ cars that they made the decision to go. Borisova in a car with her daughter-in-law and a baby, and Poliakova with a friend and her cat. Their husbands and sons remain in Kherson.
“I made up my mind very quickly, during half a day,” said Borisova. “Not because of me, more for the sake of my daughter-in-law because my son begged me. Now with all these Bucha stories [of rape], he was very afraid. He said: ‘I will sleep well when you girls get out of Kherson.’” She added: “That chance was given to me and it was too foolish not to take it.”
They left just in time. Just a few days ago, an acquaintance was shot in the head and killed trying to escape. His family were not allowed to bury him. “Now I’m ready to pay any money for my son to leave,” said Borisova. “And I told him frankly: ‘Don’t bargain, pay anything they want, I will get money for you.’” Her mother, who her husband has promised to take care of while she is away, is dying with cancer.
After reaching Mykolaiv, they went to Odesa, which, initially at least, felt like “a resort”. At a cafe, they drank good coffee and ate fish, revelling in the fact that they didn’t have to worry about being harassed by Russian soldiers. But when bombing started, they realised it wasn’t safe there either.
With the help of Christian volunteers, they travelled for free by bus to Germany via Moldova, where they stayed at a shelter for two nights, before reaching Halle where they had been invited to Artist and the City, a residency on the role of public spaces. Last week, they arrived at Stansted under the Homes for Ukraine scheme after a London-based friend found them a host.
After months of communicating online, this is our first time meeting in person. Sat side by side on a sofa in the quiet Surrey suburbs, Poliakova wearing a blue T-shirt and Borisova a hoodie that says “I speak fluent sarcasm” across it, they seem remarkably calm and pragmatic on the surface – direct and quick to laugh and joke – but as they talk the heaviness of their deep pain seeps through.
Although arriving in the UK was in some ways a relief, they continue to suffer from the steady stream of debilitating updates from home via Telegram. “This news makes us anxious, depressed, we cry,” said Borisova. “We cry every day.”
Before the war, their lives in Kherson were busy and full. Borisova travelled throughout Europe, writing about architecture and contemporary art, and Poliakova reported on political and social issues. In the summer, they spent holidays and weekends at the nearby seaside. Now, however, the shore has been mined by Russia.
While it was not very prosperous and had fallen victim to corruption, Kherson was “a cosy city and very warm”, they said, and had potential as a tourist attraction. They had a new mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, who they hoped would restore the city with new green zones and public spaces. But after the invasion of Ukraine and a battle for the city, on 2 March Kherson became the first to fall. Kolykhaiev has since been replaced by a pro-Russian administration.
After the Russians arrived, they said, the city was “cut off from the rest of the country immediately”. The television centre was quickly seized and the vast majority of residents did not have time to leave. “The next day we were absolutely sieged.”
Living under occupation, the issue of trust has become a life or death matter. “We stopped talking to anyone, it’s a paranoia,” said Borisova. “You stop believing people.” To illustrate, Poliakova cites the example of a former city manager who was such a convincing patriot with his “perfect Ukrainian”, slogans and speeches but turned out to be a Russian collaborator.
Although for weeks they continued to attend daily protests in the city’s Freedom Square, a sense of escalating threat and distrust was palpable in their occupation diaries and in my communications with them. In one of their final Signal messages before they left, Borisova expressed doubt they would stay alive.
How did their feelings change under occupation? “From great, great fear to some acceptance of reality to total despair, because nothing helps you to accept it really,” said Borisova. She compares waking up under occupation to the film Groundhog Day. “It’s a nightmare and you feel like the day is repeating and repeating.”
The streets were littered with explosives disguised as toys and they were watchful entering their homes. Each day, from around 3pm, the streets would empty out when soldiers started patrolling. People hid in their houses to avoid being shot. “Riding their vehicles around with their machine guns they could be drunk sometimes and just start firing. So it was quite dangerous wandering around in the evening,” said Borisova.
While it was rare to see the Russians engaging in terrible acts in the morning, they could be hungry and angry. “They were told in Russia that we would be happy to have them there. And they couldn’t understand, it was a paradoxical thing for them, that we were not waving flowers and Russian flags.”
For weeks, the Russian response to the daily protests was muted, giving them the confidence to carry on. “It was a very surprising thing for me personally, and for others I suppose, that why they allowed protests so long,” said Borisova, who now sees it as a tactic to paint them as “aggressive Nazis” rising up against “peaceful Russian soldiers”. But on 21 March, the protesters were taken by complete surprise when they were met with grenades. The next day, there was teargas and shooting and Borisova narrowly escaped with her life. Rally numbers dwindled and soon the protests stopped.
“For the first time we saw lots of blood on the ground and we understood it was the end of peaceful rallies,” she said with sombre finality. “They showed us, ‘OK people, we’re fed up with it.’”
Now, they said, life in Kherson is very tough. There are no jobs, Russia has stolen their grain and people are being paid in food instead of money. Meanwhile, the shops are full of expensive food from Moldova and regions of Russia that most couldn’t afford to buy, even if they wanted to.
“For people who stayed there, nothing will help them except themselves,” said Poliakova. “So they start making gardens, orchards near their houses to provide themselves with some food.”
Sometimes medicines are smuggled in, but it’s painfully insufficient.
“So many countries of the world are ready to help us but it’s not very easy to squeeze between all these checkpoints,” said Borisova. “They’re numerous. And sometimes they’re in good mood, sometimes they’re furious, so it’s quite a roulette.”
Trying to escape now can mean spending several days in battlefields surrounded by explosions. “We were lucky to escape within one day,” said Borisova. “But after the roadblocks are getting more and more numerous, people spend two-three days. You’re very, very scared. You are in the centre of the battle.” A ghost city would be bad for Russian propaganda, she said, but not everyone wants to leave. There are those who are prepared to cooperate and are informing on their neighbours.
Although many of its residents speak Russian, the journalists said there has been a sharp rejection of Russia since 2014, when Moscow annexed nearby Crimea, but Russian culture was not cancelled entirely. But now, as she translates the eyewitness accounts of Ukrainian women and girls who have been killed and raped by Russian soldiers for a book about the war, Borisova said she cannot tolerate anything Russian.
“When you come through this terror and see these atrocities … I couldn’t bear it,” she said. “While translating, I was just crying. I stopped for a while to comfort myself but it’s unbearable to read all of this.”
Since arriving in the UK they have been received with warmth and kindness, immediately bonding with their host over their shared love of Monty Python, but it has also been overwhelming. Borisova is trying to see it as an adventure, but Poliakova feels a strong pull back to Ukraine. They want to continue their journalistic work, documenting Ukrainians’ experiences of the invasion and hope to write a book.
“We are very conscious that our psychological conditions are very fragile. Not stable,” said Borisova. But she hopes that every day spent in the UK will help distract them from their grief. “This routine, this desire to see another places, meeting with other people will help us to cope and to overcome.”"

Ukraine is urgently pleading for heavy weapons to repel Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region, as relentless Russian artillery and airstrikes threaten to turn the tide of the war and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping. Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems, which are capable of striking targets up to 300km away, to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that not all the land that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014 can be recaptured militarily. While he is certain his country will take back the territory Russia has claimed since its 24 February invasion, he said other territory could not be recovered by force. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said.
Russia’s defence ministry claims to have captured the strategically important city of Lyman and several other smaller towns and encircled Sievierodonetsk, which Ukraine denies. Zelenskiy said in a Saturday night television address that conditions in Donbas were “indescribably difficult”, and thanked Ukrainian defenders holding out in the face of the onslaught.
At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned Russian oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems, vanishing from the global maps used to locate marine traffic. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich.
Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has scrapped the upper age limit for military recruits in the face of mounting losses in Ukraine, Tass reported. UK intelligence estimated this month Russia had lost about a third of its ground forces.
Officials in the south-eastern port city of Mykolaiv said at least one person was killed, and at least six injured, in Russian shelling. Two rounds landed in courtyards of high-rise buildings, and one shell fell close to a kindergarten, CNN reported.
Boris Johnson and Zelenskiy discussed concerns over food supplies in a phone call. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Zelenskiy the UK would continue to support Ukraine’s armed resistance, including by supplying equipment. She added that the UK was involved in “intensive work … with international partners to find ways to resume the export of grain from Ukraine to avert a global food crisis”.
Putin spoke to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz and, according to the Kremlin, he told them that continuing arms supplies was “dangerous”, warning “of the risks of further destabilisation of the situation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis”. Russia said it was willing to discuss ways to make it possible for Ukraine to resume shipments of grain from Black Sea ports.
Spain is sending a battery of surface-to-air missiles and about 100 troops to the Nato forward presence mission in Latvia, joining about 500 compatriots already present in the Baltic state, El País reported."

Ukraine is in a race against time to save the eastern Donbas region as relentless Russian artillery and air strikes threaten to turn the tide of the war, and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping.
Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk. The rockets would be capable of striking Russian firing positions, military bases, air strips and supply lines at a range of up to 300km (185 miles).
“We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to engage the enemy over a long distance,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said. “The price of delay is measured by the lives of people who have protected the world from [Russian] fascism.”
Ongoing disagreements in Washington have held up MLRS deliveries. Some of President Joe Biden’s national security advisers are said to be fearful Ukraine may use the rockets to hit targets inside Russia, a development that could spark an escalation drawing in the US and Nato. Kyiv has previously launched attacks on Russian soil.
Moscow, keenly aware of the game-changing potential of the rocket systems, has already voiced strong objections. “If the Americans do this, they will clearly cross a red line,” said Olga Skabeeva, an influential Russian state TV host whose views reflect the Kremlin’s. Russia’s response could be “very harsh”, she warned.
US news outlets reported on Saturday that Biden had agreed to provide some rocket systems as part of a major new US arms package for Ukraine to be announced this week. The package may also include another advanced weapon, the high mobility artillery rocket system, known as Himars.
The decision reportedly followed talks between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “Heavy weapons on top of our agenda, and more are coming our way,” Kuleba said after the talks.
But doubts remain about which weapons systems will be provided, and the timing of the US move. The White House and the Pentagon have yet to confirm the reports.
“I won’t get ahead of decisions that haven’t been made yet,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said. Despite the delay, he insisted it was “not too late” to send new weapons to Ukraine.
If the US defies Russia’s warnings and goes ahead this week, the UK is expected to simultaneously announce it will also supply advanced long-range rocket systems. The British version of the MLRS, which can fire 12 missiles in less than a minute, has a more limited range of 84kms (52 miles). Earlier this month, Britain announced an additional £1.3bn in military support.
Speaking in Prague on Friday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was “completely legitimate” for Nato and EU countries to provide more weapons, including tanks and planes, to Ukraine despite Russia’s objections. Like Boris Johnson, Truss says Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, must be seen to lose the war. Britain has demanded a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders.
The UK’s uncompromising stance is not shared by leading European countries shaken by Russia’s advances, whose focus is increasingly on notional peace negotiations. Henry Kissinger, the veteran American diplomat, fuelled this debate last week in Davos by suggesting Kyiv should prepare to make concessions, amounting to a possible de facto partition.
Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held an 80-minute phone conversation with Putin, during which they urged the Russian president to hold “direct serious negotiations” with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The French president and German chancellor called for an “immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”.
Keir Giles, of London-based thinktank Chatham House, said a quick end to the conflict appeared to be the priority for France and Germany.
“There are already worrying indications that the flakiest of the western European partners may be discussing between themselves how to force a surrender on Ukraine in the form of territorial concessions in order to end the fighting ... It is more important to them [France and Germany] to end the fighting than to arrive at a workable outcome,” Giles said.
This apparent shift has angered east European governments such as Poland, whose president accused Germany of failing to keep a promise to provide heavy weapons. After Italy last week put forward a peace plan, which was dismissed by the Kremlin as “fantasy”, Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvia’s foreign minister, warned that, in any case, Putin could not be trusted to stick to any settlement.
“Any agreement with Russia isn’t worth a broken penny,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser and peace talks negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. “Is it possible to negotiate with a country that always lies cynically? ... Russia has proved that it is a barbarian country that threatens world security. A barbarian can only be stopped by force.”
Pressure to talk peace or make concessions is feeding Ukraine’s concerns that it is in a race against time to turn around its battlefield fortunes. The Kyiv government said on Saturday that its forces may have to retreat from Luhansk to avoid encirclement.
Russia’s defence ministry said the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman had fallen under the full control of Russian and Russian-backed forces in the region. Meanwhile, a group of independent international legal experts accused Russia of committing genocide.
Notwithstanding recent Ukrainian setbacks, Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, said the west must not back away now.
“Having supported Ukraine and encouraged them to stand up to Russian aggression in the early phase, we’ve now got a real obligation to see it through for the long term,” he said. “It would be disastrous to scale down western support after they’ve done the really hard bit to face the Russians. We’ve got to knuckle down for the long term. Military support can reduce over time and probably the economic support will become more important as the fighting gradually subsides.”"

A London host of a Ukrainian family has written to her local food bank “begging for help” because rising energy costs mean she can no longer afford to feed her new guests.
The Ukrainian family, now coming to a food bank in Euston, north London, every week, is among a growing number of recently arrived refugees from the war-torn country relying on handouts to survive, according to charities.
Helena Aksentijevic, manager of the Euston food bank, said she had been handed the letter by the Ukrainian family. It was from the host and said that they were struggling to cover the extra cost of feeding two women and two children, as well as additional energy costs.
Aksentijevic said the system was “a mess” and that the number of Ukrainian refugees coming to the food bank, which had had a 300% increase in visitors since the start of the pandemic, was rising rapidly.
Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refugees are eligible for a £200 interim payment for subsistence costs, provided by their local council, and can apply for benefits, including universal credit, pension credit, disability benefits, carer’s allowance and child benefit. However, some say their access to benefits has been delayed because they have not yet received biometric residence permits. The government denies this.
Sponsors can claim £350 a month from the government. They do not have to feed refugees, but many do.
Most of the Ukrainians coming to the food banks are women with children, but Aksentijevic said they had also been visited by a teenage boy. “I can only see us getting more and more people from that community,” she said.
The Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) and the Trussell Trust, which between them represent hundreds of food banks, report that newly arrived Ukrainians are seeking help to feed their families.
Ifan said it had created Ukrainian versions of its referral leaflets in the Highlands and Carlisle.
Sabine Goodwin, Ifan’s coordinator, said: “A social security system that is fit for purpose would be able to support Ukrainian refugees struggling to afford food.”
Meanwhile, amid an escalating cost of living crisis, food banks are already struggling to meet the needs of people across the UK. Research by the food network found earlier this month that 93% of its members reported an increase in the need for services since the start of the year, while more than 80% reported issues with food supplies.
Goodwin said that new cost of living crisis measures announced last week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were welcome, but added that “there’s a long way to go before people in the UK can count on accessible financial help at a time of crisis”.
A refugee living alone in emergency accommodation in Exeter said she had visited a food bank after losing her Homes for Ukraine sponsor. She said she was “very well received” and was given help to choose food.
Sutton4Ukrainians, a support group, said that one in three refugees they encounter go to food banks, many because they are waiting to access benefits or because the money they have does not stretch far enough.
A spokesperson said the £200 interim council payment for subsistence was insufficient. “This is not a huge amount – public transport is expensive,” they said, adding that often refugees wanted to be independent.
Lifeafterhummus Community Benefit Society in north London has worked with several Ukrainian refugees who have visited its outdoor surplus food cart. One family said they were being sponsored but that they did not have access to food. Lifeafterhummus has also supplied refugees with cooking equipment.
Farrah Rainfly, the group’s operations manager, said the issue for Ukrainian refugees came on top of the existing cost of living crisis. “I have families coming to me in tears, saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do.’”
A government spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these reports – Ukrainians can access benefits immediately without a biometric test and will receive an additional £200 payment while these are being processed.
“Translation services are available to help with phone applications for benefits, welcome points have been set up to help arrivals and we are in constant contact with councils who are providing further support to the small number of Ukrainians who may need more help.”"

In the sparkling azure waters of Antigua, the gleaming £95m superyacht Alfa Nero could be seen at anchor last week by sightseers enjoying the Caribbean coastline. But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find.
Since the invasion of Ukraine, the superyacht, which is linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev, has vanished off the global tracking maps used to locate marine traffic.
An investigation by the Observer this weekend reveals it is one of at least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs which have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich.
At least 13 such vessels with a total value of nearly £2bn have already been impounded since the invasion of Ukraine, from southern France to Fiji. In the latter case, the superyacht Amadea, allegedly linked to the gold billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, was seized on behalf of the US.
Analysts report an increase in Russian-linked yachts which are turning off the automatic identification system (AIS) equipment used for tracking large vessels. The system can be turned off for legitimate reasons, but experts believe some vessels want to avoid detection.
An analysis by the Observer of AIS data compiled by the maritime and aviation market intelligence firm VesselsValue reveals other superyachts which have “gone dark” for more than a month include:
The 72-metre (238ft) superyacht Clio, linked to industrialist Oleg Deripaska, which sailed from the Indian Ocean to Turkey after the invasion. Its last transmitted location was on 18 April in the Black Sea, within range of the Russian ports of Sochi and Novorossiysk.
The 70-metre Galactica Super Nova, linked to the oligarch Vagit Alekperov, the sanctioned former president of Lukoil. The last transmitted location of the vessel was on 2 March off the Croatian coast.
The 140-metre Ocean Victory, linked to the sanctioned oligarch Viktor Rashnikov, which last transmitted its location at anchor in the Maldives on 1 March.
One member of crew on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK told the Observer last week: “We were told to turn off the AIS. We removed the screws on the power plug and pulled it out.”
There are about 9,300 superyachts on the seas, worth more than £50bn, according to industry data. An estimated 10% of that fleet is owned by Russians.
One of the first superyachts to be impounded was the 86-metre Amore Vero, linked to the oil tycoon Igor Sechin, which was seized by customs officers at a shipyard at La Ciotat, near Marseille, on 2 March.
Italian authorities also impounded the 143-metre Sailing Yacht A on 12 March in Trieste. It is believed to be owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Andrey Melnichenko. He was sanctioned by the UK on 15 March.
Melnichenko’s other superyacht, the futuristic £240m Motor Yacht A, has disappeared from global tracking system. Its last confirmed location was on 10 March in the Maldives.
The last recorded location of the Alfa Nero on AIS was in the Caribbean on 3 March, when it was anchored at Philipsburg in Sint Maarten. The yacht is operating on a skeleton crew and has put its tender, the Alfa Fish, into storage.
Guryev, 62, a Russian who made his fortune with the Russian fertiliser giant PhosAgro, is reported by maritime sources to be the owner of the vessel. He was revealed to have bought London’s largest private residence, the 25-bedroom mansion Witanhurst, for £50m in 2008.
He has regularly enjoyed sailing on the Alfa Nero. The vessel is also used by his family, including his son (also Andrey) and his son’s wife, Valeria, who studied at the London College of Fashion and once reportedly stated on Instagram that she was “too pretty for work”. Like many yachts, it is owned via an opaque offshore structure, and Guryev has denied being the owner.
Other yachts which have not been tracked by AIS for more than a month include the Galactica Super Nova, which has a glass-bottomed swimming pool with a waterfall. It left Tivat in Montenegro on 2 March and promptly disappeared off the system.
The Clio, linked to Deripaska, sailed more than 3,000 miles after the invasion, from the Maldives, through the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean and into the Bosphorus, gateway to the Black Sea and its Russian ports. In the Clio’s case, one reason it may have gone dark could be the perilous situation in the Black Sea arising from the war.
Other yachts which have not transmitted a confirmed location via AIS for at least a month include the My Sky, linked to the cigarette tycoon Igor Kesaev, which last reported its location in the Maldives on 30 March. The Maldives has no extradition treaty with the US, and at least five yachts linked to Russian owners have headed for its waters since the invasion. Other vessels, including two owned by Roman Abramovich, have headed to Turkey.
Under maritime rules, AIS should always be in operation when ships are under way or at anchor. All vessels of 300 gross tonnage and upwards must be fitted with it. A cruising vessel will typically transmit its location frequently, but it can turn the system off when in port. The data is relayed by radio receivers and satellites.
Sam Tucker at VesselsValue said: “There are some vessels where we would be previously getting a signal every few minutes from transponders and we are now seeing gaps of months. It’s very likely that some have flicked off the switch and gone into stealth mode.”
None of the sanctioned oligarchs linked to the six superyachts suspected of turning off their AIS responded to a request for comment."

On the ninth day of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, editor-in-chief Viktor Muchnik gathered the staff of TV2 for a meeting at their small newsroom in the Siberian city of Tomsk.
New wartime laws meant the whole newsroom risked jailtime for reporting on the conflict, Muchnik told them, and TV2 had just been officially blocked by Russia’s communications watchdog, along with many other independent media outlets.
“All of us who wanted to change things for the better here, at this moment we can feel we have failed,” said Muchnik, reflecting bitterly on his three decades of work at one of Russia’s most resilient media outlets.
The journalists drained glasses of wine, and almost everybody cried. Then Muchnik signed resignation papers for the entire collective. A few days later, he and his wife, Viktoria, who also worked for TV2 for more than a quarter of a century, packed a couple of suitcases and flew out of Russia, probably for ever.
“One reason was professional: the thing you’ve been doing for so long has been killed. The other one was human. Neither of us wanted to be inside this space, in this country which has launched a war, and living among people who support this war,” said Muchnik, in an interview in the Armenian capital Yerevan, where the couple now live, along with tens of thousands of Russians who have fled in the weeks since the war began.
For years, TV2 was an anomaly in the Russian media landscape, an island of media freedom in the Siberian university town of Tomsk. From its chaotic yet idealistic beginnings as the Soviet Union collapsed, through various gritty battles with authorities, culminating in fury, defiance and ultimately defeat, the history of TV2 gives remarkable insight into Russia’s last three decades.
The channel was the brainchild of Arkady Maiofis, a reporter on Soviet television who wanted to create a place for free debate in 1991 as the Soviet Union was on its last legs. At the time, Muchnik was a young history professor attracted by the idea of making political programmes; the first cameraman was a former policeman
“Arkady was the only one who knew anything about television – the rest of us were straight off the street. We had one VHS camera, and we made programmes and took them to the television tower. They put it out for us,” recalled Muchnik.
For entertainment, the channel showed American films: they located pirated cassettes at the market and broadcast them, happily oblivious to copyright concerns.
The channel came into its own in August 1991 during the coup from reactionary forces who wanted to restore hardline Soviet rule. As the central television stations went dark, TV2 journalists got updates by calling friends in Moscow and broadcasting the latest news to viewers in Tomsk. Later, TV2 sent a two-person crew to Moscow to film events. The journalists sent the tapes back with pilots flying to Tomsk.
So it was that television viewers in the heart of Siberia got more relevant information than those watching at home in Moscow, thousands of miles away.
In Boris Yeltsin’s Russia, the channel’s journalists felt they were riding on a wave of freedom. Local politicians did not much like TV2, but they felt obliged to come to the studio for interviews.
But then, when Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, things slowly began to change. “I didn’t like him from the start. I didn’t like his KGB background, I didn’t like his smile and his way of speaking,” said Muchnik.
Gradually, the space for free programming began to shrink. It did not help that the channel was purchased by the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who kept his promise not to interfere in editorial policy but left the authorities suspicious that the channel was his personal mouthpiece.
By this time, TV2 was a media holding with several radio stations and two television channels. A nine-story building to house the media group was under construction when Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 in a sign of Putin’s intention to make sure the oligarchs stayed out of politics.
The channel survived Khodorkovsky’s arrest but the pressure on independent media outlets kept increasing. In 2007, the channel received a series of unofficial warnings from Moscow.
“It was made clear: if you want to attack the mayor, that’s fine; if you want to attack the governor, that’s just about OK, but please don’t attack Putin,” said Muchnik.
”And how are you supposed to leave Putin out of it if you want to do journalism in our wonderful country? If you get into any problem, before long you arrive at the Kremlin, because that’s how the system is built,” he said.
The channel continued to host opposition figures such as Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny, banned from the airwaves of most Russian television stations, when they visited Tomsk.
At the end of 2013, TV2 sent a reporting team to Kyiv to cover the first stirrings of the Maidan revolution, and put out reports on the subsequent annexation of Crimea that had a very different flavour from those on state television.
“Our reporting alienated us not only from the authorities but also part of our audience, who started sending us abuse,” said Muchnik.
A month later, the channel was taken off the air, due to supposed technical problems, and at the end of 2014 it was formally closed down. TV2 went from a media holding with more than 250 employees to a website run by a team of 15 people. Authorities refused to register the website as a media outlet, meaning they were banned from attending press conferences or requesting official commentary.
Despite this, TV2 continued to have impact beyond its modest means. During the Covid pandemic, TV2 journalists received calls from doctors, talking of a catastrophe that state television pretended didn’t exist. People sent footage of patients lying on the floor for a lack of beds.
The site broke several Covid-related stories: a man who dressed up as a doctor to care for his grandmother and recorded the awful conditions in the hospital in the process, and a family who were told their grandmother had died, but when they opened the coffin found the body of a stranger.
Working in these conditions was hard yet possible – but the invasion of Ukraine in February was a game-changer.
A new Russian law about “fakes” meant the entire newsroom could be jailed for their coverage. In these conditions, Muchnik took the decision to close down the station.
“We couldn’t convey to people what was happening in their own country, and that hurts me,” said Alexander Sakalov, a TV2 cameraman. “People don’t want to know. They want flowers and birds. Well, now all the independent media in the country will be closed down, and people will get what they wanted,” he said.
Now, from Yerevan, the Muchniks keep in touch with journalists from other independent regional outlets who have also fled Russia, trying to coordinate future work. They are also working on a project called Witnesses, interviewing Russians on their feelings about the war, and how the decision changed their lives. Some are people who have fled but others are still in Russia, and decline offers to be interviewed anonymously.
“Some people feel it’s important to show their faces despite the risks. If you go to a protest, you can just be arrested and nobody will see you, but this is a way for them to register that they do not agree with this war,” said Viktoria.
Many of the interview subjects told the Muchniks they had fallen out with their own families over their opposition to the war, and Viktoria has had similar difficult conversations with her own mother, who is 82 and mainly watches state television.
“She was so upset when we were leaving. She really wanted us to stay, and she said, ‘Why did you have to talk so much, couldn’t you have just kept quiet?’”
Like many recent Russian emigres, the Muchniks feel bitterly disappointed that their long years of work failed to bring about a different kind of Russia, and saddened that they felt they had no choice but to flee.
They hope they will be able to continue to have an influence on politics in Russia from outside the country, but are adamant that they will not return before there is political change.
“It’s very difficult to exist inside this atmosphere of militaristic hysteria. We will not go back until the collapse of the regime,” said Viktor."

Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held a three-way telephone conversation with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday, with the French and German leaders urging Putin to hold “direct serious negotiations” with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The call came as Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s Donbas region continues to grind on. During the 80-minute conversation, the two leaders “insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”, according to a readout from Scholz’s office.
Putin is unlikely to heed such calls. Instead, he warned Macron and Scholz that western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were “dangerous” and risked “further destabilisation of the situation”, according to a Kremlin readout.
Hopes for diplomacy have faded in recent weeks as Russia’s invasion reaches the three-month mark. Although Ukraine is taking heavy losses on the battlefield, there is a widespread belief in the country that agreeing to a negotiated settlement would simply give Russia time to regroup ahead of a further attack.
Russia’s army confirmed on Saturday that it now controls the strategic town of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow’s assault on the Donbas region continues to grind on.
Lyman, a town of 20,000 people, lies on the road to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two of the major Donbas population centres not yet under Russian control.
“The town of Krasny Liman has been entirely liberated from Ukrainian nationalists,” said Russia’s defence ministry in a statement, using the town’s old name.
Ukraine is on the back foot in Donbas, the industrial heartland of the country where Russia-backed forces already seized territory eight years ago and which has now become the centre of Moscow’s Ukraine invasion after the failed attempts to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv.
In his daily video address on Friday evening, Zelenskiy, said the Russians had “concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas”, making life very difficult for the Ukrainian army.
“There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” Zelenskiy said.
Attention this week has been focused on the city of Sievierodonetsk, which if captured would give Russia control of the whole Luhansk region. The city has been under intense artillery and missile bombardment all week, and the Russians have taken control of the Myr hotel on the edge of town.
On Saturday morning, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said the Russians had so far not been able to advance any further than the hotel.
“We have not yet been able to get them out of there, despite their losses. But they are not able to move further either. Their tactics are always the same: a few hours of shelling, and then they try to advance,” he wrote.
Ukraine’s defence minister said foreign military deliveries were helping Ukrainian forces on the frontline, noting three systems that were now in active use against the Russians: M777 and FH70 howitzers as well as the Caesar self-propelled artillery. He also said American M109 howitzer systems had arrived in Ukraine.
“To imagine this back in March would have been impossible. But today it is a reality,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Facebook.
At the same time, Ukrainian officials continue to demand more weapons deliveries from the west, saying they risk being outgunned in Donbas and need the deliveries urgently.
There were reports in Washington that the Pentagon may be preparing to send Ukraine advanced long-range rocket systems to help their battle in the Donbas, something that the Ukrainian army and political leaders have been requesting for months.
Meanwhile, Russian forces also carried out a demonstrative test of a new hypersonic missile on Saturday. The Zircon missile, which was first tested in late 2020, was fired from a frigate in the Barents Sea and hit a target in the White Sea in the Arctic that was 625 miles away, said Russia’s defence ministry.
The Zircon can reach speeds of up to 10-times the speed of sound and flies at a low altitude, making it more difficult to intercept.
Also on Saturday, Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko said he was barred from leaving the country, accusing Zelenskiy of breaking a “political ceasefire” in place since the start of the war. Poroshenko was due to travel to a Nato parliamentary assembly meeting in Vilnius.
Zelenskiy defeated Poroshenko in a 2019 election and before the start of the war prosecutors were investigating Poroshenko over his participation in an allegedly corrupt coal export scheme. Many observers suggested the charges were politically motivated.
After the outbreak of the war, Ukrainian authorities suspended the activities of a number of political parties with pro-Russian platforms, but others were allowed to continue, including Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party. Despite the longstanding acrimony between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko, both appeared to put their quarrels aside to focus on the threat from Russia.
“There is a risk that by this decision, the authorities have broken the ‘political ceasefire’ in place during the war … which one of the pillars of national unity in the face of Russian aggression,” said Poroshenko’s office in a statement."

The son of a Conservative MP has told how he helped save a fellow British volunteer fighter in Ukraine while under heavy Russian gunfire after he was injured by a landmine.
Ben Grant arrived in Ukraine in March, when he told the Guardian he was moved to volunteer after seeing footage of a Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said he went without telling his mother, MP Helen Grant, he was going.
Dramatic video footage, published by the Telegraph, follows the 30-year-old, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a former Royal Marine, screaming: “We’ve got to move now or we’re gonna die!”
Meanwhile, he and others dragged former grenadier guard Dean Arthur to safety after a Russian ambush in a woodland north of Kharkiv earlier this month.
He told the newspaper of his terror, saying: “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”
He said he believes they were spotted by drones beforehand and the Russians had set up their lines so that when they went in, a “mass firefight broke out”.
He added: “I was terrified but driven to complete my most important goal, which at the time was getting him and my team out of the danger.
“What was so scary was being so limited by trying to carry someone, when I can’t pull my weapon up, while there are attack helicopters overhead and tanks firing through the woods. It was unreal – I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”
He said his unit of 15 British and American volunteers and two Ukrainian translators had been preparing an assault on a Russian-held target earlier this month.
The video footage, shot with a helmet-mounted camera, shows them attempting to treat Arthur’s leg with a tourniquet and dressing. They are heard telling him: “You’ve got to try to walk or we’re going to die, mate.”
Arthur lost part of his lower left calf after kneeling on the mine but is now in hospital in Kyiv where doctors saved his leg.
The group were reportedly part of a Ukrainian counter-offensive to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv. In places, they pushed them to the Russian border.
Arthur, 42, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said he was in “excruciating pain”, adding that he was lucky to have escaped alive.
“This type of camaraderie is only forged in these situations. If the coin was flipped, it was one of those guys, I would have got them out,” he said.
The government has advised all British people not to travel to Ukraine, while Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has warned British soldiers they could be prosecuted for desertion if they go to Ukraine to fight.
The Guardian has contacted Helen Grant and the Foreign Office for comment."

An Australian man has died while providing humanitarian aid in war-torn Ukraine, the prime minister has confirmed.
Michael O’Neill, 47, was killed on Wednesday, leaving behind three children as well as five siblings.
“This is a tragedy and I want to give my condolences to the family of the man involved,” Anthony Albanese said in Sydney on Saturday.
“The family has requested that their privacy be respected and I ask the media to do that.”
In a public post on Facebook, one of O’Neill’s sisters said he had been driving trucks in Ukraine to help civilians flee the country as well as helping transport the wounded.
She described her brother as a “larrikin” and “always a battler”.
“Always looking for a cause he headed to Ukraine to drive trucks,” she said.
Russia invaded Ukraine in February, with allegations of war crimes made against the federation’s troops since the invasion.
During his trip to the Quad leaders’ meeting on Tuesday, Albanese said he had expressed Australia’s view that the Russian “unilateral, illegal, immoral attack” on the people of Ukraine was an “outrage”.
“The atrocities which are being committed on innocent civilians is something that we couldn’t have expected in the 21st century,” he told reporters after the meeting.
Earlier this month, the then foreign minister Marise Payne announced further sanctions on high-profile Russians, including media personalities and military higher-ups."

Joe Biden has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to “wipe out” Ukraine’s culture but suggested the plan had at least partially backfired by spurring the expansion of Nato in Europe.
The US president told 1,200 graduating cadets in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday: “Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he’s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people. Attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums, with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.”
The Russian president tried to “Finland-ize” Europe, Biden said, but “instead he Nato-ized all of Europe”, a reference to neutral nations Finland and Sweden’s plans to join the alliance.
On the ground, in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, the situation appeared bleak, with Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, saying Ukrainian forces may need to retreat after Russian troops entered the city, the largest in Donbas still held by Ukraine.
“The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai said on Telegram, referring to Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets river. “We will have enough strength and resources to defend ourselves. However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.”
Haidai said 90% of buildings in the city were damaged.
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accepted the situation in Donbas was “very difficult”, saying in a Friday night address that invading forces “have concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves” to the region.
“There are missiles strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” he said. “We are protecting our land in the way that our current defence resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them.
“If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian.”
Zelenskiy also appealed to European leaders for help with fuel shortages sparked by Russian airstrikes on a refinery in Kremenchuk and on oil depots across the country.
Analysts believe the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed.
Ukraine’s foreign minister offered a bleak assessment of fighting the east. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said.
His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing.
The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told Bloomberg UK that Putin “at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas”. “He’s continuing to make gradual, slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily,” he said.
Russian troops advanced after piercing Ukrainian lines last week in the city of Popasna, south of Sievierodonetsk. Russian ground forces have now captured several villages north-west of Popasna, the UK Ministry of Defence said.
Russia’s eastern gains follow a Ukrainian counter-offensive that pushed Moscow’s forces back from Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv in May. But Ukrainian forces have been unable to attack Russian supply lines to the Donbas.
On Friday, the Moscow branch of Kyiv’s Orthodox church said it was cutting ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, declaring “full independence” in a historic move against Russia’s spiritual authorities.
“We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow ... on the war,” the church said in a statement after holding a council focused on Russia’s “aggression” and declaring the “full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox church”.
“The council condemns war as a violation of God’s commandment ‘You shall not kill!’ and expresses condolences to all those who are suffering in the war,” it said.
Patriarch Kirill has expressed clear support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
It said its relations with the Moscow leadership had been “complicated or absent” since martial law was declared in Ukraine.
The council also appealed to both Ukraine and Russia to “continue the negotiation process” and find a way to “stop the bloodshed”.
Speaking to AFP, church spokesman Archbishop Kliment said of Patriarch Kirill: “Not only did he fail to condemn Russia’s military aggression but he also failed to find words for the suffering Ukrainian people.”
The Russian Orthodox church said it had “not received an official statement from the Ukrainian Orthodox church” and was unable to comment, spokesman Vladimir Legoida wrote on Telegram.
He said the Ukrainian Orthodox church was in “a very difficult position and under pressure from many directions: from the authorities, from schemers, from nationalistic-minded people ... and the media”.
Ukraine has been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership for hundreds of years, since at least the 17th century."

The gloating began just days after the missiles began falling on Ukraine. “Get ready for Nuremberg 2.0,” one former Russian diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message. Vladimir Putin’s invasion to “denazify” the country has always pointed toward a purge and show trials. Now Moscow may seize on that chance.
As Russia holds hundreds of prisoners from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, its proxies in east Ukraine have floated the idea of holding a “military tribunal” inspired by Nuremberg that observers say would reflect a mass show trial meant to justify Russia’s invasion to the world.
“We are planning to organise an international tribunal on the republic’s territory,” said Denis Pushilin, the leader of a Russian-controlled territory in the Donetsk region. A model could be the Kharkiv trial of 1943, he said, when the Soviet military tried, convicted and executed three Germans and one Ukrainian by hanging. One key audience was the world press. Photos of the hangings were printed in Life magazine.
Whether the Kremlin will follow through with such a gruesome spectacle remains unclear, but the idea has found backers in the foreign ministry and among top MPs who have angrily declared that there should be no prisoner exchanges of the soldiers captured in Mariupol. The head of annexed Crimea said that a tribunal in Russian-occupied east Ukraine, where local authorities support the death penalty, would serve as a “lesson for everyone who forgot the lessons of Nuremberg”.
The signalling of a great political trial has raised fears that Russia is about to pass yet another grisly landmark in its reliving of the second world war, simulating a triumphant legal process that would taint the legacy of the Nuremberg verdict. One expert called it an Orwellian distortion of the postwar language of human rights.
It would be “a political trial whose aim is to present a particular narrative about the war that supports the argument about denazification that Putin has been putting forward, that supports his claim that Ukraine is being run by Nazis and that supports his claims that there are direct links between the Ukrainian collaborators during the second world war and Ukrainian soldiers today”, said Francine Hirsch, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal after World War II.
“I think it’s going to be used to try to present what we in the west understand as a fiction as if it’s a reality. That’s what show trials do.”
With a growing focus on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including an international investigation into the massacre of civilians in towns such as Bucha, some observers believe that Moscow may launch a military tribunal as a counter-process as more atrocities are revealed.
“They’re trying to create a counterbalance because of all the talk of the international criminal court and the Ukrainian prosecutions” for war crimes said Philippe Sands, a professor of law at University College London and author of East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity.
“I suspect … they’re creating another form of leverage for what’s going to come in due course.”
Sands has been part of an effort now under discussion to form a special criminal tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression, a charge that was originally coined at the Nuremberg trials of 1945-46 by a Soviet lawyer as “crimes against peace”.
He said there was an irony to Russia’s embrace of a Nuremberg-style process that would ignore any charges for launching an illegal war against Ukraine.
“For me, the crime of aggression is the beating heart of this whole issue,” said Sands. “At the end of the day, if Putin had not gone to war, none of the other crimes would have taken place.”
As part of the history of the second world war, the Nuremberg trials remain a deeply personal issue for the Kremlin. The decision to propose a military tribunal is a dive deeper into what one former adviser called a historical “mania”, where terms like “denazification” are seen as having the potential to mobilise the Russian public.
The Kremlin “thinks this is what the public wants to see … to feel themselves a part of history”, said the former adviser, who has worked with Putin.
He also said he believed that senior officials had bought into their own propaganda about the resurgence of nazism in the west.
History appears to be the wellspring for both the Kremlin’s propaganda and state policy. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council and a top Putin ally, said in an interview this week that its policies for the “denazification” of Ukraine were exactly the same as in Nazi Germany in 1945.
“It’s fanaticism,” the adviser said.
The Nuremberg trials that convicted Nazi war criminals reflected the political divisions of the times. Western representatives were concerned that the Soviets treated them as a repeat of their own show trials of the 1930s. The Soviet judges were appalled when Winston Churchill gave his famous “iron curtain” speech about the menace of communism while the trial was in progress.
Today, Russia has wielded the trial as a shield against accusations of the crimes under Stalin. After the European parliament condemned Russian state propaganda in 2019 for “whitewashing communist crimes and glorifying the Soviet totalitarian regime”, Putin shot back that the statement “challenged the conclusions of the Nuremberg trials” and could “undermine the foundations of the entire postwar Europe”.
“There’s a narrative about Nuremberg that has become really significant. It’s a narrative where the Soviets are the heroes and the Soviets are the victims but they weren’t responsible for any kinds of crimes,” said Hirsch. “There’s a way in which Nuremberg has really become a part of Russia’s patriotic education.”
Now there are new concerns that Russia could use a tribunal modelled on a glorious past to whitewash its new invasion of Ukraine.
“If these kinds of things happen we need to be ready for it and journalists need to really think about how do you cover this,” said Hirsch. “How do you cover something that you know is play-acting but is deadly?”"

Russia is planning a “full-scale victory in Ukraine by autumn” and may again try to take the capital city of Kyiv, according to independent news source Meduza. Officials close to the Kremlin have said confidence has spread to the leadership of United Russia, the country’s ruling party, that a full-scale victory in Ukraine is possible before the end of the year.
The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. “The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” the governor of Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. The Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire.
The Luhansk governor has said Ukrainian forces may be forced to retreat from the zone to avoid being captured. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai posted on Telegram, adding: “However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.”
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the situation in Donbas is “very difficult”. In a short video address, he said Russian forces are concentrated in the coastal region of Ukraine and using “maximum artillery” reserves.
The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has stated that Vladimir Putin is “prepared to discuss a prisoner swap with Ukraine”, after holding talks with the Russian president. Nehammer also said Putin had “given signals that he is quite willing to allow exports via the seaports”, adding: “The real willingness will only become apparent when it ... is actually implemented.”
Russia expects to receive 1tn rubles ($14bn) in additional oil and gas revenues this year, the country’s finance minister announced, noting that the additional income will be spent on Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
The US president, Joe Biden, accused Putin of attempting to “wipe out” Ukrainian culture and identity during a speech. Biden also said that Putin inadvertently “Nato-ized all of Europe” after Sweden and Finland sought out membership in the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The US is expected to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine that could be announced as early as next week, reports CNN. The rocket systems, multiple launch rocket system or MLRS, have been a top request of Ukraine officials who say it is necessary to ward off Russia’s advancements.

Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion.
Peter Beaumont reported this week on Russia’s advances in the Donbas region, with Ukrainian officials admitting that Moscow has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east as defending forces fell back from some of their positions.
Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken, Ukraine’s general staff said that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, which makes up the southern part of the Donbas, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago.
Ukraine’s president has also given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by his forces in the Donbas. “Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.
Shaun Walker has written about the horrors endured by Mariupol’s remaining residents, following the end of Russia’s devastating months-long siege of the city.
He spoke to Svitlana and Vitaly, a couple who lost almost everything, including their unborn baby, before being forced into a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia.
“There’s nothing there,” Vitaly said bitterly. “Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.”
Meanwhile, Andrew Roth reported on Russia’s deployment of mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine.
“The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”.
As prosecutors investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw, and photographer Alessio Mamo revealed the evidence they discovered on the ground: cluster bombs, fléchettes and unguided missiles on residential areas.
On 1 March, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era FAB-250 bombs over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv – explosives designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew.
Bellingcat, a not-for-profit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian and confirmed the presence of cluster bombs in towns and villages occupied by the Russians. The weapons, banned in more than 100 countries (but not the US, Russia or Ukraine) were unleashed in areas with no military personnel and no military infrastructure.
Lorenzo Tondo met Ivan Mishchenko, a farmer in a small village north of Kyiv whose plight mirrors that of hundreds like him and has worsened food insecurity around the world.
Their businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, Mishchenko’s few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling.
“The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” Mishchenko said.
Daniel Boffey reported on eight-year-old Tymofiy Seidov, the last child in a ruined village in north-east Ukraine to be evacuated with his family from the basement in which they lived for three months, after a benefactor read of their plight in the Guardian.
Tymofiy did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, owing to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova.
The family’s evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/russia-guilty-inciting-genocide-ukraine-expert-report;2022-05-27;Russia is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, expert report concludes;"Report by 30 internationally recognised scholars finds ‘reasonable grounds to conclude’ Moscow in breach of Geneva Convention
Russia is guilty of inciting genocide and having the intent to commit genocide in Ukraine, legally obliging other countries to stop it, according to a new report by more than 30 internationally recognised legal scholars and experts.
The report, compiled by two thinktanks, the New Lines Institute in Washington and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights in Montreal, found that there were “reasonable grounds to conclude” that Russia is already in breach of two articles of the 1948 Genocide Convention, by publicly inciting genocide, and by the forcible transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which the report notes is itself a genocidal act under article II of the convention.
The report concludes there is “a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all states to prevent genocide” under the convention. States will not be able to say they were unaware of the risk, it warns, but neither the report nor the 1948 convention stipulates what actions foreign governments should take. The report just notes “a minimum legal obligation on states to take reasonable action to contribute toward preventing genocide and protecting vulnerable Ukrainian civilians from the imminent risk of genocide”.
Joe Biden labelled Russian atrocities in Ukraine as genocide in April, and some other governments have followed suit, though the state department said it was ultimately up to a court to determine. The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, Karim Khan, is leading an investigation of war crimes and has the authority to bring charges of genocide if he feels there is evidence of intent to “destroy, in whole or in part”, the Ukrainian people.
“I’ve never seen anything like this report this early during a conflict,” said Tanya Domi, one of the expert contributors to the report, and an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs. “I think the documentation of crimes in Ukraine outstrips anything that we’ve seen in the recent past.”
The report finds ample evidence of incitement to genocide, noting the Kremlin leadership and Russian state media commentators have consistently denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity, “implying that those who self-identify as Ukrainian threaten the unity of Russia or are Nazis, and are therefore deserving of punishment”.
“Denial of the existence of protected groups is a specific indicator of genocide under the United Nations guide to assessing the risk of mass atrocities,” the report said.
It also looked at the language used by Russian officials depicting Ukrainians as somehow subhuman, with terms like “zombified”, “bestial” or “subordinate”, or as diseased or contaminated, using words like “scum” and “filth”.
“What they’re saying is: if you’re Ukrainian you’re a Nazi, and therefore we’re going to kill you,” Domi said. “They are saying this is a Nazi regime and that means that they are pursuing Ukrainians and the Ukrainian state for the purposes of elimination and destruction.”
By issuing blanket denials of the atrocities and by rewarding soldiers suspected of mass killings, as Putin did with the units that were in Bucha at the time of the mass killings of civilians there, the Kremlin is enabling Russian forces to commit more war crimes and conditioning the Russian public to condone them, the report said.
The public incitement at the time of the invasion points towards a genocidal plan, the experts argue, as does the pattern of atrocities committed: the mass killings, the shelling of shelters and evacuation routes, and the indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas.
In that category, the report points to the sieges of cities such as Mariupol, the 248 attacks on Ukraine’s healthcare system documented by the World Health Organization, and the destruction or seizure of basic necessities, humanitarian aid and grain.
A systematic pattern of rape and sexual violence is also part of an overall picture of atrocities that point towards genocidal intent, the experts said, as is the forcible transfer of over a million people to Russia, including more than 180,000 children. The report cites Ukrainian officials as pointing to planned reforms in Russian legislation to accelerate adoption procedures for children from the Donbas, while abducted Ukrainian children have been forced to take Russian classes.
“I think the forced transfers of people is just one of the most egregious crimes because that shows intent to remove them from their country. There is no ability of those individuals to resist,” Domi said.
The international court of justice ruled in 2007 that state parties to the Genocide Convention had an obligation to take preventive action when they learn of, or should have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed.
“Each state then will determine whether it has the means to help deter those suspected of preparing genocide and take action as the circumstances permit,” David Scheffer, a former US ambassador at large for war crimes issues and now a senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. “There are many options: provision of military weaponry, humanitarian and refugee aid, economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and even military intervention, that complies with the UN Charter.”"

The besieged city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. Russia has continued to make incremental gains in the Donbas region, backed by shelling. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces have surrounded two-thirds of Sievierodonetsk.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east. He said Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality it would probably be necessary to end the war. Russia did not appear to be ready for serious peace talks, he added.
More than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts concluded that Russia is inciting genocide in Ukraine and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people. Their independent report accused the Russian state of violating several articles of the UN Genocide Convention, according to CNN.
The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for frozen peace talks, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the leadership in Kyiv of making “contradictory statements” that do “not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants”.
Ukrainian authorities have issued contradictory statements about their control over the strategic city of Lyman in  Donetsk. A presidential adviser said he had unverified information that Ukraine had lost Lyman, while Ukraine’s armed forces said Russian troops were trying to strengthen their positions in the city. The governor of the region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence. Russian media reported that pro-Russian separatists had seized the city.
Ten people were killed and at least 35 were injured after Russian missile strikes hit the Dnipropetrovsk region in central-eastern Ukraine on Friday morning, according to reports. Regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said rescuers were working in the rubble to look for possible survivors in the aftermath of “an unquiet night and an unquiet morning”.
The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia was making “slow but palpable progress” in Donbas. He said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems to help Kyiv’s embattled forces, but stopped short of committing the UK to send the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks.
Kharkiv was hit by new strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 were injured, authorities said. Residents have been urged to shelter. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said “doctors are providing all necessary assistance” and that there were no further casualties overnight.
Officials in Ukraine have admitted  Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region said only 5% of the area remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas."

After several weeks of deadlock, Russia’s military appears to have found a way to advance in the Donbas – pounding it with such intense, unsophisticated artillery that Ukraine’s exhausted defenders are having to yield.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy rarely gives casualty figures but Ukraine’s president said last Sunday that “50 to 100 Ukrainian troops die on Donbas frontlines each day”, meaning perhaps 3,000 a month in the grisly war of attrition.
Wounded will typically be three or perhaps four times as much, a serious loss for a Donbas defence force estimated at 30,000 before the war began, although the numbers increased following Ukraine’s mass mobilisation.
“Russian forces have secured more terrain in the past week than efforts earlier in May,” reported the Institute for the Study of War on Tuesday, in particular approaching the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and in villages nearby.
“The shelling of Sievierodonetsk is growing exponentially,” said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, which is now 95% controlled by the Russians. He estimated 10,000 Russian troops and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment had been committed to the attack.
The Russian advances are not dramatic but they reflect a new strategy. Gone for now are the attempts at wider encirclements of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, which included a failed river crossing in early May. Instead units are focused on smaller encirclements – or “cauldrons” – and a sheer concentration at Sievierodonetsk.
That was confirmed by the militia head of the self-proclaimed pro-Russian republic in Donetsk, Eduard Basurin, who said Russian forces had adopted an approach of creating smaller encirclements to deprive Ukrainian troops of logistics and reinforcements, rather than pursuing a single large one.
Russian efforts in the Donbas have also been aided by shorter supply lines over the border into Russia as well as a dense network of railway lines in the parts of Luhansk occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014. And forces previously thrown into the failed attempt to take Kyiv continue to arrive.
It follows the appointment by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of Gen Aleksandr Dvornikov to lead the fight. Infamous as the “Butcher of Syria” he also commanded a motor rifle division that devastated Grozny in the late 1990s. Dvornikov has brought the same tactics to Ukraine.
Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the Russians had engaged in “progressive reorientation of their operations towards increasingly modest objectives” allowing them to take villages such as Popasna and Rubizhne, although he argued “their ground forces are still performing badly” as demonstrated by the reliance on artillery.
Others are not so sure. An anxious Kyiv continues to plead with the west for more powerful weapons. The latest demand is for M270 long-range multiple rocket launchers. On Friday, after a to and fro lasting several weeks, it appears the US now appears to be willing to provide some, after previously refusing.
The M270 comes in many versions but it can use missiles with a range of over 100 miles (165km), while the British version has a limit of 52 miles. Both are well beyond anything Ukraine has and would be a significant addition to Kyiv’s arsenal at a time when the country continues to have a pressing requirement for western arms.
When asked what Ukraine needed at present, Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP visiting the UK, said “the first and the foremost is weapons always”, arguing her country and the west “should not underestimate Russia right now” just because Moscow’s forces had, until earlier this week at least, made limited progress in the Donbas.
Rudik said she spoke to Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline every day. But an ongoing problem, she acknowledged, was that it can take two months or more for promised western weaponry to arrive, another reason why Russia may be enjoying a tactical advantage.
Ukraine’s fundamental problem is that while it may have fought off the attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the first phase of the three month-long war, it has not been able to reverse Russia’s territorial gains in the south and east.
That means it has incurred human and economic losses far greater than Russia. Nearly 13 million people have been displaced by the fighting, the UN estimates. Its economy is set to fall 45% this year, according to the World Bank, and the country cannot balance its books. Its strategic exports of grain – 99% of which used to travel by ports blockaded or held by Russia – lie in silos where 22m tonnes are at risk of rotting.
Meanwhile, it may have taken three months for Russia to take the port of Mariupol, ruining and depopulating the city in the process, but this week minesweepers were clearing the beaches and the port, which Moscow hopes to reopen to create a fresh supply line from Russia to the occupied south.
A threat for Ukraine remains western fatigue, or a loss of unity, particularly if a largely stalemated war drags on towards next year. Countries traditionally less hostile to Russia may follow the suggestion of the veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger at the Davos summit this week, to consider pressing Ukraine to agree to a partition.
There are signs Russia is happy with the current pace. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, claimed on Tuesday the offensive was being slowed “deliberately in order to avoid civilian casualties” – and while there is plenty of evidence to the contrary about harm to ordinary Ukrainians from Russian shelling, it also suggests a country being prepared for a longer war.
Phil Osborn, a former head of UK defence intelligence, said the military situation was such that Ukraine needed as much help as it could get.
“The west must focus unremittingly on Ukraine and be prepared for pain. Putin calculates that we will be increasingly distracted (just look at the news cycle moving on and the ‘reasonable’ voices nudging Zelenskiy to settle) and that he has more patience than the west.”"

Boris Johnson has said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to help Kyiv’s embattled forces prevent Russian invaders from gaining ground in the Donbas.
But the prime minister stopped short of committing the UK to sending the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks.
Johnson said the MLRS would enable Ukraine “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go” in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
He added that Putin’s forces were “continuing to chew through ground” in the Donbas region, making “slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress” as they close in on Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukraine.
Johnson’s comments appear to confirm that there has been a significant change of stance over the weapons among western nations.
The US previously rejected Ukraine’s request for the long-range rockets but overnight, briefings suggested that the White House was now willing to supply them. An announcement could come next week, CNN reported, for a weapon that could have a significant impact on the fighting.
Far more powerful than conventional artillery, M270 MLRS rockets have a maximum range of more than 100 miles (165km) and up to 12 projectiles a minute can be fired from an armoured vehicle. Their firepower goes far beyond the original commitment made by Nato members to only send “defensive systems” to Ukraine when the war began.
The British M270 has a range of 52 miles although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles. Ukraine’s existing conventional artillery has a maximum range of roughly 15 miles, including the M177 howitzers supplied by the US army to help fend off the Russians in Donbas.
The surface-to-surface rockets are made by Lockheed Martin and have been bought by the US, UK and nearly 30 other countries. Some smaller countries had been willing to send MLRS weapons via larger third countries, but to the frustration of the Ukrainians the larger nations had not been willing to go ahead.
Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP with the centrist Golos party, said on a visit to the UK that Ukraine was in need of more powerful arms. “There’s this discussion of getting us more MLRS systems. I know that the British government is right now deciding on if they can get to us from the United Kingdom and that will be fantastic. That is something that we exactly need right now,” she said."

More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show, in what looks to be the clearest indication yet of dissent among some parts of security forces over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, came to light on Wednesday, after a local Russian court rejected their collective lawsuit that challenged their earlier sacking.
According to the court’s decision, published on its website, the lawsuit was dismissed after the judge determined that the soldiers had been rightfully fired for “refusing to perform an official assignment” to fight in Ukraine and instead returned to a duty station.
The appeal took place in Nalchik, the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian republic in the Russian Caucasus, where the unit is based.
Since Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, its military has reportedly been plagued by poor morale, with reports of soldiers claiming they did not know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine.
The Pentagon said this month that it had seen “anecdotal reports” that “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level”, had “either refused to obey orders” or were not obeying them with the expected measure of “alacrity”.
Andrei Sabinin, the lawyer who represented the 115 soldiers, said the court’s decision was “unprecedentedly quick” given the complexity of the case.
“I express doubts about the fairness of the process as a whole because my clients were denied to call up certain witnesses and several documents were rejected by the court.”
According to Sabinin, the commanders of the Rosgvardia unit offered the soldiers the option not to fight and their dismissal was illegal.
Russia created Rosgvardia, a militarised force separate from the army, in 2016 to fight terrorism and maintain public order. Since its inception, members of Rosgvardia, which is often referred to as Vladimir Putin’s “private army”, have mostly been involved in crackdowns on peaceful anti-government protests.
Military analysts have linked Russia’s heavy use of Rosgvardia soldiers in Ukraine to Moscow’s strategic aims of capturing and holding major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and the capital, Kyiv. These plans failed, while Rosgvardia units suffered heavy casualties after Ukrainian cities remained battlegrounds rather than being captured by Russia, which left Rosgvardia units exposed to Ukrainian attacks.
Documents acquired by the Guardian on Friday from a separate criminal case against a Siberian journalist further reveal Rosgvardia’s role in Ukraine.
Mikhail Afanasyev, the chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces last month over the website’s reporting on a separate Rosgvardia unit that also refused deployment to Ukraine.
Court testimonies given by members of the Rosgvardia unit mentioned in Afanasyev’s reporting confirm earlier reports that 11 Rosgvardia from Khakassia refused to fight.
The testimonies also give weight to suggestions that the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine was intended initially as a blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv with the aim of capturing the capital.
In one testimony, a Roskgvardia soldier told the court that his commander instructed his unit three days prior to the invasion that they would be sent to Ukraine to “patrol the streets and intersections of Kyiv”.
“The commander explained that all employees of the national guard and the Russian armed forces were assigned specific tasks during the special operation in Ukraine. The task of our detachment and for all the other detachments that were stationed with us was to guard the streets and intersections of Kyiv,” said the testimony, seen by the Guardian.
The content of the court documents was first reported by the regional independent outlet Tayga.info.
A month into the war, Moscow was forced to switch its offensive to more limited objectives after running into fierce Ukrainian resistance, with the army prioritising what it calls the “liberation” of the Donbas region.
But despite a recent string of military successes in the Donbas, the Kremlin this week was confronted with two incidents of rare public dissent from Russian officials.
On Wednesday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war, publishing a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster.” And on Friday, two communist lawmakers from the Khabarovsky Krai in the far east of Siberia urged Putin to end the Ukraine conflict.
“If our country does not halt the military operation then there will be even more orphans in our country,” lawmaker Leonid Vasyukevich said, according to a video of the meeting.
“During a military operation, people become disabled. These are young people who could be of great use to our country,” he added. “We demand an immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops.”

The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces, as the Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire.
“The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. “The residents of Sievierodonetsk have forgotten when was the last time there was silence in the city for at least half an hour.”
As the cities of Kharkiv to the north and Dnipro to the south also came under attack, analysts said the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed.
Underlining the state of the fighting in Donbas, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has cast himself as one of Ukraine’s most vocal cheerleaders, said Russia was making slow but “palpable progress”, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east.
Ukraine’s foreign minister also offered a bleak assessment. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said.
His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems Kyiv for which has been appealing.
On Friday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in Prague that it was appropriate to support Ukraine with tanks and planes if necessary.
Amid the increasingly gloomy news from the campaign in the east, where Ukrainian defenders have been forced to retreat from some positions, Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality that this would probably be necessary to end the war.
“There are things to discuss with the Russian leader. I’m not telling you that to me our people are eager to talk to him, but we have to face the realities of what we are living through,” Zelenskiy said in an address to an Indonesian thinktank.
“What do we want from this meeting? … We want our lives back … We want to reclaim the life of a sovereign country within its own territory,” he said, adding that Russia did not appear to be ready yet for serious peace talks.
In reply, the Kremlin said on Friday it blamed Ukraine for the fact that peace talks between the two countries were frozen, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a call with reporters: “The Ukrainian leadership constantly makes contradictory statements. This does not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants.”
The situation in Sievierodonetsk appeared particularly desperate, with Russian troops reported in some parts of the city.
Its mayor said Russian forces were in the Myr hotel on Thursday, on the city’s outskirts, and that 1,500 people had died in the fighting, while between 12,000 and 13,000 were trapped.
Russia appeared to have gained full control of the strategic town of Lyman, with the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, saying there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence.
Pro-Russia separatists in the Donetsk region said they had “liberated and taken full control of 220 settlements, including Krasny Liman”, using an old name for Lyman.
According to some reports, Ukraine has been increasingly forced to plug the gaps among its defenders in Donbas with volunteers, highlighting the increasing stress on its forces in the region.
Oleh Synehubov, the regional governor of Kharkiv, which lies to the north of Donbas, said nine civilians had been killed in Russian shelling on Thursday.
A five-month-old child and her father were among the dead, while her mother was gravely wounded, he said on social media channels.
An Agence France-Presse reporter in the city said the northern residential district of Pavlove Pole was hit and plumes of smoke rose from the area.
The journalist saw several people wounded near a shuttered shopping centre, while an elderly man with injuries to his arm and leg was carried away by medics.
Commentators believe that Russia’s gains in the three months of war have been far more paltry than Putin originally hoped for, although Moscow has gained control over a handful of cities in southern Ukraine, such as Kherson and Mariupol.
That has been cited as the explanation for the intensity of the Russian effort to take the entirety of Donbas, in what could be painted as a major victory for Putin.
The Kremlin is seeking to tighten its grip over the parts of Ukraine it occupies, including fast-tracking citizenship for residents of areas under Russian control.
The occupying authorities in Mariupol, which was taken over by invading forces this month after a devastating siege that left thousands dead and reduced the city to rubble, have cancelled school holidays to prepare students to switch to a Russian curriculum, according to Kyiv.
Whether Russian forces can advance beyond Donbas and the areas in the south they control is more questionable."
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/27/ukraine-russia-looting-museums;2022-05-27;‘Ukraine’s heritage is under direct attack’: why Russia is looting the country’s museums;"2,000 stolen artworks attest to Putin’s desire to erase a nation’s history – like so many despots before him
As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the director of the Museum of Local History in Melitopol in the south-east of the country, Leila Ibrahimova, arranged for a hoard of gold artefacts from ancient Scythia to be hidden. Just a few weeks later, she was kidnapped and interrogated by Russian troops. They demanded to know where the Scythian gold was; she refused to cooperate. Subsequently the museum’s curator Galina Andriivna Kucher was taken at gunpoint to the museum and asked to show a Russian “expert” and agents where the gold was. She also refused to locate the collection. Kucher was later abducted from her home on 30 April and her whereabouts remains unknown.
According to a report on the theft in the New York Times, Russian troops eventually found the gold hoard, which dates back to the fourth century BC, boxed up in the museum’s basement. The items were taken to Donetsk, in the Russian-controlled Donbas region, for “safety”, with the museum’s newly installed puppet director, Evgeny Gorlachev, stating that the gold artefacts were not just for Ukrainians but “of great cultural value for the entire former Soviet Union”. His carefully chosen words were designed to erase the collection’s Ukrainian heritage and replace it with a Soviet one, one that suggested Ukraine was back within Russia’s sphere of influence and control.
To date, Russian forces have caused the destruction or severe damage of 250 museums and institutions in Ukraine. Twenty-five paintings by Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko were incinerated after the Museum of Local History in Ivankiv was hit by a missile. The Arkhip Kuindzhi museum in the besieged city of Mariupol was badly damaged by an airstrike that left paintings exposed to the elements, hanging on walls amid piles of rubble. The Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, run by the Virginia Museum of Natural History in association with the Smithsonian, has already logged more than 110 memorials destroyed by Russian weapons. But as well as destroying museums and galleries, Russian troops are accused of having stolen an estimated 2,000 artworks. In addition to the theft of the Scythian gold in Melitopol, in Mariupol a handwritten Torah scroll and a valuable gospel printed in Venice in 1811 were all have been taken.
Autocratic leaders seizing art as a means to rewriting a nation’s cultural history and advance their interests is nothing new: in 1937, Hitler confiscated 17,000 works of art from more than 100 German museums in less than a month. Some were shown in his Degenerate Art exhibition but many were destroyed or “lost”. Napoleon had cartloads of masterpieces shipped to Paris from all over Europe: the classical sculptures Apollo Belvedere and Laocoön from Italy; Rubens’s The Descent from the Cross from Belgium. But these latest thefts are in keeping with Putin’s attempts to erase Ukraine’s independent history and promote his own expansionist model of a new Russian empire.
It is clear that Putin sees the Scythian gold as particularly central to Ukraine’s cultural identity and independence. It is not the first time he has tried to claim it for Russia. In 2014, examples of Scythian gold were on loan to the Allard Pierson museum in Amsterdam. Four of the Ukrainian museums that had issued the loans were in Crimea. As Putin invaded and annexed Crimea, he pressed the Netherlands to send the gold back. A protracted legal battle ensued and only in October 2021 did a judge finally rule that the works categorically belonged to the State Museum Fund of Ukraine and not the Russian-controlled Crimean museums (the works remain in the Dutch museum’s stores).
When the paintings that were forcibly removed from Mariupol are also considered, a clear pattern emerges. These works have been chosen to undermine Ukraine’s national identity. Paintings by western European artists have not been targeted, for example. Instead it is the work of Ukrainian-Russian artists that has been stolen. Take 19th-century maritime painter Ivan Aivazovsky. Born in Feodosiya, a Crimean port, he was a leading Romantic artist who painted heavy seas, golden sunsets and storm-tossed ships. The slightly younger Arkhip Kuindzhi, another whose works were taken, was born in Mariupol. His paintings are the calm before Aivazovsky’s storm: landscapes of harmonious tranquillity. Both painters worked in regions that are now in modern-day Ukraine and Russia, and both countries claim the artists as their own. Other works stolen are by Tetyana Yablonska (1917–2005), a politically active Ukrainian painter who was born in Smolensk, Russia, and Mykola Hlushchenko (1901–1977), who lived in Donetsk from an early age but was likewise born in Russia. Russia’s line of thinking seems to be that if it seizes such paintings by Ukrainian-Russian artists then the contested territory they once called home will follow.
There is hope, however. The resilience Ukraine is showing in the war is mirrored by the country’s response to this parallel attack on its culture. At the Venice Biennale, the exhibition This Is Ukraine was crowded with artists, with President Zelenskiy’s handwritten slogan “We are defending our freedom” adorning the side of the building. One of the artists involved, Nikita Kadan, created a work from war-damaged metal shards collected from Donbas during the war of 2014 and the current onslaught. He uses his Instagram account to record damage to Ukrainian museums but also to show how the country is protecting its cultural assets, posting photographs of monuments across the country, wrapped in blankets and tape or surrounded by hundreds of sandbags. All Ukrainians are aware that their heritage is under direct attack.

But can they really help?
On the second floor of the stately King’s College London building on the Strand, Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Joe Biden are sitting around a table studying a map of Ukraine. They are here to negotiate the future of the country, but they all have ulterior objectives too. Germany wants to ensure the safe transit of refugees; the US wants Russia to cease its disinformation campaign; France wants trade; and Russia needs dozens of sanctions to be lifted. But nobody is giving anything away. It’s tense as hell and the clock is ticking.
This is not real, of course, it’s just a game – but it’s a game with serious intentions. Today, the heads of state are being played by four people attending an event organised by the university’s department of war studies. Several students who have taken an MA module entitled Designing Wargames for Education & Analysis are showing games they have created to a select crowd of wargaming professionals, members of the military and representatives of a few big corporations.
Wargaming is essentially the competitive simulation of conflict, usually on some sort of map board with a variety of playing pieces. Chess can be understood as a heavily abstracted version, but there are detailed, complex games based on everything from the unification of Japan (Sekigahara) to apocalyptic sci-fi combat (Warhammer 40,000). Wargames have also been used extensively by military forces for about 200 years in order to plan real-life campaigns and role-play possible outcomes. The UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) has a dedicated Defence Wargaming Centre near Portsmouth, while the US Marine Corps is currently building a Wargaming and Analysis Center at its base in Quantico, Virginia.
One of those attending is an expert from the MoD who assures me the Ukraine invasion has been heavily war-gamed by both Nato and Russian military planners. Indeed, a report published by the Royal United Services Institute in February claimed that Russian forces ran wargames preceding the invasion in order to plan an attack on Ukraine’s infrastructure using assets within the country.
The Ukraine game here today is called War and Change and was designed by Sacha Nacouzi, currently studying for an MA in international security. The main aim for the western countries is to get Russia out of Ukraine, but each country also has to secure its own interests in the region. Meanwhile the player representing Russia must seek to end sanctions, reopen trade routes and get back on the Swift financial system. The action is separated into a series of 10 five-minute rounds, in which players negotiate, swap asset cards and work out mini deals. It’s more like a fantasy role-playing game, especially as Nacouzi encourages players to mimic the personalities and policies of the leaders they are portraying.
When I take part, I get stuck with Donald Trump, who is voted back in to power early in the game. I decide this means I should seek to grab the most valuable Ukrainian territories back from Russia so that I can look like a tough guy, while also reopening US airspace to Russian craft and unfreezing the assets of oligarchs so I can suck up to my pal Putin.
“The game is designed to provide a holistic overview of issues considered in territorial negotiations,” says Nacouzi. “This includes the strategic placements of regions, borders, trade agreements, agrifood exports, economic sanctions, gas and oil.” Her hope is that players come away with a better understanding of the assets countries have at their disposal and the kinds of liabilities they face in complex negotiations.
On a table beside War and Change, another group is playing Guns N’ Money, a game about weapons procurement. Nearby there’s Shooting Daedalus, about the tactics of modern urban combat.
What is interesting about these games is that the students don’t come from the professional wargame sector, so they’re unencumbered by conventional thinking and design rules. “It’s precisely because the students don’t have a professional background that they have a way of thinking of questions or ideas that you wouldn’t otherwise see,” says the event’s organiser, David Banks, a wargaming lecturer and academic director of the Wargaming Network at King’s College London. “One of the designers of the game about urban warfare was an architect – he’s really interested in the use of space. The diversity of life experiences on this course really helps. They don’t fall back on things they’ve learned or played.”
The next game I play illustrates this pretty clearly. Called Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone, it’s a simulation of drone warfare involving two players, one taking part as a drone pilot, the other as their commanding officer. In each round a possible target is identified on the board, which represents a satellite image, and the CO gives the pilot the command to strike. The pilot needs to follow that order or play an action card to question the directive. Each square on the board has a number relating to how many civilians may be killed if an attack goes ahead. Some of the actions are “signature strikes”, where the drone spots someone who looks like, or is behaving like, a known enemy target but their identity is not confirmed. The outcome of each strike is decided by the roll of the dice and if things go wrong, the pilot could be responsible for civilian casualties. When this happens, the player loses moral points, and they need to draw cards that show photographs of their victims. Repeated failures lead to increasing mental health difficulties and eventually incapacitating depression.
It is uncommon for wargames to model psychological outcomes, and I ask the game’s lead designer, Edward McEvoy, if there has been interest from those attending. “Yes,” he says. “Some of the experts we’ve spoken to today think that games that explore the human aspects of war and conflict could give new perspectives that may change certain policies. Perhaps they’ll even lead to less conflict.”
Wargames aren’t employed only by the military. Corporations use them to explore business decisions; government policymakers use them to simulate major events, including pandemics; and they have a role in disaster relief. “The UNHCR has made efforts in various cities to help with the influx of Ukrainian refugees and provide relief to civic centres and to other spaces housing many people and aid workers,” says Lily Boland, co-designer of Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone. “Wargaming and/or simulating some of these crucial aspects of refugee aid work would certainly help organisations like the UN and local institutions to prepare for these scenarios in advance.”
What the situation in Ukraine has shown the world is that the outcomes of military action are becoming less predictable. Russia’s command and control strategy has been found wanting, while Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s innovative and playful use of social media has increased awareness and support for his country in a way that would have been tough to forecast. As Banks puts it, “I’m a huge believer in using historical case studies as much as possible, but a lot of the problems we’re facing in the 21st century are not ones that we have any ready guides for.”
As the world becomes ever more unpredictable and prone to disruptive global events, perhaps new strategies and solutions will be discovered in games like these."

They are doing the opposite;"Amid the horror, we Ukrainians have become kinder towards each other. We are planning ahead – and still determined to win
For the last three months, 600 people have slept in the Heroiv Pratsi metro station in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. The city lies just 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border and has been heavily shelled since the first day of the invasion. Last week, the mayor of Kharkiv urged the temporary residents of Heroiv Pratsi to return to their homes. I first visited Heroiv Pratsi in mid-March, and recently returned to the metro station a few days before the mayor’s announcement. I was amazed by how well-maintained people’s temporary sleeping areas had become since my previous visit. Bouquets of lilac and daffodils had been placed next to almost every mattress.
Nina Maksymivna, an 80-year-old woman who had been staying in Heroiv Pratsi on my last visit, was still sleeping by the stairs in the same place where I had met her in March. Aside from very brief forays outside, she had barely left the underground in two months. It’s still possible to hear sounds of distant explosions in the area. For her, they were too close to feel safe. The Ukrainian army pushed the Russians back from Kharkiv’s outskirts in early May, but local fighting continues.
At 3am during my night in Kharkiv city centre, I was awoken by a loud bang. Still, I’m told this was nothing compared to how the city felt weeks ago. In Saltivka, the most damaged neighbourhood of Kharkiv, which had been inaccessible for some time, all that remains are empty buildings and burnt-out blocks. Russian troops are still stationed less than a mile away. On my recent visit, I met residents returning to check whether any of their belongings had survived. Men and women were cleaning the streets, some obviously shocked to see what remained. A local shipping company was helping people to move fridges and TV sets. “Long live Saltivka,” one of their guys, who was loading a lorry, shouted to me as I passed.
Almost two million people were living in Kharkiv at the start of the war. There are still more than a million left, and many more are now returning. The Kyiv to Kharkiv express trains are now packed. For Ukrainians, the decision to return is rational, but only if two conditions are met: first, if your house survived the shelling, and your water and electricity supply are fixed. Second, if there’s still a chance of getting a job. After three months of war, people’s savings are depleted. Many working-age adults are returning home to Kharkiv, leaving family members and friends to look after kids and elderly relatives in safer towns. But it’s especially hard for families where relatives have joined the army.
Compared to Kharkiv, my native Kyiv feels strangely normal, despite the curfew, the not yet fully operational public transport, and the occasional air-raid siren. Yet the war still goes on. The major battles are being fought in Donbas, in the south of Ukraine. In the newly occupied area around the southern city of Kherson, people are being kidnapped and tortured. I covered the Russian invasion of Donbas and Crimea in 2014. My biggest fear now is that Ukrainians in Kyiv and the west of the country will get used to the distant battles unfolding hundreds of kilometres away, and ignore the war. Last time, the unresolved conflicts in Donbas and Crimea became a pretext for the Kremlin’s full-scale attack.
Yet, finding myself recently at a small party in Kyiv, I know this time it’s different: there is nobody in the country untouched by the war. At the party, I spoke to one of Ukraine’s most famous travel bloggers, who is now making stories not from exotic far-flung locations, but from liberated Ukrainian towns. He is originally from occupied Luhansk, in the east. Every one of us at the party had a friend who had been killed, lost a house, became a refugee or is fighting on the frontline.
As a conflict reporter I know that wars cause societies to disintegrate. But from what I’ve seen, Ukrainians, and in particular Kyiv residents (who were previously known for their briskness and focus on work), have become kinder and warmer. The discussions that prevail are about rebuilding the country for the better. Professionals who helped with the logistics during the first months of the military invasion are now figuring out how their skills might be useful in a new environment. My cousin, an architect, recently called to tell me how his university mates have been united in developing a plan for rebuilding the country’s demolished infrastructure.
I find it hardest to interact with foreign experts and analysts. One veteran reporter from the Balkans recently told me that the longer the war lasted, the less she could understand its goal. Perplexed, I responded that Ukrainians saw the goal even more clearly now than before: to defend cities from invasion while ensuring the fewest possible casualties and to liberate the occupied territories, where the atrocities have been greatest.
Despite the many positive surprises we have seen during the war – including the strength of the Ukrainian army, which has shown itself to be more efficient compared to Russia’s poorly organised troops – for Ukrainians, it is going on exactly as we imagined. We knew that if we were attacked, it would last a long time. I’ve head many times that Ukrainians should manage their expectations, and that “compassion fatigue” is inevitable from the west. But Ukrainians aren’t asking for compassion: we’re asking for solidarity. We’re fighters, not powerless victims.
Yes – Ukrainians are adjusting to the war, and trying to make daily life more bearable, as the people who put flowers near their beds in the Kharkiv metro attest. But this doesn’t mean we have to normalise the conflict. Discussions about rebuilding the country and victory come not from naivety: they are rooted in the knowledge that we can’t afford to waste energy and time explaining why things are impossible. We need to preserve our strength to prove the opposite is true.
In Kyiv, I recently passed by a bookstore that was still open. It sold funny socks with infamous phrases such as “Russian ship, go fuck yourself”. On the label of one pair was written: “Made of 92% cotton, 8% Lycra, and 100% trust in Ukraine”.

An increasingly bitter diplomatic row over Germany’s unwillingness to supply heavy weaponry to Ukraine threatened to spill into a wider dispute between allies over whether they are prepared to accept a peace settlement that leaves Vladimir Putin capable of claiming victory.
One western official said western leaders are divided between those who think they can work with Vladimir Putin’s Russia once the war is over, and those who think they cannot.
The row is leading to disputes over the arming of Ukraine, the feasibility of enforcing a Russian oil import embargo and whether Kyiv will have to accept a further loss of territory at the end of the war as the price for peace.
The immediate point of conflict between Ukraine and some of its allies focusses on the supply of weaponry to Ukraine, and the heavy weather Germany seems to be making in setting up an elaborate chain that would see the country supplying armaments to its Eastern neighbours – principally Poland and the Czech Republic – that would in turn send armoury on to Ukraine.
Kyiv is suffering serious losses due to the absence of long-range weaponry. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the delivery of weapons could not be delayed: “We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to hit the enemy from a long distance.”
Citing its sources in Nato, the national news agency, Deutsche Presse Agentur, reported that alliance members have informally agreed not to supply certain weaponry to Ukraine, fearing Russia could see the delivery of tanks and combat aircraft as the west entering the war and take retaliatory measures. Quite what this decision means in practical terms is disputed.
There were also US-sourced reports that Israel had rejected a US request to allow Germany to send Spike anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Spike missiles are produced in Germany with Israeli technology under an Israeli licence. Since the beginning of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Israel has taken a neutral stance and refused to supply weapons to Ukraine.
The disputes come as some influential US voices, from veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger to the New York Times, have urged Ukraine to realise it may have to lose territory to Putin.
In a reference to the tensions, the UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, a staunch war hawk, warned the West against backsliding and appeasement, insisting the need to supply arms was urgent in a speech in Sarajevo: “What we cannot have is any lifting of sanctions, any appeasement, which will simply make Putin stronger in the longer term.” She insists private sanctions on Russia cannot be lifted until Putin has completely left Ukraine, and his army is irreversibly weakened. She has strong allies in eastern Europe, and the Baltics, but not in Paris or Berlin.
Truss has argued that any backsliding would result in a more prolonged and painful conflict.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, adopted an ironic, almost uncomprehending tone at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week about the slowness of arms deliveries: “We are pursuing this with strategic patience. I don’t understand why this is so difficult.” The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sensed German reticence stemmed from a desire to rebuild relations with Putin once the war ends. “No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: ‘Let’s take his interests into account’,” said Zelenskiy.
Poland has also heavily criticised Germany’s slowness, and within Germany the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has come under attack for appearing not to want either side to emerge victorious from the war, a stance Scholz denies.
Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag Defense Committee and a member of the Free Democrat party, said: “It must not be that at the end of the war the world sees Germany as a complete brakeman and loser just because we are unable to organise and communicate.”
Early in the conflict Germany proposed quickly supplying Ukraine with heavy weaponry in a “ring system” – whereby eastern European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic would provide Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, with these being replenished by modern German Leopard tanks. Whether the failure to achieve this yet is due to bureaucratic inertia, cynical procrastination or a reflection of the depleted state of the German armed forces is hard to unravel. If you are on the frontline, it probably matters little.
In a speech in Davos, Scholz tried to dismiss claims that he did not understand the scale of the issues at stake. He said the 24 February invasion had come like a thunderclap.
He described Putin’s war as “imperialism” that is “trying to bomb us back to a time when war was a common tool. It is not only the statehood of Ukraine at stake but a world order that binds might to law”. He claimed Putin had already missed all of his strategic goals. “A capture of all of Ukraine by Russia seems further away today than it was at the beginning of the war. More than ever, Ukraine is emphasising its European future.”
He added that “our goal is clear. Putin must not win this war”. His remarks, insisting there can be no peace dictated by Putin, contrast with those of Boris Johnson, who has always insisted Putin must lose the war and be seen to lose the war.
Truss was one of the first European figures to echo Ukrainian claims that it cannot lose territory in the war, but must regain land lost to Russian separatists since 2014. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, in Kyiv this week said: “Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future. No decisions can be taken about its future without it.” Although there are different voices within the Ukrainian diplomatic landscape, Zelenskiy’s public position appears to be broadly the same. He told a meeting at Davos that he joined by video link: “When Ukraine says it is fighting to regain its territories, it means that Ukraine will fight until it restores all of its territory. It doesn’t mean anything else. It’s about our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our independence.”
He added: “This state of ‘hot’ hostilities, of bloody war, can only move into diplomatic negotiations with the authentic participation of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, supported by our strategic partners, when we see that the Russian Federation shows real willingness and desire to move from bloody war to diplomacy. This will be possible only when Russia concedes at least something, such as pulling back troops to the borders as they were on February 24.”
At present there does not seem to be any likelihood of Russia signalling such a retreat. Quite the opposite.
But that does not mean countries are not coming forward to offer their mediation services. Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, for instance, has assembled a complex four-point plan that was formally presented to the UN secretary general, António Guterres.
The first step in the plan would involve a supervised ceasefire and “demilitarisation” of the frontline. This would be a multilateral negotiation at a conference on the future status of Ukraine, resuscitating the proposal of future Ukrainian neutrality backed by security guarantees provided by major powers. This could give a security umbrella to Ukraine before the end of the peace process, and act as a substitute for Ukraine’s one-time aspiration to Nato membership.
The next stage would be a bilateral treaty between Ukraine and Russia on “border issues”. The language of the proposal points to free movement of people and economic life, de facto autonomy for the occupied territories and a single economic zone, as well as civil guarantees for Russian minorities, including over language. This would be very close to the Minsk agreement, a format that France and Germany oversaw and the Ukrainians never liked.
The final stage would be a grand bargain on EU/Nato-Russia relations, revival of strategic stability talks, a new role for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and a revisiting of some of the other issues that were being discussed between the US and Russia last summer.
Russia seemed to take great pleasure in ridiculing both the plan and its proponent. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev blasted Draghi’s proposals: “It seems that it was prepared not by diplomats, but by local political scientists who have read provincial newspapers and operate only with Ukrainian fakes.” Yet other voices in Russia think there are aspects of the plan that could be adopted later, when both sides have fought themselves to a standstill."

Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages.
Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least nine people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city.
“There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks.
The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure.
The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre.
“For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said.
The booms of incoming and outgoing artillery fire were audible throughout Thursday, shaking buildings and setting off car alarms in central Kharkiv.
In the afternoon, a deep shell crater was left on Otakara Yarosha Street in front of a block of flats from which the windows on all five floors had been blown out. Police at the scene said they did not know how many people had died there.
Outside the 23 August metro station, a blast had brought down large branches from several trees, and dead pigeons and tangled electricity cables lay scattered across a wide expanse of concrete. Shrapnel had torn holes in a nearby second world war monument.
It was not immediately obvious whether people had died at the scene, and there were few people around to ask, as air raid sirens and the booms of artillery sounded.
A steady flow of residents had started to return to their homes in the city. A few cafes and restaurants had opened, people were strolling in city parks on Thursday morning and this week, and the metro began operating again for the first time since the invasion. In recent weeks, its main use has been as a bomb shelter, with thousands living on its underground platforms.
The city mayor, Ihor Terekhov, told residents: “We will not stop the metro, but we will allocate special sectors where you can stay and shelter from bombing.”
After Russia failed in its assaults on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the early days of the war, Moscow has concentrated much of its efforts on a bloody offensive to take more territory in the Donbas region. But Thursday’s attacks raised fears that Kharkiv could still be on the agenda.
“The Russian troops are engaged in a counter-offensive, and are trying to reoccupy territories that were liberated by our troops just a month ago,” said Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region’s chief prosecutor, in an interview with the Guardian. He said he believed the ultimate aim was to launch a renewed assault on the city itself.
Filchakov also noted reports that Russian troops were unloading Iskander missiles at the railway station in Belgorod, just across the border.
For now, said Synehubov, a renewed ground assault on the city was not possible. “They are firing from the positions they have held for a long time; they are constantly trying to counterattack but our forces are holding their positions.”
He said there was not a significant enough buildup of new troops and equipment on the other side of the border to signal the capacity for a new assault on the city. “But that’s right now, and the situation can change at any minute,” he added.
However, Synehubov said, the main problem for the Kharkiv region, unlike others, was that the Russians continued to shell settlements after they had retreated.
“In Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv regions, the Russians fought for a certain period, realised they had hit a wall and then took the decision to retreat, and they retreated fully from these territories,” he said.
“Here, even if we liberate a place, then the enemy stays in its positions and keeps hitting it, and we can’t properly evacuate people, we can’t bring humanitarian aid, because these places are under permanent fire. We can’t bring in de-mining teams because of the shelling, so we need to push the enemy back even further so they would focus on our positions and not on population centres,” he said."

A British man who has turned his Polish castle into a makeshift hotel for Ukrainian refugees has accused the UK government of showing “no humanity whatsoever” for not allowing a severely autistic teenager to come to live with an approved foster carer in Lancashire.
Pleas are mounting for compassion to be shown to Timothy Tymoshenko, 16, who fled the war in Ukraine without his parents. He is living with his 17-year-old brother, Yurii, in what was once a private palace for the prince-bishop of Wrocław in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border.
Jim Parton, a former stockbroker and writer from London, lives there with his Polish wife, Anna, and their six children, aged seven to 17.
When the Russian invasion began in February, they decided to turn what is usually a guest house and wedding venue into an open house for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary abroad.
They are currently hosting 17 people in the sprawling 700-year-old palace, after four left for Canada on Monday. Among those remaining is Timothy, who is severely autistic, non-verbal and needs strong prescription medication to control his changing moods.
Experienced children’s carers in Lancashire have been to visit the boys in Poland and are willing to take brothers in, but are growing increasingly frustrated that the UK government hasn’t yet granted them visas to enter the country.
Julie Elliot, 61, and her husband, Roger, 66, already have 14 children together – four biological and 10 adopted. Both worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers to their adopted family, and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children.
Their adopted children, aged between nine and 40, all have disabilities and eight of them still live at the couple’s home in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire.
They and Parton are pleading with the Home Office to let Timothy come to the UK along with his brother. They do not qualify for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as unaccompanied children under 18.
The issue is the subject of a high court challenge and dozens of UK foster carers are anxiously waiting to see if approval is granted for the children they hope to care for to be brought to the UK.
Parton is growing increasingly frustrated with the visa situation. “It’s an absolute disgrace that it is taking so long. There’s no humanity whatsoever from the government in recognising that this is a special case,” he said.
“What makes me most cross is the safeguarding reason for delaying visas for these children,” said Julie Elliot, who recently travelled to Poland to meet Timothy and Yurii and help look after Timothy for a week.
On arrival, she found him to be hungry, unwashed and dehydrated. “Tim needs someone to care for him to ensure he eats and drinks regularly,” she said.
The boys’ mother, Anna, sent the two brothers across the border because Timothy was not coping with the interruption to his routine by having to hurry into underground bomb shelters and was getting very distressed at the sound of the constant warning sirens.
“Tim is in a very unsafe situation,” said Elliot. “We have been through 10 adoption assessments and they are the most frightening thing on God’s earth but they don’t compare with this process of trying to get a visa for Tim. There doesn’t seem to be a system in place. I was told we should hear something about the legal case in 14 days but that is a long time when you’re a child and nobody’s looking after you … All I’m asking for these children like Tim who are waiting to be fostered is just give them a visa, they’re not going to be any trouble to anyone.”
Anna is also frustrated about the delays in granting the visas: “When the generous people of Britain extended a helping hand to my family we cannot grab it because the documents will not be issued. As a mother I am under a lot of stress and want to breathe a sigh of relief that my children are not under shelling and are under supervision of responsible and kind people,” she said.
A government spokesperson said: “It is tragic that children have been caught up in Putin’s war. The safety and wellbeing of children is paramount and it is vital we have robust safeguarding processes. For this reason, only under-18s who are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK are currently eligible for Homes for Ukraine. We keep eligibility for all schemes under review.”"

Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east, as Ukrainian forces fell back from some of their positions in the Donbas region.
Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken by Russian forces, Ukraine’s general staff reported that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.
The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas.
“It is clear that our boys are slowly retreating to more fortified positions – we need to hold back this horde,” Haidai said. Hinting at further withdrawals, he said it was possible that troops would leave “one settlement, maybe two. We need to win the war, not the battle.”
Separately, a senior Ukrainian military official conceded at a briefing on Thursday that Russia had the upper hand in fighting in Luhansk. “Russia has the advantage, but we are doing everything we can,” Gen Oleksiy Gromov said.
Haidai said police in Lysychansk were burying the bodies of civilians in mass graves, with about 150 people having been buried in such a grave in one district.
If confirmed, Russia’s continuing advances in Lyman, which has been contested for a month, would make it easier for Russian forces to isolate the key city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under relentless shelling for days.
According to accounts posted on social media, Lyman’s Ukrainian defenders had pulled back to the southern outskirts, although fighting was continuing, in particular around the railway sidings in the city.
Outside Sievierodonetsk, now the focal point of Moscow’s renewed offensive in Donbas, Haidai said fighting was “very difficult”.
Predicting the “coming week will be decisive”, Haidai said the city was being subjected to a “colossal amount of shelling” by Russian troops attempting to batter it into submission.
After failing to seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or its second city, Kharkiv, in its three-month war, Russia is trying to take full control of Donbas, comprising two eastern provinces that Russia claims on behalf of separatists.
Moscow has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.
Their fall would leave the whole of Luhansk province under Russian control, a main aim of the Kremlin’s war.
Meanwhile the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, issued a bitter rebuke to the west for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war.
Calling for help “without limits”, specifically shipments of heavy weaponry, he also criticised recent suggestions that a negotiated peace deal could include territorial concessions.
Zelenskiy has said Russian troops heavily outnumber Ukrainian forces in some parts of the east, and Kyiv has been trying unsuccessfully to arrange a prisoner swap with Moscow.
The heavy attrition on Ukrainian defenders in the east – where between 50 and 100 soldiers are dying every day, according to Zelenskiy – has also led to claims by Russia of large numbers of prisoners being taken.
Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russia-backed self-proclaimed people’s republics of Luhansk and Donetsk number about 8,000, the Luhansk official, Rodion Miroshnik, was quoted by Tass news agency as saying.
“There are a lot of prisoners,” Miroshnik said. “Now the total number is somewhere in the region of 8,000. That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day.” His claims could not be verified.
As Russia seeks to solidify its grip on the territory it has seized, Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process for residents of newly captured districts to acquire Russian citizenship and passports.
The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops.
In a late-night video address, Zelenskiy said of the changes to the Russian enlistment rules: “[They] no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight. It will still take time to crush this will.”
Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the World Economic Forum in Davos his country “badly” needed multiple-launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower in the battle for Donbas.
In the eastern town of Soledar, Ukraine’s salt manufacturing hub, the ground shook moments after Natalia Timofeyenko climbed out of her bunker on Wednesday.
“I go outside just to see people. I know that there is shelling out there but I go,” the 47-year-old said after a blast smashed apart a chunk of a salt mine where she worked with most of her friends and neighbours.

Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine.
Videos published by the Russian ministry of emergency situations showed the vans, which it called “mobile information complexes”, playing state TV news segments and political chat shows where pundits support the invasion to locals in the ruined city that still lacks electricity and running water.
The Orwellian turn comes as much of Mariupol was destroyed in an artillery bombardment that left thousands dead. One of the vans was deployed near the ruins of the Mariupol drama theatre, where hundreds were killed in an airstrike in March.
Several of the trucks now patrol the city, mainly playing Russian television news segments. “The people of Mariupol have been held in a virtual informational vacuum for three months due to the lack of electricity,” wrote the emergencies ministry in a statement.
The mobile screens have reportedly been deployed to places where Mariupol residents are receiving humanitarian aid, Russian documents, and at points in the city where drinking water is available.
“The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”.
“The truth and the propaganda,” wrote Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, posting a video of the trucks superimposed over images of the ruins of the city. This is “the Russian world”, he added.
The effort to install Russian propaganda in the ruined city is part of a larger effort at pacifying and integrating captured cities like Mariupol despite earlier assurances by Vladimir Putin that Russia did not seek to occupy new territory in Ukraine.
Putin on Wednesday signed a law that would fast-track applications for citizenship from Mariupol, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are partly under government control.
The Kremlin decision has been decried as “passportisation”, an attempt to annex the territories by filling them with de facto Russian citizens.
Senior Kremlin officials have already promised to remain in southern Ukraine “for ever”.
“The simplified system will allow all of us to clearly see that Russia is here not just for a long time but for ever,” the Moscow-appointed deputy leader of the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency.
“The illegal issuing of passports … is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Russian-controlled administration in Kherson also announced that it would begin issuing salaries in roubles on Thursday, effectively adopting Russia’s currency as part of the creeping annexation of southern Ukrainian territories.
Local authorities installed by Russia have also said they may formally request annexation."

The UK government introduced legislation on Thursday to help councils, NHS trusts and other public bodies exit contracts with Gazprom and other Russian companies
Councils have been keen to withdraw from contracts amid concerns they were helping to fund Vladimir Putin’s regime. They had been prohibited from taking “non-commercial considerations” into account when procuring or terminating contracts, and they have a statutory duty to find the cheapest deal on behalf of the taxpayer.
Many councils had been forced to select Gazprom as a supplier because it offered the greatest value for money. They paid £29m to Gazprom from 2016 to 2021, data firm Tussell has said.
In March, the Cabinet Office asked central government to review all contracts with Russia and Belarus-linked firms and to consider terminating those contracts. This process has now been extended to local councils.
Councils including Merton and Telford and Wrekin have said they are keen to cut ties with Russia.
A government source said: “Local authorities are not obliged to terminate contracts, but our message is clear: Putin’s barbaric regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.”
The communities secretary, Michael Gove, will now write to all councils to make them aware of the changes.
The government has said any costs incurred from exiting contracts will have to be covered by existing budgets.
The west is attempting to choke off the Russian economy to damage Putin’s war coffers and fuel anti-war sentiment among the Russian public.
A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Businesses with links to Putin’s murderous regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.
“These measures will allow councils to terminate existing contracts – ensuring public money does not fund these organisations or Putin’s barbaric war machine.”
Research for the Guardian and Tussell shows that councils and NHS trusts have paid nearly £5m to Russian firms including Gazprom since the invasion of Ukraine under existing contracts.
NHS trusts – including Manchester University NHS foundation trust and the Southport & Ormskirk hospital NHS trust – have paid £3.2m. Councils including Portsmouth and Buckinghamshire have paid £1.6m.
Separately, a Treasury deadline to halt payments to Gazprombank and its subsidiaries for gas going from the UK to European Union countries is fast approaching. An original deadline of 21 April to halt payments was extended to 31 May last month. Many large Gazprom gas contract holders are based in the UK and help supply gas to the EU, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia.
Gazprom’s UK arm is the largest non-UK supplier of gas to businesses and public bodies. Its market share was 22% before the invasion of Ukraine and it supplied gas to 178,000 sites, with contracts worth approximately £4bn, according to Capital Monitor estimates."

On the final day of March, soldiers of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic entered the basement in Mariupol where Svitlana and Vitaly were sheltering.
“You have 15 minutes to get ready and then you’re leaving,” shouted one, waving an automatic rifle.
It was, according to the Russian narrative of its Ukraine invasion, the day that Svitlana and Vitaly were liberated. But it did not feel much like that to them.
Instead, it was merely the end of one ordeal and the start of another: a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia.
The siege, destruction and ultimate Russian conquest of Mariupol have been well-documented, but Svitlana and Vitaly’s experiences provide a particularly vivid illustration of the unexpected terror that was visited on this city of half a million people over the past months.
Until late February, the couple lived in a compact but cosy one-room apartment on the eastern side of Mariupol, with Svitlana’s two children from a previous marriage. She worked in a school, he had a factory job. She was three months pregnant and the couple were looking forward to their first child together.
Over the next two months, they lost almost everything.
They had not paid much attention to the warnings that Russia could launch a new war in Ukraine, but they could see and hear the first incoming fire on 24 February from their windows.
It soon became clear that it was too dangerous to stay sleeping in the apartment, but their block’s cellar was not fit for habitation, so instead most residents moved to the stairwell, laying out makeshift mattresses on the hard concrete floors.
Gradually, they settled into a routine. In the first days, there were lulls in the shelling and they could scurry outside to buy food. They bought two chickens from an acquaintance with a garden; with someone else, they swapped a bottle of vodka for some potatoes.
They cooked over open fire in the courtyard, though at times even that seemed too dangerous, as the artillery shells flew in with increasing frequency. Once every two days, Vitaly would risk his life to venture out to a well and bring water for the family. Some days, he took Svitlana’s 13-year-old son with him, so they could carry more water back. In the night, it was sometimes so cold in the stairwell that the bottles of water turned to ice.
One day, when Vitaly began to lower the bucket into the well, he saw there were dead bodies floating far down below. He assumed they had jumped in to take cover during unexpected shelling, but had then fallen and drowned. He set off to find another well, with clean water.
On one water run, a shell landed so close to Vitaly that he was thrown to the ground by the blast. “He came back home with these crazy eyes, he was making no sense, I thought I’d lost him forever,” said Svitlana. The next day, his cognitive function was better, but he lost hearing in his right ear for the next two months.
How many people in their building were killed? Vitaly counted, slowly: “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight people we knew personally, just from our section of the block. And in the neighbouring block it was much, much worse,” he said.
From the blown-out windows of the upper floors of their building, they could see plumes of smoke rising across Mariupol. Svitlana wondered about her parents on the other side of town. She had no idea if they were still alive, and no way of finding out. There was no electricity and no phone reception.
On days when there were deaths, a group of men from the block buried the bodies in the courtyard, working as quickly as possible to minimise the time spent outside. It was the old people who died first.
“I knew those old women all my life. They sat outside the apartment block on the benches, chatting away, passing the time. And then you have to close the eyes of those women and bury them in their own courtyard,” said Vitaly.
Five times, Grad missiles hit their apartment block, as Russian forces haphazardly attempted to target detachments of Ukrainian forces that had based themselves nearby. Vitaly and Svitlana’s flat caught fire after one of the strikes. By the time the flames died down, everything had been destroyed; even the wall between the kitchen and the living room had been incinerated.
The cold nights, the lack of food and the constant bombardment were hard to stand. Svitlana’s daughter had bouts of hysteria and screaming. An old man on one floor kept asking the same question: “When will it end?” On another floor, a woman refused food. It would be better to end things sooner, she said quietly.
On 17 March, after another rocket attack, Svitlana lost her pregnancy. She was bleeding heavily and feverish, but there was no chance to receive proper medical care. On the third day, one of the neighbours managed to find an ampoule of Oxytocin; Svitlana injected it herself and blood started flowing more freely.
“I’m not 15, I know how these things work,” she said, when asked how she knew how to inject the medicine. It may have saved her life.
After the miscarriage, the neighbours rallied around Svitlana with the few provisions they had left. Someone rustled up some vitamin pills. Someone else found a miraculously uneaten piece of cheese. She continued to bleed periodically, but felt as if she might survive.
One morning, a part of the apartment block was hit by an airstrike, causing the entire building to shake and debris to fall from the ceiling and walls. As they regained composure, they could hear wailing from the ninth floor, where a woman had remained, living with her 11-year-old son throughout the bombardment.
Vitaly rushed upstairs. He could see the boy’s arms and legs sticking out from under a pile of bricks and debris. He worked him free. The boy was shocked, but unhurt. His mother was dead.
They were not able to bury her in the courtyard like the others; she had not been a slim woman, and it was too much to carry her down from the ninth floor. So they left her under the rubble.
Afterwards, the boy displayed few emotions. He did not cry. He politely said thank you when someone gave him food, or a hug. But then, in the nights, he would let out terrible piercing screams amid his fitful bursts of sleep.
Soon after the airstrike, the family moved to the basement of a neighbouring house, where another group of people were already sheltering. They took the boy with them.
After a week living in the cellar, with only the briefest forays above ground during which the shelling seemed to have intensified further, the Russia-backed forces arrived on 31 March and ordered everyone out of the cellar.
When the group emerged above ground, they were ordered to walk for half an hour, carrying their possessions with them and with shells flying overhead, to a spot where they joined others from the district. Women and children were crammed into buses while the men continued on foot.
In the village of Sartana, Vitaly and some other men were put into the back of a truck that reeked of corpses. Nobody explained anything about where they were going or what would happen next.
Svitlana and Vitaly were reunited in the town of Novoazovsk, part of the Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic, where they were housed in a school, 20 people to a classroom. There was nothing to sleep on, but they were given hot food. Soldiers confiscated their phones.
They left the boy whose mother had died in Novoazovsk; his estranged Russian father would come to pick him up, they hoped. His father would take him to live in Russia, the country whose assault had killed his mother.
After some days, Svitlana, Vitaly and the two children were again loaded on to buses, and driven to the town of Dokuchayevsk, where they joined hundreds of people waiting in the local Soviet-era House of Culture to undergo what the Russians have termed a “filtration” procedure.
Svitlana was allowed into the mothers and children room; Vitaly was held in the main hall, where hundreds of men tried to grab a few hours sleep slumped on chairs. The smell was disgusting.
The mothers and children room was hardly any better. Many of the children had diarrhoea or dysentery; Svitlana’s daughter was vomiting frequently. She herself still felt weak. There was almost no food: breakfast was tea, lunch was hot water and a biscuit.
After two days, it was Vitaly’s turn for filtration. He was taken to the police station, where he was ordered to undress fully and examined for tattoos that might give away a Ukrainian nationalist affiliation. Then he was questioned, photographed and fingerprinted. The process took five hours. After that, the family were put on a bus to the border with Russia. They crossed after another round of questioning, and spent the night at a camp on the other side, from where the next morning yet another bus drove them to the train station in the city of Taganrog.
In the filtration camps, Mariupol residents had been told they would be given resources to start a new life anywhere they wanted in the Russian Federation. But when they arrived at the station in Taganrog, there was one train, departing to Saransk, a dusty city 300 miles east of Moscow.
For those who did not have their own travel plans, Saransk was the only option. Exhausted, weary and unwashed, they boarded the train to an uncertain new life.
Svitlana had found a better option. She had managed to contact a friend who had an acquaintance in Taganrog, who agreed to put the family up for three days. For the first time in two months, Svitlana and Vitaly slept in real beds and had hot showers.
They told their host in Taganrog a little about what they had been through, and the woman was incredulous. But they did not go into detail.
“We didn’t want to say too much about what we had seen while we were still in Russia; we didn’t want to attract attention, we wanted to be able to leave,” said Svitlana.
She was still regularly bleeding from the miscarriage. Some of her skin had attained a blueish hue, and her legs were swollen “like a bear”, she said. On occasion, she fainted. But she did not seek medical treatment. Spending time inside Russia after the weeks of misery they had been through felt like further abuse, and she wanted to get out as soon as possible.
From Taganrog, the family took a train to Moscow, then to St Petersburg. From there, they crossed to Estonia without problems, and made their way onwards to a western European country, where they are now trying to make a new home.
Soon after their arrival, doctors performed an operation on Svitlana that she should have had weeks earlier. Slowly, her life is getting back to normal. The children have calmed down a little. The aches and pains have dissipated and the swelling in her legs has subsided. She no longer jumps in fear every time someone opens or closes a door, and she can recount the awful ordeal she went through with clarity and poise.
But the nights are harder than the days. Almost every night, Svitlana has visions of incoming artillery and missiles. She wakes up breathless and terrified.
Many of the couple’s friends have simply disappeared. Are they still in Mariupol? Trying to start a new life after being dumped somewhere in a far-flung corner of Russia? Dead? They have no idea.
Svitlana does know that her parents survived the siege of Mariupol. She has not spoken to them since the beginning of the war, and they do not currently have working phones. But twice, they called Svitlana’s sister from a borrowed phone, to give notice they were still alive.
Svitlana has no more information than that; she does not know what horrors they went through in their part of the city, though she can guess it was not easy. It was not easy for anyone in Mariupol.
Svitlana and Vitaly are pseudonyms. They asked not to use their real names, or give their address in Mariupol, because they fear for Svitlana’s parents. She hopes that soon, they too will be able to leave for Europe; she knows her father would not want to live under Russian rule, she said. The fate of her parents is a constant worry that prevents her focusing fully on starting a new life in Europe.
One thing Vitaly and Svitlana are both certain of is that they will never go back.
“Return to what?” asked Vitaly, bitterly. “There’s nothing there. Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.”"

Russia’s offensive in the Donbas region is making slow progress. Having rushed to launch the operation to avoid giving Ukraine time to bring up new weapons from the west, Russia has found that its depleted and exhausted units are unwilling and unable to assault Ukrainian positions without incurring unacceptable losses. The Russian army has, therefore, fallen back on the mass application of artillery, destroying village after village, which they occupy after Ukrainian units withdraw.
For the Ukrainian military, the current Russian tactics may be unsophisticated and nihilistic, but they are also dangerous. To stop the Russians from advancing, the Ukrainian armed forces must occupy the ground. This subjects their units to heavy bombardment, and is producing a steady accumulation of Ukrainian casualties. The Ukrainians are trying to limit the weight of Russian fire by raiding and striking the logistics supporting the Russian artillery.
The challenge for the Russian military is maintaining troop levels. Moscow has begun an unannounced mobilisation of citizens with former military service, complementing a recruitment drive for volunteers to take up short-term service contracts. The short-term contracts are intended to keep up the strength of units until mobilised personnel are organised and equipped. But with little training, low morale, poor unit cohesion following significant casualties and a steady influx of new personnel, Russian units continue to perform badly and suffer disproportionately in engagements.
Although the short-term military trends currently favour Ukraine, the country faces hard choices. So long as Russia has a significant number of artillery systems and its air defences deny Ukraine air support, the Ukrainian military is forced to remain dispersed, limiting its available combat power at any one point and slowing the rate at which it can liberate territory. Ukraine must also guard against the risk that Russia moves into a large and more overt mobilisation of its population that, while politically risky, would threaten a significant offensive late in the year, requiring Ukraine to hold forces in reserve.
If the Ukrainian military cannot liberate significant tracts of territory or bleed out the Russian army this summer then there is the risk of a protracted conflict. The principal security concerns for Kyiv are economic and political. Without a peace settlement, Ukraine will remain economically paralysed, its ports blockaded, its cities heavily damaged, and investment or reconstruction deterred by the ever looming prospect of missile strikes. Kyiv is expected to lose almost half of its GDP this year. Many internally displaced Ukrainians have been living off their savings. These will begin to run out.
A protracted conflict also risks damaging internal cohesion. Ukraine has so far been politically unified, with Russia’s sympathisers in the Ukrainian state keeping a low profile or enthusiastically supporting the war effort. It would be dangerous to do anything else. As curfews and movement controls are lifted, however, and the political clarity of the need to defend Kyiv dissipates, there are renewed opportunities for subversion. How the government ensures it can provide heating for citizens away from the front as winter approaches, for example, is an issue over which criticism may be justified. But such issues can also be weaponised by Russia to degrade the country’s internal unity.
In a protracted conflict, Ukraine will probably depend upon financial assistance from abroad, but it is also likely to need that assistance precisely when its international partners are under the greatest economic strain. Inflation in the UK is approaching 10%. There is a serious risk of recession. If job losses come in the autumn, it will coincide with people’s renewed need to heat their homes. Energy prices, meanwhile, are expected to remain high, and Russia has so far kept supplying Europe. Under these conditions European citizens may become less supportive of aiding Ukraine to fight a grinding war in Donbas when there is acute pain felt at home.
Given these dark clouds on the horizon, Ukraine’s partners must pursue two courses of action. First, Ukraine must improve its security position as much as possible over the summer. To do this it requires long-range artillery that can challenge Russia’s fires dominance. The US provision of M777 155mm howitzers is a good start. Ukraine’s partners must also help in training new Ukrainian brigades so that the country can withdraw and reconstitute some of its units. It is also critical that the Russian army not be given the opportunity to recover the initiative. To prevent this, it is important to keep the rate of Russian casualties in Donbas high, so that mobilised personnel have to be immediately pushed into maintaining Russian positions rather than organised into new units able to open up new axes.
The second line of effort must be a coordinated approach across Europe to build resilience for this winter and to begin working out the best means of offering economic support to Ukraine. There is also a need to inform the public early and clearly as to the direct correlation between Russia’s actions and the economic pain to come. Russian disinformation will inevitably portray the economic pain as a consequence of supporting Kyiv. Such distortions need to be preemptively undermined.
Finally, there is the question of alliance unity. There are growing calls across Nato to consider negotiated solutions, often premised on trading Ukrainian territory for peace. While negotiations should never be abandoned, pushing for a ceasefire that would lock in Russian gains, allow the Russian army to recover and prepare for a renewed offensive and leave Ukraine economically crippled, is deeply naive. It is vital that the disagreements about objectives between key European partners are thrashed out and resolved as soon as possible. As Ukrainian citizens are put through filtration camps, and Russia plots the annexation of more of its territory, it must be understood that peace on Russia’s terms would be a very violent affair.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/putin-anarchists-join-ukraine-war-effort;2022-05-26;‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’: anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort;"Activists from Kyiv and around world join state forces in fight against totalitarianism
In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight.
It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.”
He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine.
“His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grassroots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.”
The activist left is relatively small in Ukraine, where the memory of Soviet communism lingers, and its anarchist component is even smaller. But from 1917-21 Ukraine was home to one of the world’s most famous anarchist movements, which sprung out of the power vacuum created by the fall of Tsarist Russia.
Led by the anarchist Nestor Makhno, the movement argued for the rights of Ukraine’s peasantry and quickly grew in popularity under the slogans “Death to those who stand in the way of free working people” and “Power breeds parasites, long live anarchy!”
At the height of the movement, self-governing communes existed across most of southern and eastern Ukraine under the protection of Makhno’s army. His base was in Huliaipole, a town in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, which has been frequently fought over since February. The Bolsheviks defeated Makhno’s army and he died in exile in Paris.
Those at the Kyiv anarchists’ headquarters admit that these are no longer “Makhno times”. Today, the anarchist movement in Ukraine is small and a battalion acting independently would collapse on a modern-day battlefield, they say.
About 100 anarchists have signed up to fight in Ukraine’s army and territorial defence forces, according to Serhiy Movchan, the group’s spokesperson. In addition, about 20 foreign anarchists have signed up, including a Russian who fled his country three years ago. Others have come to Ukraine to work as volunteer paramedics.
“We have a strict screening process,” said Dmytro, who was eager to stress that the foreign volunteers differ from some of the others who have arrived in the country since February. “We don’t want people who just come here to kill; we want them to understand what they are fighting for.”
Before the 24 February invasion, the anarchists – small in number – would join forces with wider leftwing activist networks. But attracting supporters faced obstacles due to the country’s experience of the Soviet era.
In the name of socialism, mass murders were carried out, a man-made famine was created, and swathes of culture and history, including the Ukrainian language, were repressed. A controversial set of de-Communisation laws were passed in 2015 to deal with this legacy, but many on the left feel the wider population began to associate everything on the left with the Soviet Union.
Then, under Putin’s Russia Kremlin spin doctors and their allies co-opted leftist rhetoric to create pro-Russian political parties across the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine. These parties were used to appeal to those voters who harboured nostalgia for communist times.
Leaked emails in 2016 revealed how the Kharkiv regional leader of the Communist party of Ukraine, banned the previous year for promoting separatism, had received emails from the office of the former Kremlin spin doctor Vladislav Surkov on how to foment separatism and campaign for federalisation. (Since 2014 the Kremlin has been pushing for federalisation in Ukraine as Russia’s way of re-gaining leverage in national politics.)
Dmytro also pointed to the “leftwing” messaging used by the Kremlin when creating the self-declared people’s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Russian-backed unrecognised states in eastern Ukraine. He said that the irony is that the entities have been headed by ultra-rightists such as Igor Girkin, who promoted Russian nationalism, carried out extrajudicial killings, and banned freedom of speech and association.
The recent full-scale invasion by Russia has brought another layer of mud for activists on Ukraine’s left, said Movchan.
“Putin has appropriated the word anti-fascist and he exploits it to justify his war,” said Movhcan. “[Ukrainian] nationalists say if you’re anti-fascist, you’re pro-Russian, but that’s not the case.”
Movchan said far-right nationalism has always failed to gain popular support in Ukraine, but moderate nationalism – which emphasises religion, language and the army – became mainstream after 2014.
Many Ukrainian politicians assumed nationalist messaging in an ensuing competition to present themselves as Ukrainian patriots. This nationalism promotes conservative, non-progressive ideas and therefore presents a “big problem”, said Movchan.
“I think both sides of the elite did a lot to create a situation whereby Ukrainians argue a lot about language and versions of history instead of how Kryvyi Rih Stal was privatised,” said Movchan, referring to Ukraine’s largest steelworks that was privatised in 2004 by oligarchs close to the then-president.
Movchan said that this form of nationalism has given those in power a tool to ignore Ukraine’s social issues, but that people need to be clear that Ukraine’s internal problems are not to blame for the war. “The cause of the war is the Russian Federation,” said Movchan."

Fierce battles have continued to rage in eastern Ukraine with Russian troops on the verge of encircling a key industrial city, bringing a sharp rebuke of the west from Volodymyr Zelenskiy for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war.
As the Ukrainian military reported on Thursday that 40 towns in the Donbas region were under Russian bombardment, Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday described fighting outside Sievierodonetsk, a key military goal for Russia, as “very difficult”, saying Russian troops were shelling the city from the outskirts with mortars.
“The coming week will be decisive,” Gaiday said in a video posted on Telegram, adding he believes Russia’s goal is to “capture the Luhansk region no matter what cost”.
“There is a colossal amount of shelling,” he added.
Having failed to seize Ukraine’s capital or its second city, Kharkiv, after invading in February, Russia is trying to take full control of the Donbas, comprised of two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.
Russia has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk and its twin, Lysychansk. Their fall would leave the whole of Luhansk province under Russian control, a key Kremlin war aim.
“The occupiers shelled more than 40 towns in Donetsk and Luhansk region, destroying or damaging 47 civilian sites, including 38 homes and a school. As a result of this shelling five civilians died and 12 were wounded,” the joint task force of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Facebook.
The statement said 10 enemy attacks were repelled, four tanks and four drones destroyed, and 62 “enemy soldiers” were killed.
Gaiday said police in Lysychansk were collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves. About 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added.
Families of people buried in mass graves will be able to carry out a reburial after the war, and police are issuing documents enabling Ukrainians to secure death certificates for loved ones, Gaiday said.
Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday that Russian troops “heavily outnumber us” in some parts of the east and echoed pleas from his foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba to the World Economic Forum in Davos for more weaponry from the west.
“We need the help of our partners - above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Zelenskiy said in his daily address to the nation.
And he called out the international community for paying too much attention to Russia’s interests and too little to Ukraine’s.
The Ukrainian president took specific aim at former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and the New York Times for suggesting territorial sacrifices might be necessary to end the conflict.
Kissinger, the 98-year-old champion of realpolitik, this week told World Economic Forum attendees in Davos that a return to the “status quo” before Russia’s February 24 invasion would be ideal. Russia had formally annexed Crimea in 2014, while separatist groups aligned with Moscow have long controlled the easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Pushing Moscow to surrender that territory threatened to turn the conflict into a new, broader war, Kissinger warned, adding that negotiations needed to begin within two months.
“It seems Mr Kissinger’s calendar is not 2022, but 1938,” Zelensky responded, comparing his suggestion to the agreement that ceded part of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany more than 80 years ago.
UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine, during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
“Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say, noting concessions made to Putin before operations were launched in Georgia, the Crimea and Donbas.
Russia’s invasion of its pro-western neighbour has caused global shockwaves, with the latest being fears of food shortages, particularly in Africa.
Moscow blamed the international sanctions imposed after the invasion, while the west says the shortage is mainly down to Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports.
“Solving the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the removal of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,” said Russian deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko.
But Kuleba urged delegates at Davos in Switzerland not to give in. “This is clear blackmail. You could not find a better example of blackmail in international relations,” Kuleba told the WEF in Davos. Kuleba also slammed the western military alliance Nato for “doing literally nothing” to stop Russia.
In other developments:
In a sign that the rest of the country remains at risk, Russian cruise missiles struck the major southern rail hub of Zaporizhzhia, killing one person and damaging dozens of houses, the presidency added.
President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday signed a decree simplifying a procedure to obtain a Russian passport for residents of the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson, under the full control of Russian troops, and partly-occupied Zaporizhzhia. Kyiv said the plan was a “flagrant violation” of Ukraine’s sovereignty.
The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/russian-soldier-pow-ukraine;2022-05-26;‘You shake at the smallest of noises’: Russian soldier tells of life as a PoW;"Anton, released by Ukraine in a prisoner exchange, says he is only now registering the toll captivity took on mind and body
Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm.
“It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian.
Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea.
Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory.
Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians.
Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities.
One of Anton’s family members further confirmed to the Guardian that he was captured in Ukraine and then exchanged. The Guardian was not able to verify all the details of his story.
Anton, who comes from a small, remote city in Siberia, said he signed a contract to join the military last December, shortly after graduating from vocational school.
In hindsight, he said, he should “have done everything” to avoid the army.
Anton’s unit was first transferred during the last days of December to the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, where he was told he was taking part in a “one-week” training course.
By that point, he claimed he had received practically no military training that would adequately prepare him for a full-scale war.
As weeks went by in Crimea, Anton said some members of his unit started to worry they would be sent to war, a prospect he still considered to be completely “absurd”.
“Many of the young guys couldn’t even imagine that we would go to war. They told us at the very last moment about this, the night before the invasion,” he said.
“Ultimately, it is really not fair how the Russian authorities treated me. I was sent to Ukraine completely unprepared.”
Anton’s account, which depicts a military unit that was kept in the dark about the invasion, echoes a number of other Russian soldiers who have similarly said that they did know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine. Military experts have argued that the decision to not tell a large number of its troops about the invasion is one explanation for Moscow’s halting military campaign.
On 25 February, the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Anton’s unit was ordered to cross into the country from Crimea.
He said they were driven in armoured vehicles to the outskirts of Mykolaiv, which was under heavy attack from Russian forces in the early days of the war.
As they continued on foot, part of the unit split from the main group and was ambushed by Ukrainian forces on 2 March, less than a week after entering the country. Anton said he was hit by a Ukrainian bullet while being captured, fracturing a bone in his hand.
Soon after, Ukrainian forces put a bag on his head as he was transferred to a prison cell, the location of which he said he still does not know.
At first, life in captivity was dominated by fear. “You shake at the smallest of noises. Every day you hope that this won’t be your last and you will not be killed,” Anton recalled.
He said that he was not physically assaulted during his time in captivity but alleged that Ukrainian guards would mentally torment him and other Russian soldiers.
“We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.”
Anton added that while some guards looked like “they wanted to hurt you”, the majority remained calm and “would not let their animal instinct set in”.
Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating prisoner exchanges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under the Geneva conventions, the detention of PoWs after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but as a means to prevent further participation in a conflict.
But it was the daily boredom that soon emerged as the biggest challenge, Anton said.
“If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television.
“Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity.
At one point, he was asked to record an interview about his capture with a prominent Ukrainian vlogger.
Ukrainian officials have given journalists and vloggers access to interview their Russian PoWs. Such videos have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube, but they have also faced criticism for violating the Geneva conventions.
“In such a situation, as a prisoner, you understand there isn’t really a choice to say no. You agree despite them saying that you could refuse,” Anton said.
Eventually, in early April, Anton was told that he was going to be exchanged for a Ukrainian soldier.
While Russia and Ukraine have engaged in several prisoner swaps, both countries have released almost no details on the mechanisms behind the exchanges. On 4 April, Ukraine said that it held about 600 Russian military prisoners of war. Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian PoWs in Russia.
That number has since grown significantly after at least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory when the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces last week. Ukraine has said that the Azovstal fighters would be involved in a prisoner swap, but some Russian officials have said they could be tried or even executed.
According to Anton, he was part of a one-for-one swap involving 17 other Russian soldiers, which took place near the Ukrainian city of Melitopol.
As soon as he was back in Russia, he was intensely questioned by the security services about his time in Ukraine.
“They wanted to know if they could still trust me. It was standard procedure,” he said.
But it was only days after he was discharged from a Russian hospital that he felt the full toll that his time in captivity had inflicted on his mind and body.
“During my captivity, I blocked most of my emotions. I just tried not to think about my life,” he said.
“But now, I have terrible dreams, I can barely sleep. I have gained a lot of weight,” he said.
Anton said the authorities had given him about £2,000 as compensation for his injuries. According to Russian military law, service people do not receive any special compensation for being held as a PoW, and Anton was expected to return to service once he had recovered from the injuries.
But after his experience in Ukraine, Anton is now looking for ways to quit the military for good.
“I just want to go back home, man, that is it. All I want is to go home.”"

Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine.
Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20m tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”.
Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. “Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace,” he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Oleksiy Arestovych, a presidential adviser, added: “No one is going to trade a gram of our sovereignty or a millimetre of our territory. Our children are dying, soldiers are being blown apart by shells, and they tell us to sacrifice territory. Get lost. It’s never going to happen.”
There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by Tass news agency as saying.
Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has said they cannot yet be 100% sure they have flushed every last Ukrainian fighter out of the Azovstal steel plant.
The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine”. He is reported to have said “Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation.”
Russia’s Ministry of Defence claims that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled.
Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion.
Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war.
Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit.
Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has said fighting is most intense in the Izyum region. He claimed “The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk.”
Police in Lysychansk are collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Some 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added, Reuters reports.
Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday.
Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.”
A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported.
Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria.
Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.”
Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.”
Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he believes Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. He said everyone in the world understands it is not “a special operation”, but that it is a genocide against the Ukrainian people.
German chancellor Olaf Scholz has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a thunderbolt, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms."

Moscow’s plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv has said, accusing the Kremlin of “criminal” behaviour.
“The illegal issuing of passports ... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier on Wednesday signed a decree simplifying the procedure to get a Russian passport for residents of the southern Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the initiative was further evidence of Moscow’s “criminal” war goals, namely the integration of regions held by Moscow’s army “into Russia’s legal, political and economic field”.
The official order published on Wednesday came on the heels of a 2019 decree that allowed the same fast-track procedure for residents of the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, eastern Ukraine’s breakaway regions.
Applicants are not required to have lived in Russia, do not need to provide evidence of sufficient funds or pass a Russian language test.
Kherson region is under the full control of Russian troops, while the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia is partially controlled by Moscow.
Moscow and pro-Moscow officials have said both regions could become part of Russia.
“The simplified system will allow all of us to clearly see that Russia is here not just for a long time but forever,” the Moscow-appointed deputy leader of the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency.
“We are very grateful to Russian president Vladimir Putin for all he is doing for us, for protecting Russian people in historically Russian lands that have now been liberated,” he added.
The new authorities wanted to help those wishing to “join the big family of Russia”, he said.
Applications would be processed within three months and the Kherson region had already begun work on launching centres to issue Russian passports, Stremousov said.
Several hundred thousand residents of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions have already received Russian passports.
On Monday, the authorities in Kherson introduced the rouble as the official currency alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia. On Wednesday, officials installed by Moscow announced the same measure in parts of the region of Zaporizhzhia."

The impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominated a delayed and slimmed-down World Economic Forum this year but it took George Soros to articulate what many of those making the trip to the Swiss Alps had been thinking.
Davos would not be Davos without a broadside from the 91-year-old philanthropist and former speculator, but the conflict in eastern Europe prompted his most apocalyptic warning yet.
“The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said.
Others were voicing similarly dark thoughts – some publicly, some privately. So much so, that at times it felt as if the meeting was taking place not in May 2022 but in July 1914 or August 1939, times past when the world has stood on the brink of the precipice.
The historian Adam Tooze said: “The war dominates everything. The nuclear escalation risk is not being priced in. This doesn’t feel like cold war. It’s hard to think of a time during the cold war when the US openly announced its policy was to eliminate the capacity of Russia to take independent military action.”
Similar sentiments were expressed by a senior policymaker who pointed out that a global pandemic had been unthinkable in early 2020, a near-coup in Washington incited by Donald Trump had been unthinkable in January 2021 and a war between Russia and Ukraine had been unthinkable at the start of 2022. “Why should we think the unthinkable ended with the start of the war?”
Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said the west’s military build-up in eastern Europe was designed to deter Vladimir Putin rather than provoke him, but even if Russia resists the temptation to push the nuclear button it has other ways to escalate the conflict.
Solidarity with Ukraine was total. In previous years, one of the hottest ticket at Davos was an invite to the champagne and caviar bashes thrown at the Russia House on the Promenade. This year, no Russians were invited and the party premises became the “Russia War Crimes House”, where Ukraine displayed evidence of atrocities committed since the start of the invasion.
But solidarity with Ukraine comes at a cost, as was clear from many of the sessions. It was taken as read that the war would be bad for the global economy, with the only dispute about exactly how bad. Estimates ranged all the way from a mild dose of stagflation through to Soros’s prediction of a depression.
There was no sense in Davos of the west easing its sanctions on Russia but fears over the health of the global economy reflected the fact that Putin has economic weapons at his disposal – energy and food – and has already shown a willingness to use both of them.
The Kremlin has cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, and the European Union expects to be hit by a blanket embargo this winter, assuming there is no early end to the war. Few in Davos believe peace will have broken out by the time the WEF’s annual meeting reverts to its normal mid-January slot in 2023. “We can handle it,” one European policymaker said, “but it is not going to be easy.”
Higher gas and petrol prices since the start of the war three months ago have added to inflationary pressures in many countries, prompting central banks to raise interest rates.
But for those attending Davos – and there were fewer of them than usual – it was food not energy that was the more immediate threat. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Putin was “weaponising food” by seizing Ukraine’s grain and blockading Black Sea ports.
Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund,, said: “The price of food is going up, up, up, up. We can shrink our use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day.”
Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), said developing countries were faced with a triple threat: a food crisis, a fuel crisis and a financial crisis. Sri Lanka was the first country to default on its debts since the start of the war, but the IMF fears it will not be the last to require its financial help.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. After two years dominated by the global pandemic, this was billed as the Davos where the global movers and shakers breathed a sigh of relief and planned for a sustainable recovery. The idea was to harness new technology to forge a green future in which growth would be consistent with tackling climate change.
In reality, the effects of the pandemic have lingered on, with China’s lockdowns to combat the spread of Covid-19 weakening global demand and adding to bottlenecks. Meanwhile, countries starved of Russian gas are turning to coal as a substitute.
As one climate change expert put it, countries made commitments at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.8C but had yet to turn pledges into action. As things stood, temperatures would rise by 4C.
In the longer term, the hope in Davos was that the war, and the vulnerability to Russia it has exposed, would hasten the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. The prospect of countries accelerating progress to net zero provided a rare glimpse of sunshine in what has otherwise been a sombre affair."

Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine.
Ukrainian prosecutors late on Tuesday released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria.
They say five are Russian soldiers, one is a Russian mercenary with the Wagner Group and the final two are Belarusian mercenaries.
The Guardian has previously reported on the alleged involvement of the soldiers named by prosecutors on Tuesday in the systematic torture and murder of civilians in Ukraine including the head of the village council and her husband and son.
There have been reports of Wagner fighters on the ground in Ukraine, but these are the first charges against allegedly serving mercenaries, and the first non-Russians charged.
Established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Wagner is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin and has faced western sanctions.
Russia has used paid fighters to bolster its forces since the start of the war. It was estimated to have deployed between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere, including Wagner Group fighters, in its offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region, a European official said last month.
A survivor had previously described to the Guardian how Russian soldiers who were perpetrating a sadistic killing spree lasting days in the village had described Ukraine as a “fairytale” compared with Syria.
Prosecutors said Sergey Vladimirovich Sazanov 51, born in the town of Rechitsa in Belarus, was one of about 300 Wagner mercenaries who participated in a February 2018 offensive in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. They cited the open source research group InformNapalm.
Another man, Alexander Alexandrovich Stupnitsky, 32, a native of Orsha in Belarus, was identified as a liaison officer for the assault platoon of the Wagner Group’s 1st reconnaissance and assault company.
The third man identified as a Wagner member, Sergey Sergeevich Sazonov, 33, was born in Kaliningrad and is allegedly the driver of the Wagner Group command vehicle.
Denis Korotkov, an expert on the Wagner Group, confirmed that two of the suspects had previously worked for the mercenary company. “Sazonov and Stupnitsky are in my files,” Korotkov told the Guardian. He said it was unusual for Belarusian citizens to fight with the group, because they could face jail sentences for it.
“It is likely that Sazonov and Stupnitsky fought in Syria,” he added. “They don’t have a particular reputation, just regular Wagner soldiers.”
None of the accused men are in custody, and prosecutors believe they may since have been relocated to frontline positions in the Donbas, where Putin has positioned most of his armed forces following their retreat from the area around Kyiv.
“There is a possibility that these men are still fighting in Ukraine, or that they will be killed during the fighting,”said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor in the Kyiv region. “We are still working on it and we will do everything possible to arrest them.”
Tkalenko said the investigation was based on photographic evidence, CCTV footage and reports of hundreds of survivors who confirmed the identities of their torturers.
Only three men survived the torture camp in Motyzhyn.
After killing the civilians, the soldiers buried them in mass graves around the camp. In one, investigators found the corpse of Olga Petrivna, the head of the village council of Motyzhyn, together with her husband and son. Petrivna had chosen to stay in the town and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived.
Tkalenko said that Ukrainian authorities had so far identified more than 5,000 Russian soldiers who were deployed north of Kyiv. “We are keeping records of all prisoners of war, and we know which ones committed war crimes.”
The list of alleged war criminals includes 15 other Russian soldiers charged with human rights abuses during the brutal month-long occupation of towns north of Kyiv. Anna Neistat of the Clooney Foundation for Justice said Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office had signalled that it wanted to lead the overall effort while showing a willingness to accept help from the international community.
“They are very active. To date they’ve opened 11,000 cases,” said Neistat. “For the first time in decades, in a conflict situation, we have a national prosecutor who is able to lead these investigations and it’s absolutely right” that Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines.
“Having said that, there is a danger of the prosecutors are getting overwhelmed because it’s huge number of cases,” said Neistat, who noted that instead of obstructing parallel investigations, the prosecutor’s office had been open to international support and was active in coordinating parallel investigations being launched elsewhere.There has been unprecedented interest in building cases by foreign prosecutors and NGOs over the crimes committed in Ukraine. More than a dozen national prosecutors outside of Ukraine have opened cases into war crimes or crimes of aggression. The international criminal court opened its investigation just four days after the invasion. On Monday, a court in Kyiv sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine."

Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled.
The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said delays in arrival of western arms to the frontline had left Kyiv “catastrophically short of heavy weapons”.
The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit.
Haidai added that Russian forces were attempting to “completely destroy” the city of Sievierodonetsk in an attempt to conquer the Donbas region, near Russia’s border.
“They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the Earth,” Haidai said on his Telegram channel.
“At the moment, with the support of artillery, the Russian occupiers are attacking Sievierodonetsk,” Haidai added.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation in Donbas was “extremely difficult”, with the Russian army bringing its full force to bear. Footage from recent days from frontline areas, posted on social media, has depicted a constant barrage of artillery and rocket fire raining down on key roads and Ukrainian positions.
Recent video footage posted by AFP photographer Aris Messinis in Donbas showed shells hitting close to a road in the country’s east and the constant sound of incoming artillery fire.

After failing to seize Kyiv or Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, Russia is trying to take the rest of the separatist-claimed Donbas’s two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front.
In the easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield as Russian forces have advanced from three directions to encircle them.
Assessment of Russian operations by western analysts suggests that rather than encircle Ukrainian forces in one large and all-encompassing effort, Russia is attempting to carve up Ukrainian-held territory into several small encirclements to the same effect.
The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its 24 May update that Russian troops “are instead attempting to secure smaller encirclements and focus on Sievierodonetsk”, adding that Ukrainian forces were also probably conducting a controlled withdrawal south-west of the town of Popasna to protect Ukrainian supply lines against Russian offensives.
Russia appears to have deployed higher quality troops from a so-called operational manoeuvre group to spearhead the operation around Sievierdonestsk, with some reports suggesting that Russian aircraft were flying several hundred sorties a day in support of the attack.
Russian forces also appear to be benefiting from better supply lines in the Luhansk region with Ukrainian officials appealing for more western heavy weapons – including multiple launch rocket systems – for their outgunned defenders.
In the city of Sloviansk west of Donbas, many residents took advantage of what Ukraine said was a break in the Russian assault to leave. “My house was bombed, I have nothing,” said Vera Safronova, seated in a train carriage among the evacuees.
Along with the eastern Donbas region, Moscow is also targeting southern Ukraine and has blockaded ships that would normally export Ukrainian grain and sunflower oil through the Black Sea, pushing up prices globally and threatening lives.
Russia, which has blamed Ukraine and the west for the food crisis, said it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine but said western sanctions would need to be lifted in return.
Three months into the invasion, Russia still has only limited gains to show for its worst military losses in decades, while much of Ukraine has suffered devastation as Moscow stepped up artillery strikes to compensate for its slow progress.
Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said it was deliberately advancing slowly in what it calls its “special operation” to avoid civilian casualties, comments Zelenskiy dismissed as “absolutely unreal”.
“We will continue the special military operation until all the objectives have been achieved,” Shoigu told the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russian-led military alliance of former Soviet states. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, also said Moscow’s offensive would last as long as necessary.
“We are not rushing to meet deadlines,” he said."

Prague’s central railway station seems a picture of normality amid warm spring sunshine and the return of legions of tourists, who had been largely absent at the height of Covid. On the platform one weekday morning, two German sightseers gaze curiously at the statue of Sir Nicholas Winton, the British stockbroker who helped 669 mostly Jewish children escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia on the eve of the second world war.
Yet just yards away, hundreds of Roma people are sheltering in the only place available to them since they joined the millions of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion.
Unlike other Ukrainians who have been offered refugee visas, these families have found they have nowhere to go and no one who wants them.
On the morning the Guardian visited, two small boys played unsupervised, perilously close to the platform’s edge. Nearby, a young mother lay asleep on a blanket as her infant toddler crawled over her.
The scene was symptomatic of a festering crisis that has unfolded in recent weeks, as hundreds of Roma refugees have sheltered on the station floor and in a makeshift sleeper train that berths only between 9pm and 5am, in what emergency workers say are dangerously unsanitary conditions.
More than 500 people are crammed each night into quarters that were originally envisaged to accommodate 260 on a one-night-only basis. Some have stayed for up to 10 nights.
Volunteer aid workers say they are overstretched and overwhelmed. “This is the most important situation in the Czech Republic,” says Geti Mubeenová, crisis coordinator with the Organisation for Aid to Refugees (OPU).
Along with other voluntary groups helping at the station, the OPU plans to end its work there at the end of the month in an effort to pressure the government into providing more suitable accommodation.
“We were set up to provide information, but now we are dealing with a humanitarian crisis. It is no longer sustainable,” says Mubeenová.
Out of sight of ordinary passengers in a sealed-off area of the ornate Habsburg-era station, Roma families – mostly women and children, some elderly and disabled – sit and lie around, surrounded by bags of belongings and protected by security guards, many of them also Roma.
Many are waiting for Czech authorities to decide on their status and whether they qualify for permanent accommodation; others are in an even bleaker situation.
“We tried to register for refugee protection at the registration centre but they wouldn’t accept us and didn’t give us any document explaining why,” says Zanna, a teenage mother of three children from Kyiv, who says she had arrived in Prague with her family four days earlier.
“We came here looking for a place to stay but instead we are just lying on the floor like dogs. We are exhausted and have no energy any more. I’m just feeling really hopeless.”
It is a tale typical of many Roma arrivals, aid workers say.
Since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine on 24 February, the Czech Republic has issued about 350,000 temporary protection visas to refugees.
Many Roma have faced a different fate, driven – according to Mubeenová – by an anti-Roma prejudice that is widespread in the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries. Many Roma who left Prague for Germany later returned, she says, including some who reported that police in Dresden refused to allow them to disembark from their train.
Czech officials say many Roma arrivals do not qualify for refugee status because they are EU citizens holding dual Ukrainian-Hungarian nationality – thanks to a policy enacted by Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, in 2011, of offering citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia region.
Some of the Hungarian passport holders claim they were bribed into applying for the documents, not understanding the consequences of dual citizenship. Several told the Guardian they left the Czech Republic for Budapest only to return to Prague after authorities in Hungary rejected their passports as forgeries.
Holding EU citizenship protects them from deportation under Schengen rules while affording freedom of movement between member states – but it also potentially leaves them in limbo when states are not obliged to provide accommodation under protected status arrangements.
However, Mubeenová says only a fifth of the current station inhabitants hold Hungarian citizenship. The fate of others, who often face obstacles to submitting applications or even entering registration centres, reflects hardening official attitudes that dismiss Roma arrivals as bona fide refugees.
Vít Rakušan, the Czech interior minister, has claimed that the Roma influx is tied to organised crime and spoken of the need to combat “social tourism”.
Mubeenová says: “I have sat in meetings with representatives of Prague city hall, the police etc, and noticed the narrative changing – people stopped talking about refugees and started referring to ‘economic migrants’ and ‘welfare tourists’.
“Representatives have told me that they don’t have the necessary documents to apply for protection, but they are often not even allowed to submit applications and that’s not legal.”
A spokesperson for the Czech interior ministry – which is responsible for the processing of refugees – says those at the railway station who had applied for temporary protection were entitled to state-provided accommodation, including at a recently established “tent city” in the Prague neighbourhood of Troja.
“It happens that some people refuse this offer and return to the main station. However, there are also people staying at the station who are not entitled to temporary protection or who have not applied for temporary protection at all,” he says.
“When an application for temporary protection is submitted, an assessment is made, in accordance with the legislation in force, as to whether the person concerned is eligible. If it turns out that the applicant is a citizen of another EU member state, then temporary protection cannot be granted.”
The increasingly dire situation at the station has led to instances of chickenpox, measles, hepatitis A, lice, scabies and tuberculosis being reported by medical students working as volunteers. Firefighters disinfect the premises three times a day.
Hygiene restrictions prevent aid agencies distributing hot, cooked food. In the absence of regular meals, many refugees leave during daytime and go into Prague city centre, where some resort to begging.
Jan Vágner, the station’s building manager, describes the current situation as “more challenging” than early in the refugee crisis, when more than 5,000 people poured off trains arriving from Ukraine.
“Even though the numbers are far fewer now, we need to talk to them all individually and work closely with them, but we don’t have the right kind of help,” he says.
Amid the chaos, however, one man has a relatively happy story. Stick thin and wearing a white cap, Heorhii Stan, 37, originally from Odesa, was preparing to travel to Vienna with his four children to collect his wife after successfully applying for protected status in the Czech Republic.
His relief was sharpened by having spent four nights at the railway station, an experience he described as “tough and hopeless” before being moved to an isolated refugee camp generally reserved for Roma in the Bohemian forest. “I really want to integrate here and ensure my kids go to school,” he says. “And I want to work.”

Igor Volobuyev spent two decades working in the heart of the Russian business establishment, first for Gazprom and then for its affiliate Gazprombank, where until February this year he was vice-president.
Then Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine in late February, and Volobuyev decided he could no longer stand living in Russia. He packed a small rucksack of possessions and a stack of cash, and flew out of the country on 2 March, pretending he was going on holiday.
A few days later, he crossed from Poland into Ukraine, where he spent his childhood years. Now, he spends his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service.
“I want to go to the place where I can defend my homeland with a weapon, I’m trying every day,” he said, in an interview in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. “I am never going back to Russia.”
Hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have fled the country since Putin launched the war, and many intellectuals, journalists and activists have voiced their opposition to the conflict. However, among the political and business elites, defections have been extremely rare. Despite reports of widespread dismay over the invasion of Ukraine, only a tiny handful of people have spoken publicly to condemn the war.
On Monday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war. When he resigned, Bondarev published a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster”.
Bondarev said he made his mind up to resign on the day Russia launched its invasion, but it took months to gather the resolve to go public.
Like many fellow diplomats, Bondarev had remained in his post over the past decade, despite Russia’s growing isolation due to a series of crises, including its annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.
“You understand that it is wrong,” he said in a telephone interview. “That it’s not good. But it doesn’t really touch you, your life. These bad things they happen somewhere far away. It’s not right but that’s how most people think.”
“But now this is totally different: Russia attacked another country. This is Ukraine who we always considered to be our brothers and attacked them in the most brutal manner. Bombing cities. Claiming them to be Nazis and denazified. It’s something ridiculous. It’s something unimaginable.”
Bondarev said he believed many of his fellow diplomats were also opposed to the war, but he never discussed it with them. “It isn’t something you really talked about with other people, it isn’t something you can speak about openly these days,” Bondarev said. “Everyone is silent.”
Volobuyev said that after 2014, he had started to speak openly about his concerns over Russian politics in the workplace, and while many people were scared of getting involved in a discussion, he felt that most people he knew agreed at least partially.
“In Gazprom there were a few passionate Putinists, but the majority of people understood exactly what kind of country they lived in. A lot of people in Russia are just scared,” he said.
“You have this internal censorship, that it’s dangerous to say certain things, and you live with this permanently. Ukrainians look at this and they don’t understand it because they are a free people,” he said.
Volobuyev grew up in the Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka , and left for Moscow in 1989, when he was 18. After spending some time in journalism, he joined Gazprom, where he worked for 15 years before moving to become one of Gazprombank’s vice-presidents in 2015.
As he tells it, he was originally a supporter of Putin, and voted for him in 2012, but his “eyes were opened” by the Maidan revolution in 2014 and subsequent Russia-backed war in Donbas. He wanted to return to Ukraine then, but said he could not, for family reasons, about which he declined to elaborate.
“It was a choice between my homeland and my family, and at that time I chose my family. On 24 February this year, I understood I could not put it off any longer,” he said.
Volobuyev was a mid-ranking cog in the Gazprom machine; among the higher business echelons few people have dared to break ranks.
Oleg Tinkov, a self-made billionaire who set up one of Russia’s leading banks, has so far been the most outspoken public opponent of the war among the business elite. In one of a series of critical Instagram posts, Tinkov wrote: “I don’t see ANY beneficiary of this crazy war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying.”
After his statements, Tinkov said he was forced to sell his assets at a knockdown price to an oligarch loyal to the Kremlin. In an interview with the Russian journalist Yury Dud, he said he was sure that the entire business elite backed his statements but were too scared to say the same publicly.
“I have spoken to 12 of the top 20 on the Forbes list personally, and they all support me, there is a full consensus,” he said.
He said half of those he had spoken to justified their silence by claiming to fear for their tens of thousands of employees, who could be affected if they fell out of favour with the Kremlin.
“The other half say, ‘We’ll make a statement and then lose our business, like you, and then what, what have you achieved?’”
Putin has referred to those who oppose Moscow’s actions as “scum and traitors”, whom the Russian people will “spit out like a fly”. In the current climate it is clear that public opposition to the war makes it dangerous to return to Russia.
Bondarev said he was worried about the response to his statement and said he would “welcome” an offer of asylum in the west. Tinkov has said he has hired bodyguards.
As a Russian citizen of Ukrainian origin, Volobuyev’s position is a little different. His arrival in Ukraine has given him a feeling that he has finally returned home, he said. But he accepts that he has a lot of work to do to persuade Ukrainians of his sincerity.
“All these years, I said I was Ukrainian but I continued to live and work there. I understand that I have to repent, and to prove for many years that I should be allowed to live here and that I can be trusted,” he said."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/death-to-the-enemy-ukraine-news-channels-unite-to-cover-war;2022-05-25;‘Death to the enemy’: Ukraine’s news channels unite to cover war;"State-backed broadcast has strategic and practical justifications but some see it as dangerous monopoly
In an age of social media and satellite television, the singular wartime news bulletin evokes images of families tuning in to the radio during the second world war. But in Ukraine, the state-backed broadcast has remerged, albeit with a 21st-century spin.
Shortly after Russia invaded, the country’s main TV channels started broadcasting the same content 24 hours a day, nicknamed the United News telemarathon. Each channel has a daily slot on the broadcast, which is shown simultaneously on all the channels.
United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels. It has since been signed into law and now includes all Ukrainian channels that used to show news.
The head of Ukraine’s parliamentary broadcasting committee said he believed the arrangement should continue until the war ends.
While some say there are critical strategic justifications for the telemarathon, others argue that it amounts to a monopoly of the information space by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and could be exploited for political purposes.
“The telemarathon is the information war equivalent of our anti-aircraft systems and I think it’s the most optimal option for Ukraine right now,” said Svitlana Ostapa, the deputy head of Detector Media, a media monitoring organisation that tracks propaganda, disinformation and political interference in Ukraine. “It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population.
In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that experts said worked to destabilise the country.
There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together. “Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,” Ostapa said. “The top ministers and officials do not have the time to comment to more than half a dozen channels, and this format means they are communicating with the population once a day and not being seen to favour one channel.”
The language used by Ukraine’s TV presenters has changed dramatically, reflecting usage among the wider population. Russian soldiers are often called “occupiers”, “terrorists”, “orcs” and “Rashists” – a combination of the words Russian and fascist.
Guests are welcomed with the greeting “Glory to Ukraine!”, to which they answer “Glory to the heroes!”. The famous words of a Ukrainian soldier tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, who was recorded over the military radio saying “Russian ship go fuck yourself”, are mentioned without the swearword being censored, and the presenters regularly end their segments with “Death to the enemy!”, a historic Ukrainian wartime slogan.
The 24-hour wartime news focuses on the Ukrainian military’s victories, its defence of Ukraine’s frontlines and Russia’s war crimes. The abrupt collapse of Ukraine’s economy in February means there is almost no advertising. Commercial breaks advertise hotlines for finding missing loved ones and reporting war crimes, as well as videos produced by normal Ukrainians, the Ukrainian army press service and the presidential office about the resistance of Ukrainian soldiers and citizens.
Ostapa said the language and messaging were discussed in editorial meetings between all the channels involved, the culture ministry and the national broadcasting council, and there was now a move to ban slogans containing swearwords. The overarching editorial message of the telemarathon is Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russian brutality, Ostapa wrote in one her analysis pieces.
The TV channel heads have rejected accusations that the authorities dictate the content, saying dialogue with officials includes things such as censoring information that reveals Ukrainian military positions. And since May, Ukrainians looking for an alternative to news can tune in to other channels that show films and cartoons about good winning out against evil.
But some see the unified TV coverage as propagandistic and point to the fact that airtime is now almost exclusively given to people close to the president, including regular comedy sketches by the president’s former comic colleagues.
“The telemarathon is an attempt by the presidential office to gain even greater control over the information space,” said Aksenyia Kurina, a journalist and campaigner who has spent her career focusing on censorship in Ukraine. “We may soon find ourselves in a heavily censored information space.”
Zelenskiy won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election with more than 70% of the vote, thanks in large part, said Kurina, to his innovative digital campaign. Zelenskiy’s party also controls Ukraine’s parliament.
Though Ukraine’s media have celebrated a marked change in their president since the invasion, Zelenskiy was on terse terms with some journalists before the war. He was known to publicly display disdain towards journalists who asked critical questions, and his press service ostracised some reporters for critical coverage.
“The telemarathon does not reflect reality, it forms a picture that the authorities would like to see. This is dangerous, because at some point the authorities may begin to believe in their own propaganda,” said Kurina. “I understand that many journalists are not able to cope with their emotions at the moment, for many this is a personal traumatic experience, but it is important to remember professional ethics and not to allow hate speech.”
Notably, three channels owned by Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko and that are close to his associates have not been given slots and therefore do not contribute to the telemarathon’s content or editorial meetings. Poroshenko was charged with treason after Zelenskiy came to power, a case that the former president says is politically motivated.
At first, Poroshenko’s channels split their coverage 50-50 between the telemarathon and their own content. But since in mid-March all channels – except for those dedicated to light entertainment – are obliged to stream the telemarathon.
The head of one of Poroshenko’s channels has said that despite their appeals to be included, they are still waiting to hear from the authorities."

Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, he added. “The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now.”
Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building.
The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.”
The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building.
Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation.
Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers found in formerly occupied towns in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war or for Ukrainian bodies. In Kharkiv, 60 bodies were retrieved and stacked in a refrigerated rail carriage, Reuters reports.
Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park which was hit by about 50 shells in three months of war. “Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crimes. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko said.
A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that only 10% of respondents found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace.
Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. Turkey’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting.
A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies.
Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. Soros added that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression."

Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners.
Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov battalion, was able to briefly call his wife, Kateryna, who said she had also been told that the prisoners had not been subjected to violence. It was not immediately clear if Prokopenko had been able to speak freely during the conversation.
“He said he was ‘OK’ and asked how I was,” Kateryna Prokopenko told the Guardian on Tuesday. “I’ve heard from other sources that the conditions are more or less satisfactory.”
At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces.
The Azov battalion has played a central role in Russia’s justification for its invasion, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. Officials in Kyiv have suggested they could be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials have called for them to face trial or even execution on “terrorism” charges.
Previously, the only news of the fighters’ conditions had come via a news channel given access to the prison by the Russian Ministry of Defence. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is involved in monitoring the conditions for prisoners of war and has a long-held policy of not publicly commenting, has not issued a statement.
“They are being fed, given water. The conditions meet the requirements and they have not been subjected to violence during this short period,” said Kateryna Prokopenko. “What will happen next, of course, we don’t know but at the moment there are third parties – the UN and the Red Cross – who are controlling the situation.”
Most of the injured Azov fighters are being held in a prison in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk, but a smaller group of severely injured fighters are in a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Prokopenko said that to her knowledge none of the fighters have been taken to Russia.
Russia’s propaganda narrative of the war has long played up the influence of the battalion, claiming that its members are neo-Nazis.
Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. Since then, it has been integrated in the Ukrainian army and Azov commanders say its fighters hold a range of political opinions.
Kateryna Prokopenko has launched an independent organisation to campaign for the Azovstal fighters who also include Ukrainian border guards and members of the Ukrainian security services.
“The aim of the organization is to organise weekly calls with those being held prisoners, to debunk Russian fakes about our guys, to ensure that their conditions remain satisfactory – a bed, medicine, water and food, and to campaign for their swift release,” said Kateryna."

Fished out of the water, smashed asunder, is a Ukrainian TB2 drone, retrieved in the last couple of days off the coast of Romania and almost certainly a legacy of a bold attempt to retake Snake Island earlier in the month.
The previously inconsequential low-lying 17-hectare (42-acre) rock, nearly 30 miles from the coasts of Ukraine and Romania, has become of growing strategic importance as Russia seeks to maintain its blockade of Ukraine’s remaining coastline.
For all the videos of TB2 drones destroying Russian air defence systems, helicopters and landing craft this month, Ukraine has failed in its attempt to retake the island, memorably lost in the first days of the war when its garrison told the attacking Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”.
Over the weekend a Togolese-flagged vessel passing near Snake Island was warned by the Russians to “leave the territorial waters of Russia, otherwise weapons will be used”, according to the Ukrainian navy. It amounted to “illegally appropriating Ukrainian territory”, the navy added.
Russia’s navy has dominated the Black Sea since the war began, not least because Ukraine had no real maritime force to speak of. It had lost three-quarters or more of its navy during Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its only remaining frigate was deliberately scuttled days after the war started to prevent its capture.
However, Russia lost its flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, in the middle of April to a Neptune cruise missile strike from Ukraine’s mainland. The ship had provided air and sea defence capability to the remainder of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, consisting of 20 or more warships and submarines.
The Moskva had helped capture Snake Island, and without it the Russian fleet was pushed back further from Ukraine’s coast (Neptune missiles have a range of up to 200 miles), bringing the island back into play. Russia’s determination to hang on to the rock shows it is, in effect, an alternative to the sunken ship.
“Think of it as an unsinkable destroyer,” said Andy Netherwood, an air defence expert. “If you place a radar and surface-to-air missile systems there, it allows you to dominate the airspace in the northern Black Sea, including the strategically important approach to Odesa.”
Russia has used its dominance of the Black Sea to launch Kalibr cruise missile attacks on Ukrainian targets, including from submarines. The missiles can have a range of 1,200 miles, able in theory to strike virtually anywhere in Ukraine.
But if anything it is the economic aspect that has come to the fore. “In a conflict of attrition and erosion, the ability to maintain an economic blockade can become significant. World war one comes to mind,” said Dr Sidharth Kaushal, a naval power expert with the Rusi thinktank, referring to the long British naval blockade of Germany that is widely believed to have helped bring about the Central powers’ eventual collapse towards the end of 1918.
Ukraine, however, is a net exporter of food, particularly grain and sunflower oil. It previously moved 70% of its exports by sea, including 99% of its grain deliveries to countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Yemen. Although some grain is now moving by land, it will not be enough.
Discussions have turned to the idea of creating a protective naval convoy for merchant shipping bound for Ukraine, as proposed by Lithuania this week. But while the UK and others are sympathetic, it would require broad international support, including, Royal Navy sources suggested on Tuesday, from China.
It would also require the involvement of Turkey, which closed the straits to all warships – except those returning to their home port – at the end of February, a situation welcomed by Ukraine at the time because it prevented more Russian warships from entering the Black Sea.
Opening the straits would allow limited access for Nato warships, for up to 21 days at a time under the 1936 Montreux convention, but also for Russia – meaning any convoy solution may have to be agreed with Moscow. It would also require a de-mining of the Ukrainian coast, somewhat hastily defended when the war broke out.
Amid such complications, attention remains focused on military solutions. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said on Monday that Denmark would send to Ukraine a Harpoon cruise missile system, with a similar operational range to the Neptune – the first declared deployment of such a naval system.
That will help keep the Russian warships away from Ukraine’s coast, although Moscow’s Kilo-class submarines remain able to roam far more freely. Despite the attempts to take back Snake Island and the growing international calls to reopen the Black Sea, Russia’s grip on the strategic body of water remains firm.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/pete-buttigieg-says-us-backs-new-marshall-plan-to-rebuild-ukraine;2022-05-24;Pete Buttigieg calls for new Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine;"Exclusive: Transportation secretary says there is global support for reconstruction effort to help recovery from Russian invasion
A leading figure in the Biden administration has backed a recovery programme for Ukraine in the style of the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war.
Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said there was plenty of political will at home and internationally towards cooperating in long-term reconstruction efforts including to buttress existing infrastructure in Ukraine.
“With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” the former presidential candidate said in an interview with the Guardian.
Buttigieg admitted that while “the destruction of Ukrainian homes and infrastructure is still under way”, to talk about reconstruction might feel premature “and yet in my encounters with Ukrainian leaders, and particularly my counterpart [Oleksandr Kubrakov], who I speak to regularly, they are already thinking about reconstruction even as they’re thinking about defending their homeland and it’s inspiring to see and it deserves strong and unified support from us.”
He said a “major topic of conversation” among transport ministers at the world meeting in Leipzig this week for the International Transport Forum was how they could help to get grain and other produce out of Ukraine, which is stuck because of blocked and destroyed ports and railway lines and is threatening to create a global food shortage.
“This is not only something that concerns us, as friends to Ukraine, but also concerns us because the world needs that production, especially on the agricultural side,” he said.
“Without access to the Black Sea, it’s always going to be a major disadvantage. We’re committed to helping there in any way we can.
“But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west.
“But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.”
Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war.
The plan was named after George Marshall, the man who was then US secretary of state.
Buttigieg, who is in charge of implementing and overseeing a large swathe of projects in the US enabled under the $1tn (£800bn) infrastructure bill that passed six months ago, stressed the relevance to the US as well as Ukraine of Marshall’s insistence about the need to create a “virtuous circle” between the economic security of a nation and its political stability based on its capacity to deliver.
He said that decades of disinvestment in the US had turned the virtuous cycle into a vicious one, with political institutions that lacked the resources to deliver well losing their legitimacy, leading to an erosion of trust, “which has given credence to those who would undermine those institutions, further diminishing their capacity to deliver”, he said.
The infrastructure fund was intended to break that cycle, he added. “If we can deliver as we’re setting out to do … then citizens will see what it means for them. We’ve got all kinds of things that have scrambled up our political and social life right now, including the information environment, the forms of extremism … and shocks like the pandemic, and economic reverberations from the war in Europe. It’s all the more reason for us to focus on delivering for people.”
He said that the stakes included not just comfort and convenience, but “perhaps also the credibility of governance itself”.
“In the 1930s, another season when democracy was in doubt, and when it had become fashionable in some circles in Washington to point approvingly to the rise in dictators, some would say by way of praise for fascism that Mussolini makes the trains run on time.
“This turns out to not be particularly true, by the way … but how revealing it is that this excuse for autocrats comes on the basis of their supposed prowess in providing transportation.”
Regarding Ukraine, Buttigieg said he was interested in President Volodymr Zelenskiy’s calls for reconstruction on a cities and regional level, under a plan apparently gaining traction, by which cities and communities across the world would adopt similar communities in Ukraine to their own ones.
“Understanding the needs and different capacities of different parts of the country is going to be very important,” Buttigieg said.
Asked if his government’s legitimacy over helping to rebuild a country was to be trusted after its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Buttigieg, who served in the country as an officer in the US Navy Reserve, said:
“Part of what we were up against in Afghanistan is just how fundamentally different the society, the values, the governance culture and the economics of that country are … it’s very different in Ukraine … one of the things that unites us to Ukraine are some of those core values around democracy.
“It’s so early to know what will be at the end of this upheaval. What we know is that the kind of united approach we have that reflects shared values among our partners and with Ukrainians is a very powerful one and will be an important basis of the relationship.
“Not just in getting us through this war, whatever the endgame looks like, but in a reconstruction that really does hold the promise of leading to new and innovative things.”
He praised the leadership he said Germany had shown since the start of the invasion, contrasting with the criticism the government of Olaf Scholz has received.
“I think it’s understood in Washington that the new steps that Germany has taken are major steps in security and energy policy … none of us knows what lies on the other side of this Zeitenwende,” he said, adopting the phrase used by Scholz meaning “turning point”, “but all of us should recognise that the only way for it to lead to a good place is for us to find our way to it together.”
Earlier on Thursday, Buttigieg took a tour of Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof or central station, a symbol of German unification, and met a group of Germans and US citizens of Ukrainian origin working as volunteers to receive refugees, about 2,000 of whom are arriving on trains from Ukraine each day.
“Just make sure you help us by keeping the narrative alive back home,” one of the volunteers, Natalia, from Minnesota and of Ukrainian descent, told him as Buttigieg thanked the women for their work.
Buttigieg, who ran for the US presidency in 2020 but withdrew in favour of supporting Joe Biden, would not be drawn on whether he had plans to run again in 2024.
“Right now my ambitions are to be the best secretary of transportation that I can,” he said. “I think there’s never been a better time to have this job.”

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/ukraine-invasion-may-be-start-of-third-world-war-says-george-soros;2022-05-24;Ukraine invasion may be start of ‘third world war’, says George Soros;"Veteran philanthropist tells World Economic Forum civilisation ‘may not survive’ what is coming
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned.
In a ferocious attack on Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Soros warned that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression.
Soros, who has become a hate figure for the hard right in the US, also heavily criticised the former German chancellor Angela Merkel for cosying up to Moscow and Beijing.
With the mood in Davos already downbeat due to the war in Ukraine, Soros ramped up the gloomy rhetoric to new heights.
“The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said.
“The invasion of Ukraine didn’t come out of the blue. The world has been increasingly engaged in a struggle between two systems of governance that are diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society.”
The 91-year-old former hedge fund owner said the tide had started to turn against open societies in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001. “Repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege. Today China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society.”
Soros, who led the speculative financial attack that drove the pound out of the European exchange rate mechanism 30 years ago, said Europe had responded well to the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion.
“It will take a long time to work out the details, but Europe seems to be moving in the right direction. It has responded to the invasion of Ukraine with greater speed, unity and vigour than ever before in its history.”
He added: “But Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels remains excessive, due largely to the mercantilist policies pursued by former chancellor Angela Merkel. She had made special deals with Russia for the supply of gas and made China Germany’s largest export market. That made Germany the best performing economy in Europe but now there is a heavy price to pay. Germany’s economy needs to be reoriented. And that will take a long time.”
Soros said Putin had won Xi’s agreement to the Russian invasion at the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in early February. But he insisted the Chinese leader was not as strong as he believed.
“Xi harbours a guilty secret. He never told the Chinese people that they had been inoculated with a vaccine that was designed for the original Wuhan variant and offers very little protection against new variants.”
Soros said Xi was unable to “come clean” because he was at a delicate moment in his career. “His second term in office expires in the fall of 2022 and he wants to be appointed to an unprecedented third term, eventually making him ruler for life.”
China’s lockdowns to combat Covid-19 had pushed the economy into freefall but Xi was unable to admit he had made a mistake, he said.
“Coming on top of the real estate crisis the damage will be so great that it will affect the global economy. With the disruption of supply chains, global inflation is liable to turn into global depression.”
Contrary to general expectations, Xi may not get his coveted third term because of the mistakes he had made, Soros predicted.
“While the war rages, the fight against climate change has to take second place. Yet the experts tell us that we have already fallen far behind, and climate change is on the verge of becoming irreversible. That could be the end of our civilisation.
“Therefore, we must mobilise all our resources to bring the war to an early end. The best and perhaps only way to preserve our civilisation is to defeat Putin as soon as possible. That’s the bottom line.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/24/alexander-lebedev-quits-independent-role-after-canada-sanctions;2022-05-24;Alexander Lebedev severs links with Independent after Canada sanctions;"Russian oligarch, who bought British news outlet for £1 in 2010, ‘directly enabled’ Putin’s war, says Canada
The Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev has quit his role at a company connected to the Independent, shortly after being placed under economic sanctions by Canada for “directly enabling” the Russian war in Ukraine.
It means the former KGB agent now has no formal link to the British news outlet. His departure may have had the effect of protecting the Independent from any issues that might have arisen out of the sanctions.
Canada last week named Lebedev on a list of 14 prominent people who had “directly enabled Vladimir Putin’s senseless war in Ukraine and bear responsibility for the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine”. Canadian individuals and businesses are now banned from conducting business with him and connected entities.
The 62-year-old Russian bought the Independent for £1 in 2010, having previously taken control of London’s Evening Standard for the same sum the previous year. He later transferred control of the publications to his son Evgeny – a friend of Boris Johnson who was recently given a seat in the House of Lords by the prime minister, despite concerns from the security services. The two news outlets have since racked up huge losses, while giving the Lebedevs a degree of influence in British society, although the Independent has returned a profit in recent years.
Corporate filings show Alexander Lebedev stepped down as a director of Independent Print Ltd on Sunday, the day after it was publicly reported that he was on the Canadian sanctions list. The company, which published the print edition of the Independent until 2016, is owned by Evgeny, who is also an owner of the Independent and Evening Standard.
A spokesperson for the newspapers played down the importance of the elder Lebedev’s resignation from the IPL board of directors, saying he had not been actively involved in the news outlets since 2016. They said: “Alexander Lebedev has no role, commercial or otherwise, in the running of either the Independent or the Evening Standard.”
Alexander Lebedev rose to prominence as a banker in the 1990s in Russia before funding the opposition Novaya Gazeta outlet. His wife, Elena Perminova, 35, has continued to post updates on her widely followed Instagram account about fashion launches, with recent pictures showing the family on a holiday in Istanbul.
The decision to put Alexander Lebedev on the sanctions list has renewed scrutiny of the prime minister’s decision to award a peerage to his 42-year-old son. The government has so far failed to comply with a House of Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, arguing this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated to the upper house of parliament and could degenerate into “political point-scoring”.
The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Ellis, told parliament he did not believe it was in the public interest to release the correspondence relating to the decision, adding: “Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.”
The ownership of the Independent and Evening Standard has long been a source of intrigue. Since taking control of the outlets from his father, Evgeny Lebedev has sold minority stakes in them to a bank with close connections to the Saudi Arabian state.
This article was amended on 27 May 2022. An earlier version implied that Alexander Lebedev quit a “role” connected to the current publisher of the Independent newspaper, Independent Digital News and Media Limited. In fact, Alexander Lebedev resigned as a director of Independent Print Limited, which had been the publisher of the print edition of the newspaper until 2016. Text was also added to reflect that the Independent has returned a profit in recent years."

The governor of Luhansk has delivered a warning that it is too late for thousands of civilians to be evacuated from the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk, as it faced an intensive Russian assault to take the city and the parts of the province still held by Ukraine.
Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces who have been attempting to complete their encirclement of the pocket around the city, Sievierodonetsk and the towns and villages to its west have been under intense bombardment in recent days.
Fifteen thousand residents were still believed to be in the city hiding in shelters from what Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described as “the largest [offensive] on European soil since the second world war” while a defence ministry spokesman said the war was currently in its “most active phase.”
Russian forces have been attempting to cut Ukrainian supply lines to Sievierodonestsk by trying to control key roads to the west.
“At this point I will not say: get out, evacuate. Now I will say: stay in a shelter,” Sergiy Haidai said on his Telegram channel. “Because such a density of shelling will not allow us to calmly gather people and come for them.”
“The enemy has focused efforts on the offensive operation to encircle Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Now, with the support of artillery, they are conducting assault operations in the direction of Toshkivka and Ustynivka, near Lysychansk,” Haidai wrote.
Ukraine’s defence ministry reported on Monday that Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukrainian defences around Popasna in an attempt to push west toward Bakhmut, a crucial junction that serves as a command centre for much of the Ukrainian war effort.
“I looked up from my prayers and heard a frightening sound,” said 82-year-old Maria Mayashlapak a resident of Bakhmut which has seen repeated airstrikes. “Every day I pray to God asking to avoid injuries. God heard me. God is watching over me.”
According to the latest intelligence update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence, capturing Sievierodonetsk would put the whole of Luhannsk region under Russian control, an ambition flagged up by Russia last week.
In a further development, the defence correspondent of the Kyiv Independent tweeted late on Tuesday that Ukrainian defenders appeared to have ceded two towns outside the city Horlivka – south of Sievierodonetsk– under “extreme Russian pressure” to retreat to more defensible positions.
NEW COPY That appeared to be confirmed by Serhiy Hoshko, the head of the Svitlodarsk military administration who said Russian forces entered the town and hoisted a Russian flag on the city council building. END NEW COPY
It looks like the Ukrainian military has decided to cede the towns of Myronivsky and Svitlodarsk and retreat northwest to more reliable defense lines due to extreme Russian pressure in the Popasna-Bakhmut-Severodonetsk area.

The Donbas, which includes all of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, is Ukraine’s old industrial heartland running from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. Predominantly Russian-speaking, almost a third of the area was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014.
During his Monday night address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, underlined the violence of the fighting around Sievierodonetsk. “The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said, singling out the worst-hit towns of Bakhmut, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk.
“The Russian military is trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the captured areas of the Kharkiv region, they will not give up the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhya region and Donbas.
“In some places they are advancing, where they are pulling up reserves, where they are trying to strengthen their positions. In the coming weeks, the wars will be difficult, and we must be aware of this.”
Despite the stepped-up Russian efforts in the Donbas, and huge levels of destruction, some western officials pointed to the difficulties being faced by the Kremlin’s forces amid emerging criticism of the conduct of the campaign by Russian military bloggers.
“The Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalised effort in the eastern part of the country,” the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said on Friday, describing the Donbas fighting as very dynamic, with small towns and villages changing hands daily.
The lack of resources was underlined last week by an abrupt Russian withdrawal from areas near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city which has been bombarded since the start of the war. Some of those forces apparently were redeployed to the Donbas, but it was not enough to tip the scales on the battlefield.
“They really had to thin out the troops they had around Kharkiv, simply because they’re trying to hold to too much of a line with too few troops,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.
Away from Sievierodonetsk, there was also evidence that Russian forces were working to strengthen their tactical position around Kharkiv, having moved some troops from around the city to redeploy units to the fighting further south.
The latest fighting came as the bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official.
Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building.

The son of a Russian billionaire facing sanctions for supporting the dictator who runs Belarus has been linked to a £160m portfolio of London properties.
Said Gutseriev, a 34-year-old businessman with British and Russian nationality, appears to have spent years amassing a collection of at least seven properties in central London.
They range from large office buildings in the City to a pair of £17m townhouses in south Kensington knocked together to make one residence.
Said’s father, Mikhail Gutseriev, was blacklisted last year, by the EU in June and the UK in August, months after the violent repression of protests which threatened to bring to an end 26 years of autocratic rule by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. The UK government described Gutseriev as “a longstanding associate” of the president, who had used his business interests to support Lukashenko’s government.
The property collection emerged from the findings of a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Belarusian Investigative Center, part of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.
All of the properties examined were bought before Mikhail was sanctioned. Six were acquired between 2004 and 2012, when Said was either at school or university, or was just starting his career at the FTSE 100 commodities trader Glencore. Said attended £14,500 a term Harrow school before studying at Oxford.
Leaked documents suggest Said was given a head start thanks to his family’s wealth. One of the properties appears to ultimately belong to a trust established by his father in 2007. Said was listed as a beneficiary of the trust in official paperwork from 2008 and 2009 seen by the Guardian. The paperwork also names him as a beneficiary of a second trust, established in 2004 by his grandmother, Marem Gutserieva. Said controls a stake in Russneft, the Russian oil company that was part-owned by his father until the latter transferred his holding to his brother in August 2021.
A spokesperson for Said Gutseriev said he has no financial or commercial links to his father, and always acts in accordance with applicable law, including on sanctions. The spokesperson did not dispute Said’s ownership of any of the properties.
The information about assets linked to him in the UK raises questions about whether sanctions should apply to family members.
Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the thinktank Rusi, said: “One of the challenges that western countries will now be having is identifying the true extent of assets that should be frozen under sanctions regimes. It’s reasonable to look closely at assets owned by family members – not just asset purchases in recent years but transfers in the past.”
The properties that appear to be linked to Said were uncovered in analysis by Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, using data from the Land Registry, UK Companies House and offshore leaks obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Most were bought using companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven which allows company owners to remain hidden.
They include:
A £19m office block called the Gloucester Building on Avonmore Road.
Austin Friars House, London, a £41m office building at the centre of the City of London.
82-85 Fleet Street, London, a £70m office building in the City of London.
64-65 Vincent Square, London, an £8.7m office block near Victoria railway station.
A pair of £17m Grade II-listed stucco-fronted townhouses remodelled to create a single residence on Queen’s Gate Place, just south of Hyde Park.
A £2.5m mews house in Petersham Mews, Kensington.
A £5.7m townhouse on Green Street in Mayfair.
The Queen’s Gate Place home, a listed building near London’s Natural History Museum, has been used by Said as his main London residence. It underwent extensive renovations in 2013, with planning documents showing ornate, gold-painted walls, elaborately carved cornices, classically painted murals and chandeliers.
Another property, Lilly House at 13 Hanover Square in London, was sold for £69m in November last year.
Said’s net worth is estimated at $1.3bn (£1bn) by Forbes, a valuation the magazine said was based on stakes in oil, coal, retail and financial businesses, some of which were previously owned by his father.
Said is the major shareholder of SFI, a Russian company formerly called Safmar Financial Investments in which Mikhail was previously a “controlling shareholder”, according to its annual reports. Mikhail served alongside his son on SFI’s board until November 2021. SFI owns a stake in Russneft and in the online retailer M.Video, a business originally bought by the father.
In the last year, Said is understood to have severed some financial ties with companies previously linked to his father and with Russia and Belarus. He reportedly resigned in August 2021 as the head of ForteInvest, an oil refinery company where he had been made chief executive in 2014 at the age of 26. A company press release said Forteinvest was owned by his father’s Safmar Group as recently as late 2020. In August 2021, he sold his stake in the Belarus-based cryptocurrency exchange Currency.com, according to local media.
Ben Cowdock, the investigations lead for Transparency International UK, said: “Following the money is critical to making financial sanctions bite. Those who are targeted by sanctions may have shared their wealth among family, friends and associates.”
Said studied archaeology and anthropology at St Peter’s College, Oxford, and in 2019 the university created a Gutseriev fellowship after he donated £2.6m. When he married in 2016, Sting, Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias performed at the opulent celebrations, which took place in London and Moscow.
Gutseriev’s spokesperson said: “Mr Said Gutseriev does not have any financial or commercial links to Mr Mikhail Gutseriev and cannot be termed a business partner of his father’s. To suggest otherwise is factually incorrect. Mr Said Gutseriev is a British national and resident, he understands fully the scope and application of sanctions targeting his father, and always acts in accordance with applicable law.
“Any suggestion that he holds any funds or assets for, or makes funds or assets available to, his father is factually incorrect. He has no financial or business links to any sanctioned individuals or entities and acts in full compliance with UK sanctions. To suggest otherwise is factually incorrect.
“Mr Said Gutseriev is not a political figure and has no personal or financial links to the Russian or Belarussian governments.
“He urges a peaceful resolution to the fighting in Ukraine and condemns the alleged human rights abuses. Any instances of human rights abuses should be tried according to international law and anyone found guilty punished with the full force of the law.”
Mikhail Gutseriev did not respond to requests for comment."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/ukrainian-farmers-war-food-insecurity-famine;2022-05-24;‘My house, the barns, I lost everything’: the Ukrainian farmers devastated by war;"Hundreds of farms were destroyed in a war that has worsened food insecurity and threatened famine
There was a gruelling artillery duel between Ukrainian and Russian troops, positioned just four kilometres apart. Right in the middle, between the two frontlines, stood Ivan Mishchenko’s farmhouse, with his dozens of cows and 100 hectares (247 acres) of wheat fields, transformed into a bloody battleground for five consecutive days in early March.
“Two kilometres on the right were the Russian troops, two kilometres on the left were our troops,” said Mishchenko, 66, whose farm lies in the countryside around Pochepyn, a small village north of Kyiv.
“They were shooting so hard, as if it was some kind of computer game. The first two days I stayed in the house, but then it was so insufferable that I had to leave. When I returned, I was in shock. My house, the warehouse, the barns ... were all destroyed. I lost everything.”
Mishchenko, who has livestock and grain fields, is one of hundreds of Ukrainian farmers whose businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, his few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling.
Silos and ports across Ukraine are brimming with more than 20 million metric tonnes of grain and corn that has nowhere to go, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast and the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain.
Ukraine used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia invaded the country, it has been forced to export by train or via its small Danube River ports. As a result, global wheat prices leaped by 20% in March, owing to the direct impact of the war on wheat production, with the world facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition, at a time when 42 million people were already one step away from famine.
David Beasley, the executive director of the UN World Food Programme, which feeds 125 million people and buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, appealed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin: “If you have any heart at all, please open these ports.”
“This is not just about Ukraine,” Beasley said last week. “This is about the poorest of the poor who are on the brink of starvation as we speak.”
“The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” says Mishchenko. “We already have problems, because even those farmers who managed to sow their fields, they simply don’t have enough fuel to harvest. Another problem – fertilisers; we used to import them from Russia and Belarus, not enough fertiliser means you harvest 20-30% less.”
Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine served as one of the world’s leading breadbaskets – exporting roughly 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports, including 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn, and half of its sunflower oil.
Last year, Ukraine produced about 33m tonnes of wheat, of which it exported about 20m tonnes, making it the sixth largest exporter globally. This year, with the situation as it stands, according to the satellite analysis company Kayrros, which uses artificial intelligence combined with data from satellites to monitor commodities, the wheat harvest in the country is likely to be down by at least 35% compared with 2021.
“I don’t know how to survive,” says Mishchenko, who toured the world before the war with a Ukrainian folk choir. “The government doesn’t have the money to help us rebuild. All the money goes to the army.”
The cannon shots of both Russian and Ukrainian artillery destroyed his warehouse, the shed where he worked the grain and the house where he lived with his wife and son, Roman, 42. At least 20 of his cows were shot, the carcasses still lying inside the stables, which were also destroyed. The livestock that survived the bombings have been reduced to skin and bones after a blast incinerated tons of hay.
The war not only destroyed Mishchenko’s business. It also took his son-in-law away from him.
“He volunteered to join the army and was killed defending Marakiv.”
Like many other Ukrainian farmers, Mishchenko will have to start rebuilding everything from scratch. A few days ago, he launched a crowdfunder, and is hoping to resume his business as soon as possible.
Mishchenko was one of the first independent growers in Ukraine, after the fall of the Soviet Union. When he bought this piece of land with his wife, back in the early 1990s, all they had was a tiny trailer.
Today, the trailer is the only structure left standing after shelling, and that’s where Mishchenko and his son live today.
“Thirty years after I built all this, I am back in that trailer,” he said. “All my life – everything I have built with my own hands in these 30 years, was destroyed, in just one moment.”

At about midnight on 1 March 2022, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era explosives over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv. They were powerful FAB-250 bombs, designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. There were no such structures, however, in this quiet town of 13,000 people.
The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, leaving in their path a gigantic crime scene that Ukrainian prosecutors investigating alleged war crimes by Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, have been working on for weeks.
A war crime is a violation of the laws of war, a component of international law established by the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 and further defined by the Geneva conventions of 1949, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war and civilians, torture and the use of illegal weapons. The Guardian has visited the small towns and villages north of Kyiv razed to the ground during the Russian occupation and reviewed evidence found there – as well as other materials from Ukrainian prosecutors – of imprecise munitions such as the FAB-250, metal dart shells and cluster bombs whose use led to the deaths of hundreds of civilians.
The FAB-250s are among the bombs most used by the Russians against Ukrainian towns in the Kyiv oblast, such as Bucha, Hostomel and Borodyanka. According to investigators, at least eight buildings in the towns north of Kyiv were destroyed by these powerful, unguided bombs, causing hundreds of deaths. The FAB-250 is a very inaccurate, airdropped bomb, largely employed by the former Soviet Union in its war in Afghanistan and by Russia in Syria.
The tactics appear to have come directly from the civil war in Syria, which Moscow joined in 2015 to support the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The buildings destroyed in Borodyanka by the FAB-250s exhibit levels of destruction very similar to the razed buildings in Aleppo.
The FAB-250s freefall from bombers and, in their design at least, are intended for use against surface military fortification. Although Russia says it is trying to destroy military targets, evidence collected or reviewed by the Guardian during visits to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodyanka, and independently verified by weapons experts, shows these bombs were dropped on residential buildings and civilian infrastructure.
Pathologists and coroners carrying out postmortems on bodies found in mass graves in the region north of Kyiv have found tiny metal arrows embedded in people’s heads and chests. Independent weapons experts who reviewed pictures of the metal arrows found in the bodies have confirmed that they were fléchettes, an anti-personnel weapon widely used during the first world war.
These small metal darts are contained in field gun shells of a type fired by Russian artillery in the towns of Bucha and Irpin. Each shell can contain up to 8,000 fléchettes. Once fired, the shells burst when a timed fuse detonates and explodes above the ground. The fléchette darts, typically 3-4cm in length, disperse in a wide conical arch spanning 300 metres by 100 metres.
On impact with a victim’s body, the dart loses rigidity and bends into a hook, while the arrow’s rear, made of four fins, often breaks away and causes a second wound. The munitions are not prohibited under international law, despite human rights groups long seeking a ban on fléchette shells. However, the use of imprecise lethal weapons in densely populated civilian areas is a violation of humanitarian law.

Fléchettes were dropped during the first world war from the then novel aeroplanes to attack infantry and pierce their helmets. They were not widely used during the second world war, but re-emerged in the Vietnam war when the US employed a version of them packed into plastic cups.
The Guardian also found a number of fléchettes in Irpin, where several residents said they had found them nailed on to their cars.
Bellingcat, a nonprofit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian and confirmed the presence of cluster bombs in towns and villages occupied by the Russians in Ukraine.
Russia’s withdrawal from the Kyiv region in early April has revealed evidence of cluster munitions – shells or bombs that release dozens of smaller munitions – in the wreckage of cars, streets and civilian buildings and in dead bodies. The weapons, banned in more than 100 countries (but not the US, Russia or Ukraine) under a 2008 treaty called the convention on cluster munitions, were unleashed in areas with no military personnel and no military infrastructure. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian allegations of war crimes are concocted.
The submunitions in a cluster bomb are designed to release over a wide area, but they do not always explode, posing a future risk to civilians.
The wrecks of dozens of cars in Bucha and Borodyanka, seen and photographed by the Guardian and reviewed by experts, show the characteristic holes caused by submunitions from cluster bombs used by the Russian military. The use of cluster bombs and cluster munitions has also been widely reported in other areas of Ukraine. When a team from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) entered an oncology hospital in Mykolaiv, south-east Ukraine, on 4 April, several explosions took place in close proximity to the staff.
The Guardian found a Russian cluster rocket near a farm village in Hostomel and fragments of tail fins from RBK-500 cluster bombs with PTAB-1M submunitions and cluster rockets in other towns north of Kyiv. The impact of cluster bombs in these areas was so large that in some cases they hit and killed numerous animals. A short distance from the cluster bomb found at Hostomel, the carcasses of two horses show clear marks of its submunitions on their bodies.
In Borodyanka, prosecutors have spent days exhuming dozens of victims who were hastily buried in local cemeteries by relatives during the bombing, because, according to the authorities, many of them were killed by cluster bombs. Coroners in areas north of Kyiv confirmed to the Guardian that they had found fragments of cluster munitions embedded in bodies dug out in the area. The findings are being classified by coroners and will be reported to The Hague, where charges of war crimes committed by Russia could be formalised in the coming months."

Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s ministry of defence claims to have destroyed a warehouse full of ammunition in Razdolovka which was stockpiling 155mm shells manufactured for American-made M-777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine.
Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Sieverodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.
Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine and is not “chasing deadlines”. “All the goals set by the president will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise,” he said.
The Russia-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Kherson region will ask Moscow to set up a military base on its territory, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reports. Russia successfully seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in mid-March which is adjacent to Crimea, the peninsula which Moscow has controlled since 2014.
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.”
A team of Colombian soldiers will travel to Europe to train their Ukrainian counterparts on de-mining techniques, the South American country’s defence minister has said.
Finland and Sweden will send delegations to Ankara tomorrow to try to resolve Turkish opposition to their applications for membership of the Nato military alliance, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto has said.
Poland has continued to signal its intent to bolster its defences in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Defence secretary Mariusz Blaszczak said the country intends to buy six additional Patriot missile batteries.
Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, says the war on Ukraine is putting the international order into question. She said the World Economic Forum at Davos should be talking about making the world better together, but instead they must talk about Putin’s invasion, where Russia’s playbook for the war “comes out of another century”. To rebuild Ukraine, she said “We should leave no stone unturned, including possibly using the Russian assets we have frozen.”
A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies.
A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over the invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation.
A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.
Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers were due to face war crimes trials, she said, and Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes.
Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a Harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, said Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary. The new security packages included “critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”.
Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume.
“Low-level” discussions were under way on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia.
The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days”, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. Robert Habeck also told German broadcaster ZDF that the European Commission and the US were working on a proposal to cap global oil prices rather than pay “any price”.
Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.
Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far.
The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face.
The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly.
New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain. The pictures released by Maxar Technologies seemingly back up claims from Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by.
Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business there. The Seattle-based coffee company has 130 stores and nearly 2,000 employees in Russia. McDonalds is also pulling out, removing the “golden arches” from Moscow before leaving for good."

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-viktor-orbans-brussels-bashing-a-reckoning-must-come;2022-05-23;The Guardian view on Viktor Orbán’s Brussels bashing: a reckoning must come;"The contempt shown by Hungary’s prime minister for EU norms requires a response
In recent years, as Viktor Orbán has consolidated his hold over Hungary’s body politic, he has acquired a cult following on America’s Republican right. That status was confirmed last week when US conservatives staged a special conference in Budapest, the centrepiece of which was an address by the newly re-elected prime minister. Speaking to the conference theme of “God, homeland, family”, the self-styled standard bearer for “illiberal democracy” did not hold back. Delegates were told that “ideologically trained bureaucrats” in Washington and Brussels – in cahoots with progressive liberals and “neo-Marxists” – were seeking to undermine traditional western values. Mr Orbán then outlined the strategy taken in Hungary to eradicate this threat. “The first point in the Hungarian formula,” he said, “is to play by our own rules.”
In that spirit, Mr Orbán’s Hungary has flouted the democratic norms of European Union membership for years. On issues relating to corruption, the independence of the media, asylum and LGBTQ+ rights, Budapest has flatly ignored EU objections to its actions. Mr Orbán has made domestic political capital from waging a culture war against Brussels, even as Hungary accessed billions of pounds worth of EU regional aid. As he trolls the EU ever more brazenly from within and gives masterclasses to America’s “alt-right”, what can Brussels do about it?
Up to now, despite a plethora of legal manoeuvres, the answer to that question has been not much. In 2018, the European parliament voted to pursue disciplinary action against Hungary under article 7 of the EU treaty, which is designed to protect the union’s fundamental values. But despite another Brussels hearing on the subject on Monday,matters have proceeded at a snail’s pace. Last month, the European Commission accused Hungary of “continuous breaches” of anti-corruption rules, triggering a formal process that could lead to the withholding of funds. But though the move was acclaimed by MEPs, this is likely to be a similarly drawn-out process.
The war in Ukraine has now complicated matters, giving Mr Orbán new leverage as the EU seeks to present a united front against Vladimir Putin. Hungary is the only member state refusing to sign up to a ban on Russian oil imports, despite concessions allowing it until 2024 to organise alternatives. Any eventual agreement is likely to come at a high price financially, in terms of assistance, and politically. As Lithuania’s foreign minister put it last week, “the whole union is being held hostage by one member state”.
For now, as the EU seeks to unite in the face of urgent geopolitical threats, it may have to put up with Mr Orbán’s efforts to undermine it from within. But a reckoning must surely come with a leader who holds its rules – and the values that inform them – in contempt. In theory, the article 7 process could lead to the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the EU. Almost certainly, there is neither the bandwidth nor the appetite in Brussels to go down that route, given current circumstances. But joining a club means playing by its rules, rather than your own. Sooner or later, there must be meaningful consequences for not doing so."

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the war in Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy and could result in recession for more vulnerable countries.
Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly.
Asked in a session on the world economy at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether the IMF was forecasting a global recession, Georgieva replied: “Not at this point. It doesn’t mean one is out of the question.”
The IMF managing director said her organisation had recently downgraded the growth prospects for 143 of its member states, which represent 80% of global output.
“Since then the horizon has darkened,” she said, pointing out that the impact of the war in Ukraine was being amplified by a tightening of financial conditions, a rising US dollar and a slowdown in China. “2022 is going to be a tough year.”
Along with other Davos attenders, the IMF head highlighted the risks of rising food prices. Georgieva said there had been a sense over the past week that the global economy was getting into rougher waters. The oil price had come down but “food prices continue to go up, up, up, up”.
She said: “We can shrink the use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day. The anxiety about access to food at a reasonable price, globally, is hitting the roof.”
The IMF is now predicting global growth of 3.6% this year, and Georgieva said it was a long way from turning negative. “What we may see is recession in some countries that are weak to begin with. They haven’t recovered from the Covid crisis. They’re highly dependent on imports from Russia, of energy or food, and they have a somewhat weaker environment already.”
Jane Fraser, the chief executive of the US investment bank Citigroup, told the same Davos panel that Europe looked particularly vulnerable. “Europe is right in the middle of the storms from supply chains, from the energy crisis, and obviously just the proximity to some of the atrocities that are occurring in Ukraine,” she said."

A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment.
Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.”
“Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,” wrote the diplomat, a 20-year veteran of the Russian foreign ministry. “It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.”
Bondarev is the highest-level diplomat yet to resign publicly from the Russian foreign ministry over the war, which began in February. In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Bondarev confirmed that he had written the statement and submitted his letter of resignation on Monday.
“The decision was very simple,” said Bondarev. “When you see that your country is doing the worst things and being a civil servant you’re somehow related to that, it’s your decision just to terminate your connection with the government. We all must be responsible. And I don’t want to have any responsibility for what I don’t approve of.”
Bondarev published the statement on his Facebook and LinkedIn accounts and also sent copies to diplomats and media outlets. He said he had walked into work on Monday, submitted his resignation, and walked out.
“The decision was made on February 24. But it took some time to gather some resolve to make it,” he said.
Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Geneva-based human rights organisation UN Watch, called Bondarev a “hero”.
“We are now calling on all other Russian diplomats at the United Nations – and worldwide – to follow his moral example and resign,” he said.
Neuer also called for Bondarev to be allowed to speak at this week’s Davos forum, a gathering of the world’s political and business elite at a mountain resort in Switzerland.
Bondarev’s statement was also confirmed by the Russian media outlet Kommersant, which said that it “also knows the names of several other diplomats who resigned from the Russian foreign ministry after the start of the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine, but almost none of them have made public statements about this”.
Bondarev, a counsellor on arms control at the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva, said that other Russian diplomats have similar feelings about the war but are unlikely to speak out.
“There are people who think the way that I think and see the situation for what it is,” he said. “But I don’t know whether some of them will follow my example. I don’t think that there will be many.”
He said he had not had any response yet from the foreign ministry after delivering his letter of resignation on Monday.
“I don’t know what the [Russian] reaction will be,” he said. “I don’t know what I am going to do either. No plans.”
Asked whether he had asked for asylum outside Russia, he said: “I think that if someone offers to help in this difficult situation, I think it would be very gratefully accepted.”
As to returning to Russia, he said that “would not be a very good idea right now”.
In his public statement, Bondarev took aim at top officials such as Vladimir Putin and Sergei Lavrov, calling the Russian foreign minister “a good illustration of the degradation of the system”.
“The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country,” he wrote.
“Those who conceived this war want only one thing – to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity,” he said. “To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.”
Bondarev is a career diplomat who has worked for the foreign ministry since 2002. He has served as an adviser on nuclear non-proliferation for nearly a decade, first in Moscow and then at Russia’s permanent mission to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva.
During that time, he said, he had stayed on as a diplomat even as relations deteriorated with the west because he felt there was “some room for diplomacy, some room to go back to normal somehow”.
“But now after February 24, we just jumped into an abyss and there can be no going back to normal, no going back to anywhere,” he continued. “Today of course we can see that there can be no negotiations, it’s just all-out war.”"

Ukraine’s president has given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day.
While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.
The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas.

“Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday evening.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region and that Severodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions”, though Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
The Donbas has been the scene of recent heavy fighting involving intense shelling by both sides, with Zelenskiy’s remarks appearing to be a reference to fatalities in combat. The high recent death toll on the Ukrainian side also suggests an even larger number of non-fatal casualties.
Historically a ratio of one killed in action to three wounded was regarded as a rough rule of thumb for assessing casualties, although better field medical treatment and evacuation, not least for US forces in theatres such as Afghanistan and Iraq, resulted in a far higher survival rate from injuries that would once have caused deaths.
According to a policy briefing paper published by the Belfer Center in 2014: “The ratio of wounded to killed in battle has increased dramatically as a result of improvements in medical care in conflict zones. This shift is particularly relevant for technologically advanced countries such as the United States, which invest significant resources in military medicine.”
The new estimate came as Kyiv also revealed its worst military losses from a single attack of the Ukraine war on Monday, saying 87 people had been killed last week when Russian forces struck a barracks housing troops at a training base in the north.
The disclosure that scores had been killed in the attack demonstrated Russia’s ability to inflict huge losses, even far from the front. Previously, Kyiv had said eight people died in the 17 May strike on the barracks in the town of Desna.
“Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna, under the rubble, there were 87 casualties. Eighty-seven corpses,” Zelenskiy said during a speech made by video link to business leaders in Davos, Switzerland.
Moscow had said at the time that it hit a training base with long-range missiles. The toll Zelenskiy announced on Monday was more than double the number killed in a similar attack on a Ukrainian training base in Yaraviv in the west in March.
The updated death toll from Desna emerged following recent remarks by senior Ukrainian officials, including the president, that warned of increasing bloodshed in the next phase of the conflict, amid anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive later in the summer.
Zelenskiy’s acknowledgment of the increasingly heavy toll on Ukraine’s military follows claims by the UK’s Ministry of Defence that since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has probably suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan, although those claims could not be independently verified.
Like Ukraine, western allies including the UK have tended to emphasise Russian losses while avoiding the issue of Ukrainian losses as part of the information war with Moscow that appears in part aimed at trying to shift Russian public opinion against Putin’s invasion.
A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach that is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high Russian casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released on Monday morning.
Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. “The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.”"

Germany is to relax visa requirements for skilled workers from Russia, just as the country’s domestic intelligence agency warned of a heightened risk that Russian nationals working for German firms could be recruited for industrial espionage.
The chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is streamlining the visa application process by exempting Russian workers with specialised expertise in areas such as IT and communication technology from case-by-case assessments through the federal employment department.
The so-called “global approval for access to the labour market”, which applies only to Russian employees of German companies who are earning at least €43,992 a year, will last until 30 September.
Between the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of May, Germany issued more than 600 visas for Russian skilled workers, which allow for a longer stay in Germany than the 90-day so-called Schengen visa.
The German foreign office told the news agency dpa it had issued about 350 work visas via its Moscow embassy in April, in addition to a further 190 working visas issued by the general consulate in St Petersburg. Most of those in receipt of such visas were already working for German firms, dpa said.
Germany is already home to about 235,000 Russian passport holders, more than any other country in the European Union.
Only last week, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution issued a special warning that Russian nationals who were about to move to Germany, and those already working in the country, faced an increased risk of being blackmailed or otherwise put under pressure to collect information of use to a Russian economy increasingly cut off from global knowledge networks.
“Russia is increasingly isolated through the sanctions imposed in reaction to the war in Ukraine”, the report said. “Its economy is cut off from the knowhow and technologies of the west.”
Recruitment attempts could take place during mandatory appointments with Russian embassies or other bureaucratic bodies, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said. “They may also try to exercise pressure via reprisals against relatives or acquaintances who have remained in Russia”, the report continued. “In general, Russian intelligence services do not shy away from methods like threats and blackmail.”
Asked if the German government was introducing special measures to vet Russian working visa applicants, a spokesperson said: “Standard security checks of applicants are being made within the visa process.”
The decision to ease entry for Russian skilled workers comes as human rights NGOs said the German government was not doing enough to ease the visa application process for independent journalists facing repression in Russia.
About 70 Russian journalists and media professionals, most of them employees of the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd and the news website Meduza, have been put on a humanitarian visa list drawn up by the German culture ministry but do not yet qualify for the more generous visas for skilled workers.
“We want to offer Russian journalists who are being persecuted in Russia protection in Germany,” a spokesperson for the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said on Monday. “We want to ease entry and speed up processes.”"

We are closing in on a new harvest and there is no other practical way of exporting the grain except through the Black Sea port of Odesa,” he told the Guardian. “There is no way of storing this grain and no other adequate alternative route. It is imperative that we show vulnerable countries we are prepared to take the steps that are needed to feed the world.”
Landsbergis proposed that a naval escort operation – not run by Nato – could protect the grain ships as they headed through the Black Sea and past Russian warships. He suggested that, apart from Britain, countries that were affected by the potential loss of grain such as Egypt could provide the necessary protection.
“What we have seen now is just the beginning. The worst is yet to come in the next five to seven weeks when the first harvest arrives and there is no place to put it, so that means people in northern Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia will be paying exorbitant prices for wheat, corn and the other commodities they need to put food on their table”. He said Ukraine needed to export 80m tonnes of wheat alone this year and the only option was through Odesa,.

His plan, under gestation for weeks, would require demining parts of the Black Sea to ensure safe passage, as well as the agreement of Turkey, which guards the entrance to the Black Sea.
“This would be a non-military humanitarian mission and is not comparable with a no-fly zone,” he said. “In this endeavour military ships or planes or both would be used to ensure that the grain supplies can leave Odesa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference. We would need a coalition of the willing – countries with significant naval power to protect the shipping lanes, and countries that are affected by this”.
Nato as an alliance should not take a role, he said.
After meeting Landsbergis, Truss said the UK would want British naval ships to join the escort if the practicalities could be sorted, including demining the harbour and providing Ukraine with longer-range weapons to defend the harbour from Russian attack. The UK is in discussions with allies about the plan and it would probably need US agreement to be activated.
Truss said: “What we need to do is deal with this global food security issue and the UK is working on an urgent solution to get the grain out of Ukraine”.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned of “a hurricane of hunger” if Ukrainian grain is not exported. The world’s 41 least-developed nations import a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Soaring food prices have already driven inflation levels in Egypt to the highest level since mid-2019.
Asked how Britain had reacted to his plan, Landsbergis said: “From my perspective the British government is interested in assisting Ukraine in any way it can. The UK has taken some very strong and decisive steps in this crisis and maybe there is a chance that the UK will participate. Britain was the first country to provide rockets to shield Odesa”.
He said Lithuania, one of Ukraine’s closest allies in the west, had been looking into how Ukraine would feed the world for weeks.
Landsbergis said alternative routes by rail through Belarus or by road to the Baltic Sea ports in Poland and Lithuania had severe practical drawbacks, while bottlenecks and complete overload would mean it would take Ukrainian trucks five to nine weeks to reach ports by road either in Romania, Poland or Lithuania.
Turkey, Landsbergis acknowledged, had its doubts about the escalation potential inherent in his scheme. However, he pointed out that as a major importer of grain, Turkey had a self-interest in the naval lanes being opened up if Russia would not voluntarily lift the blockade.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world.
In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum (WEF), Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia.
Ukraine’s president called for the implementation of “maximum sanctions” against Vladimir Putin’s regime and said there would be no point to Davos if Russian aggression was allowed to prevail.
Noting that history was at a turning point, Zelenskiy said: “This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world.”
Zelenskiy received a standing ovation and concluded his 45-minute session at the WEF by sending out a collective message to business leaders, telling them they should “wake up each morning with the feeling ‘what have I done for Ukraine today?’”.
Russia’s absence from this year’s Davos gathering has provided Ukraine with an opportunity to make its case for a stepping up of the west’s economic war against Russia, with Zelenskiy’s team of ministers at the WEF all urging tougher action.
Earlier Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, called for secondary sanctions against companies that continued to do business in Russia. “Now is not the time for a cost benefit analysis. We have to cut Russia off from the global economy completely,” Svyrydenko said.
Citing the example of the Munich agreement in 1938, Zelenskiy called for the withdrawal of all foreign companies from Russia so they were not used in the “bloody interests” of the Kremlin.
He said any company quitting Russia was welcome to move to Ukraine, where they could help with the massive task of repairing the colossal damage to an economy expected to shrink by at least 30% this year.
“We offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour,” he said. “I invite you to take part in this rebuilding.”
Zelenskiy said he was looking at alternative ways of getting Ukraine’s food out of the country after accusing Russia of stealing grain supplies ready for export. Talks are under way with Poland to see if food could be shipped out of ports on the Baltic Sea.
He added a corridor should be established for exports such as wheat and sunflower oil, to prevent a food crisis for countries in Africa and Asia.
Sir Lawrence Freedman, the emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said he agreed about the urgent need for international agreement to secure a good corridor because the blockading of Ukraine’s food was “looming large now”.
Freedman added: “The Ukraine line is there’s no time to waste. Just hit hard, hit now, and we need all the support we can get. And don’t nod in the direction of the Russians, they’ve got nothing to give you.”"

A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine.
Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.
The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge Serhii Ahafonov in a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small chamber.
The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he did not mean to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. “The murder was committed with direct intent,” he said.
Shishimarin, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, listened to the judge deliver his long verdict with his head bowed from inside the glass box for defendants. He was given a translation of the judge’s words from Ukrainian to Russian by a court-appointed translator.
Shishimarin was commanding a tank division from the Moscow region that came under attack on 28 February, prosecutors said. The attack led the Russian soldiers to disperse and Shishimarin ended up stealing a car with four other soldiers.
When they saw Shelipov riding a bicycle and speaking on his mobile phone, one of the other soldiers told Shishimarin to shoot him, for fear he would give away their positions. Shishimarin fired three or four shots at Shelipov from his Kalashnikov.
“I was ordered to shoot, so I opened fire on him and he fell. We carried on driving,” he said in a video interrogation released by Ukraine’s SBU security services.
Shishimarin pleaded guilty to the crime, but his lawyer argued that his client was following an order and did not have intent to kill. Shishimarin also apologised to the wife of the victim.
“The court cannot recognise the sincerity of his repentance,” Ahafonov said in his verdict.
Shishimarin was whisked away from the court after the hearing in the back of a police van. He has 30 days to launch an appeal.
Speaking outside the courthouse, Shishimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov said he would challenge the verdict. “This is the most severe sentence and any level-headed person would challenge it,” he said. He added that he believed “societal pressure” had influenced the court’s decision.
The prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the ruling was “lawful and justified”.
It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases related to war crimes that could come to trial soon, and Ukrainian authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes across the country.
Trying cases so quickly, while the conflict rages on, is extremely unusual and may violate elements of the Geneva conventions, legal experts say. However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit.
In an interview with the Russian independent news outlet Meduza, Shishimarin’s mother, Lyubov, claimed her son was a caring and kind young man who had joined the army partly because there was a lack of opportunity in their home town, and partly to help support the family after his stepfather was killed last year.
She said her son called in late February and said: “Mummy, I won’t have a telephone for a week, I have to give it up. If someone tells you I went to Ukraine, don’t believe them.” The next she heard of him was when she found out he was a prisoner in Ukraine, she said.
Shelipov’s widow, Katerina, identified Shishimarin as the man who shot her husband during a court hearing last week, and told the court she hoped he would receive a life sentence. “But if he is traded for our defenders of Azovstal, I would not mind,” she said.
There has been some speculation that once convicted, Shishmarin and others may be used as part of an exchange for Ukrainians held by Russia, including the more than 2,000 defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol who recently surrendered to the Russians.
Russian officials have veered between calling for harsh punishments, including even the death penalty, for some of the fighters, and suggesting they may be open to an exchange.
On Monday Denis Pushilin, the leader of Russia-backed Donetsk separatists, said there should be an “international tribunal” for the Azovstal defenders, many of whom have been called “Nazis” by Russian authorities.
“If an enemy [soldier] has laid down his arms, his future fate is decided by a court, if he is a Nazi criminal, this will be a tribunal,” Pushilin said.
The Kremlin said on Monday it was following the Shishimarin case. “Of course we are worried about the fate of our citizen. Unfortunately we have no possibilities to defend his interests there,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday. He said the Kremlin would use “other channels” to assist Shishimarin."

In recent weeks, the western public has been obsessed with the question “What goes on in Putin’s mind?” Western pundits wonder: do the people around him tell him the whole truth? Is he ill or going insane? Are we pushing him into a corner where he will see no other way out to save face than to accelerate the conflict into a total war?
We should stop this obsession with the red line, this endless search for the right balance between support for Ukraine and avoiding total war. The “red line” is not an objective fact: Putin himself is redrawing it all the time, and we contribute to his redrawing with our reactions to Russia’s activities. A question like “Did US intelligence-sharing with Ukraine cross a line?” makes us obliterate the basic fact: it was Russia itself which crossed the line, by attacking Ukraine. So instead of perceiving ourselves as a group which just reacts to Putin as an impenetrable evil genius, we should turn the gaze back at ourselves: what do we – the “free west” – want in this affair?
We must analyze the ambiguity of our support of Ukraine with the same cruelty we analyze Russia’s stance. We should reach beyond double standards applied today to the very foundations of European liberalism. Remember how, in the western liberal tradition, colonization was often justified in the terms of the rights of working people. John Locke, the great Enlightenment philosopher and advocate of human rights, justified white settlers grabbing land from Native Americans with a strange left-sounding argument against excessive private property. His premise was that an individual should be allowed to own only as much land as he is able to use productively, not large tracts of land that he is not able to use (and then eventually rents to others). In North America, as he saw it, Indigenous people were using vast tracts of land mostly just for hunting, and the white settlers who wanted to use it for intense agriculture had the right to seize it for the benefit of humanity.
In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, both sides present their acts as something they simply had to do: the west had to help Ukraine remain free and independent; Russia was compelled to intervene militarily to protect its safety. The latest example: the Russian foreign ministry claiming Russia will be “forced to take retaliatory steps” if Finland joins Nato. No, it will not be “forced”, in the same way that Russia was not “forced” to attack Ukraine. This decision appears “forced” only if one accepts the whole set of ideological and geopolitical assumptions that sustain Russian politics.
These assumptions have to be analyzed closely, without any taboos. One often hears that we should draw a strict line of separation between Putin’s politics and the great Russian culture, but this line of separation is much more porous than it may appear. We should resolutely reject the idea that, after years of patiently trying to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations, Russia was finally forced/compelled to attack Ukraine – one is never forced to attack and annihilate a whole country. The roots are much deeper; I am ready to call them properly metaphysical.
Anatoly Chubais, the father of Russian oligarchs (he orchestrated Russia’s rapid privatization in 1992), said in 2004: “I’ve reread all of Dostoevsky over the past three months. And I feel nothing but almost physical hatred for the man. He is certainly a genius, but his idea of Russians as special, holy people, his cult of suffering and the false choices he presents make me want to tear him to pieces.” As much as I dislike Chubais for his politics, I think he is right about Dostoevsky, who provided the “deepest” expression of the opposition between Europe and Russia: individualism versus collective spirit, materialist hedonism versus the spirit of sacrifice.
Russia now presents its invasion as a new step in the fight for decolonization, against western globalization. In a text published earlier this month, Dmitry Medvedev, the ex-president of Russia and now the deputy secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, wrote that “the world is waiting for the collapse of the idea of an American-centric world and the emergence of new international alliances based on pragmatic criteria.” (“Pragmatic criteria” means disregard for universal human rights, of course.)
So we should also draw red lines, but in a way which makes clear our solidarity with developing countries. Medvedev predicts that, because of the war in Ukraine, “in some states, hunger may occur due to the food crisis” – a statement of breathtaking cynicism. As of May 2022, about 25m metric tons of grain are slowly rotting in Odesa, on ships or in silos, since the port is blocked by the Russian navy. “The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that millions of people are ‘marching towards starvation’ unless ports in southern Ukraine which have been closed because of the war, are reopened,” Newsweek reports. Europe now promises to help Ukraine transport the grain by railway and truck – but this is clearly not enough. A step more is needed: a clear demand to open the port for the export of grain, inclusive of sending protective military ships there. It’s not about Ukraine, it’s about the hunger of hundreds of millions in Africa and Asia. Here should the red line be drawn.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently said: “Imagine [the Ukraine war] is happening in Africa, or the Middle East. Imagine Ukraine is Palestine. Imagine Russia is the United States.” As expected, comparing the conflict in Ukraine with the plight of the Palestinians “offended many Israelis, who believe there are no similarities”, Newsweek noted. “For example, many point out that Ukraine is a sovereign, democratic country, but don’t consider Palestine as a state.” Of course Palestine is not a state because Israel denies its right to be a state – in the same way Russia denies the right of Ukraine to be a sovereign state. As much as I find Lavrov’s remarks repulsive, he sometimes deftly manipulates the truth.
Yes, the liberal west is hypocritical, applying its high standards very selectively. But hypocrisy means you violate the standards you proclaim, and in this way you open yourself up to inherent criticism – when we criticize the liberal west, we use its own standards. What Russia is offering is a world without hypocrisy – because it is without global ethical standards, practicing just pragmatic “respect” for differences. We have seen clearly what this means when, after the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, they instantly made a deal with China. China accepts the new Afghanistan while the Taliban will ignore what China is doing to Uyghurs – this is, in nuce, the new globalization advocated by Russia. And the only way to defend what is worth saving in our liberal tradition is to ruthlessly insist on its universality. The moment we apply double standards, we are no less “pragmatic” than Russia.

The full story of the trials of Anastasiya Tykha, 20, a veterinary student in the final year of her degree, and her husband Arthur Lee, 26, is perhaps even more striking than the photograph, which the couple discovered had gone viral when Tykha saw herself on the television news and listened to the presenter report that she was dead.
Speaking in Irpin, the town 13 miles north of Kyiv from where the couple had fled on 9 March, Tykha said they ended up making seven crossings of the bridge in total, each one under fire.
“We had too much to do to be worried or scared”, said Tykha, who has run an animal shelter in Irpin for four years, and who on that first journey was seeking to escape with 19 dogs, five cats, a turtle, a chameleon, two Triton lizards, an axolotl and a hamster.
It was not an easy decision to flee, but the Russians had wrestled control of the town, there was no electricity or running water and the dogs were having to drink from the shelter’s aquarium.
It was Snizhana Bugryk, 35, a friend who was involved in finding abandoned and disabled animals for Tykha and Lee’s shelter, who persuaded the couple that they had no choice but to leave.
“Snizhana said we had to go or we would be killed, that this was our last chance for us and the animals to survive,” said Tykha. “And she was right”, added Lee. “Our house was later in the heart of the heavy fighting.”
It was a two-mile walk to the bridge where Ukrainian soldiers were helping people across.
Two of the dogs – Strong and Baileys, mongrel border collies with broken spines – were in wheelchairs, while Life, a four-year-old with amputated legs, had refused to be strapped in and was dragging herself on her stumps. “I did think at one point that we would not make it,” said Lee, “but Snizhana called and said there would be a minibus on the other side to help”.
It took three hours to get to the bridge. One dog, Pandora, a one-and-a-half-year-old mongrel Belgian shepherd, was so terrified that he bit off part of his tongue, while four of the others, including the couple’s own dog, Zeus, a beagle, became so worked up by the sounds of war they chewed through their leads and ran away.
Arriving exhausted at the Ukrainian checkpoint by the bridge, the couple and their animals drew the attention of press photographers, who crowded around them.
“That was when that photo was taken – I just wanted them to let us get through to the bridge,” said Tykha. “I was worried because there were burned out cars and lots of smashed glass and metal, and I didn’t want the animals to be cut up.”
A group of Ukrainian soldiers came to their aid, ushering the photographers away. “There were explosions and shooting but after two weeks of Russian occupation, we were used to it,” Lee said.
The couple found the minivan and it took them to a south-western district of Kyiv, where a sauna on the side of a house had been made available to them and their animals to stay in.
It was the next day that the couple discovered that their adventures were being talked about across Ukraine, and that Tykha was presumed dead.
They were determined to go back to find Zeus and the other dogs who had fled in fear.
“We were in the sauna for five days, but every one of those days Anastasiya went to the Ukrainian military checkpoint and demanded that she be allowed through to get the escaped dogs,” said Lee. Every day the commander at the checkpoint refused, and every day she came back. He was finally browbeaten into submission.
After crossing the bridge, again under fire, they faced a three-mile walk to a an abandoned animal shelter, where they knew there were hungry dogs who needed help.
“It was a hard walk because we had all this heavy food,” said Lee. They returned to their own home, where they found Zeus, and picked up some neighbours’ dogs, including a German shepherd, bringing their party of animals for the return to five.
They would make two further trips, and all the dogs that fled on the first escape were accounted for.
Lee said their final trip back to Irpin, on 29 March, was the scariest. “The council had said that the Russians had gone the previous day and that it was safe – but it wasn’t,” Lee said. “The bombs were landing just 2 metres from us. We hid between the minivan and a fence, but it was close.”
Now they are back in Irpin in a new, rented house. Because so many former residents have left, their collection of sheltered animals has grown to 30 dogs and 10 cats. They are, the couple say, just happy to be living the life they love."

Good morning. When the war in Ukraine first began, the fall of Kyiv, and the Ukrainian state more broadly, seemed highly likely. Almost three months on, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. Russia has suffered a series of significant military setbacks that make any victory for them look a much more distant and difficult prospect – but a swift win for Ukraine doesn’t look likely either.
As the war begins to enter a protracted phase, and with decisive developments on the ground becoming rarer and harder to read, I spoke to some experts about how the war in Ukraine might develop. First, though, the headlines – and a programming note: from today, we’ll be adding the Guardian’s crosswords to the First Edition mix. You’ll find links to them at the bottom of the email.
Ukraine | Ukraine’s primary negotiator in peace talks, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said that there will not be a ceasefire deal with Russia if it involves ceding any territory to Russia.

Australia | Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has been sworn in as the country’s 31st prime minister in Canberra.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the discussion on how and when the conflict would end has been at the top of the agenda. Here are four scenarios for an end to the violence:
Ukraine wins
A Ukrainian victory means different things to different people. To some it is pushing Russia back to the territories it controlled before the start of the invasion; for others it’s about pushing it back to the pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed Crimea.
Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum and the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, told me that a real victory for Ukraine is one where the country is in a more secure position than it was before the war began. This is the second Russian-Ukrainian war in the last decade, she notes, and a meaningful victory should stop a third war from ever happening. Practically speaking, in the short term, Orysia says, “Ukraine will have to push Russia out of as much territory as possible, including the occupation in the south and in Donbas”.
But there is a larger issue. “A Ukrainian victory means that Putin’s doctrine and Russian revanchism is contained [in Russia] and, eventually, put an end to completely,” Orysia says. Anything else is an “interim solution” (which isn’t to be discounted if it could stop the immediate effects of war). But to claim any real long term resolution, she adds, the underlying problems that caused the war must be addressed and dealt with. And, perhaps most importantly, Orysia argues, the mistakes of 2015 cannot be repeated: “Ukraine was pushed into concessions and a ceasefire agreement that, in the end, only gave Putin an upper hand to prepare for a bigger war.”
Russia wins
A Russian victory is more difficult to imagine for a number of reasons. I spoke to senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison, who has been covering the war on the ground, about what it might look like. “First of all, it’s important to differentiate between whether the whole world is saying Russia won or if Putin decides to declare victory himself – because those are potentially two quite different things,” she says. Another reason why it’s so difficult to envision what victory for Russia might look like is that the goalposts have moved so dramatically since the start of the war. “Putin’s objectives were pretty clear: to take Kyiv and install a puppet government,” Emma says. “But now that seems militarily impossible.”
Another road to victory is to simply run down the clock, with Russia working under the assumption that, even if the west keeps supplying Ukraine with arms, Kyiv’s army might run out of military personnel. Or, as time wears on, the war may just fall down the agenda in western countries, and resources and capital may slowly stop flowing in. This could lead to a situation where Ukraine capitulates, but this would take years. A victory in this scenario would look like mass loss of life, much of Ukraine levelled, and economic devastation for both countries.
A negotiated settlement
One way the war could end, is the way that many wars in history have ended – some kind of peace deal. Dr Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London, sees such a settlement as difficult to achieve. Russia’s initial demands from Ukraine were unworkable, he argues: “Demilitarisation is not likely to happen and ‘de-nazification’, whatever that means in the Ukrainian context, is a mythological problem, so it doesn’t really have anything other than a mythological solution.” These things cannot be negotiated, partly because they’re non-negotiables from the Ukrainian perspective, but also because some of the problems are entirely within the heads of the Russian government, Greene says.
The other sticking point is that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is an elected representative of the Ukrainian people – any settlement has to be mandated by them too. “They would not support a negotiated solution that would cede control of Ukrainian territory on a permanent basis,” Greene adds.
So a negotiated settlement would have to mean that Russia would move away from some of its stated aims and Ukraine would have to move to some kind of neutrality status (this means that, under international law, Ukraine won’t interfere in armed conflict involving other belligerent parties – and crucially it cannot allow a belligerent party to use their country in any kind of militaristic capacity).
The most important question in all of this, Greene says, is what the west’s response will be because their priority is keeping Russia isolated at least to some degree to stop them from waging further war. “The more you keep Russia isolated the harder it is for them to reinvest in their military,” he says. “So sanctions actually do become a tool of military engagement.” But in the context of a settlement, the international community would need to prioritise peace, not maximum humiliation for Russia.
A ceasefire
The most likely end to the violence will not be an end to the war at all, but a ceasefire, says Greene. “Zelenskiy has been clear about his willingness to talk to the Russians, if the Russians are willing to talk openly and honestly about some kind of a ceasefire arrangement that will stop people from dying.” It’s the quickest and most effective way to curb the continued violence without anyone having to admit defeat, and a process the Ukrainian president restated his willingness to embark upon over the weekend.
While the relief of a ceasefire would be welcome, it could have unwelcome consequences, too. As in the years after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a prolonged stalemate could just give space and capacity for Russia to re-strategise and reinvest in its military – which could ultimately lead to an even lengthier war.

The warning about rising energy bills from Michael Lewis, the boss of E.ON, is the lead in several papers this morning. The headline on the Times splash is “Fuel poverty predicted to hit 40% of households” whereas the Mirror says: “Energy boss: prices are too high”. The Express splash headline takes a figure from Lewis’s warning and leads with “Time for rescue Plan, Rishi! Energy bills to hit £3,000”, while the Daily Record also focuses on that big increase in costs: “Energy bills to hit £3000 a year”. The i has “Cost of living help on hold as PM focuses on Partygate”.
The Guardian reports that Boris Johnson is going to say that work is the best way to cope with rising energy bills, but its main story is another alarming statistic: “Children’s mental health in crisis as cases rocket to a record high”. The Mail leads with “PM allies accuse Sue Gray of ‘playing politics’” but the Telegraph looks further afield for its lead: “Gene-edited crops to help ease Ukraine food crisis”. The FT has “Investors challenged by demise of three-decade era of globalisation” and the Scotsman’s main story is “Minister urges workers to be ‘sensible’ over pay”.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/kyiv-museums-exhibit-russian-artefacts-with-pride-and-a-warning;2022-05-23;Kyiv museums exhibit Russian artefacts with pride and a warning;"Relics of the failed siege of the Ukrainian capital ‘show what happens when lessons of history are not learned’
A young woman takes a selfie in front of the burned-out carcass of a Russian armoured personnel carrier. A child eating an ice cream peers at the remains of a tank turret. A curious pensioner photographs the label on some mangled plane fuselage, which explains it belonged to a Russian Su-25, shot down by the Ukrainian military on 2 March.
Vladimir Putin doubtless envisioned a scenario in which Russian military hardware would stand on Kyiv’s central streets this spring, but he probably did not imagine it would look like this.
Here on Kriposnyi Lane, just a few minutes’ walk from the compound where Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spent the last three months evading reported Russian plans to kill him, Ukraine’s military history museum has opened a street exhibition of captured Russian hardware.
Inside the museum, there is a temporary display of souvenirs, trophies and evidence of the Russian occupation of the towns and villages around Kyiv.
“Many soldiers had been here on excursions before, so they knew where to bring things they had found,” said Oleksandr Shemelyak, a senior researcher at the museum. “All the time we are getting new items to put on display.”
Across Kyiv, at the museum of the second world war, an even larger exhibition has opened, which is named Crucified Ukraine, and also features both captured hardware outside and a vast array of items chronicling the Russian occupation around Kyiv.
The Russian army began its push towards Kyiv from the north, west and east in the first days of the war, and spent more than a month occupying areas around the capital before a chaotic withdrawal at the beginning of April, effectively an admission of failure.
“Three days after the liberation, the museum staff set off on missions to collect artefacts, accompanied by the Ukrainian military,” said Dmytro Hainetdinov, head of the museum’s education department.
Some of the exhibits look almost like artworks: more than a hundred pairs of Russian army boots, of different shapes and sizes, are arranged inside a red star. A charred church cupola hangs in the air among various other artefacts recovered from three different churches that were destroyed during the fighting. An icon with a hole in it made by shrapnel forms the centre of the display.
Other items on display include the passports, bank cards and other personal effects of Russian soldiers. There is a map of the left bank of Kyiv, with police stations and other strategic points carefully marked using coloured coding; it was allegedly seized from a Russian diversionary group operating inside the city during the first days of the war.
In the basement, the staff have recreated a shelter used by residents of the town of Hostomel, who spent more than a month below ground during the occupation. All the contents are original, from the blankets, teabags, salami and makeshift memorial plaque for a woman who died during the occupation.
The museum believes the artefacts are important to preserve for posterity, but also wants those Ukrainians who did not experience occupation to be able to see the horror for themselves. “Many people left for safer places, and are now returning, and happily, they did not have to experience these things first hand,” said Hainetdinov.
Upstairs, a television screen shows footage of Russian politicians, television hosts and ordinary citizens making derogatory statements about Ukrainians, in an attempt to show how such rhetoric can lay the groundwork for what has happened in recent months.
“This is a project that shows what happens when the lessons of history are not learned,” said Hainetdinov."

A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia’s 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing the 62-year-old man in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February after being ordered to shoot at him from a car.
Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko has said that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”.
Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last night that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region.
Donetsk’s self-proclaimed separatist leader Denis Pushilin has said that “The prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia was concerned by the trial of a Russian serviceman in Kyiv charged with war crimes, adding that it could not defend his interests in person.
Peskov also warned that Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He proposed a full oil embargo and cutting off all of Russia’s banks from the international monetary system.
Zelenskiy suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war.
Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed.
Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report.
A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine.
Belarus’s army has begun checking its weaponry and logistics equipment to make sure they are combat-ready, its ministry of defence said, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said the army was carrying out checks on equipment in long-term storage. “The inspection will determine the condition of the equipment and its readiness to carry out its tasks,” it said.
Lithuania has called for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London.
A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years”, France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying,” Clément Beaune said. “It’s probably in 15 or 20 years. It takes a long time.”
Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes.
Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since, “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her.
The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries.
Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from president Vladimir Putin’s military.
Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west.
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.
New Zealand will deploy another 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes."

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/23/total-displaced-people-now-at-staggering-milestone-of-100m-says-un;2022-05-22;Number of displaced people passes 100m for the first time, says UN;"‘Staggering milestone’ calls for urgent international action to address underlying causes of conflict, persecution and the climate crisis, says high commissioner for refugees
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the global number of forcibly displaced people has passed 100 million for the first time, describing it as a “staggering milestone”.
The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the grim new statistic should act as a wake-up call for the international community and that more action is needed internationally to address the root causes of forced displacement around the world.
Officials said that the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution had risen to an unprecedented level due to the war in Ukraine along with other deadly conflicts.
“One hundred million is a stark figure – sobering and alarming in equal measure,” said Grandi. “This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes.”
The figure hit 90 million at the end of 2021, propelled by a range of conflicts including in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nigeria.
Eight million Ukrainian people have been displaced within their home country as a result of the war, along with more than six million refugee movements registered from Ukraine.
“The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Grandi. “Compassion is alive and we need similar mobilisation for all crises around the world. But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure. To reverse this trend the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight or exile.”
The term “displaced person” was first used during the second world war, in which more than 40 million people were forcibly displaced.
A report from the House of Lords library in December 2021 cites UNHCR statistics that the number of people forcibly displaced globally exceeded 84 million by mid-2021. This was an increase from the estimated 82.4 million at the end of 2020. Armed conflicts, violence and human rights violations were leading causes. The report also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic, disasters, extreme weather, and the other effects of climate breakdown had created additional challenges for displaced people.
UNHCR reported that, by the end of June 2021, the number of refugees under its mandate had surpassed 20.8 million, an increase of 172,000 on the end of 2020. More than half of those who were granted international protection were from five countries – Central African Republic (71,800), South Sudan (61,700), Syria (38,800), Afghanistan (25,200) and Nigeria (20,300).
Syria continued to account for the world’s largest refugee population. Venezuelans were the second largest group and Afghans made up the third largest group.
The three countries hosting the most displaced people were Turkey with 3,696,800, Colombia with 1,743,900 and Uganda with 1,475,300.
On 16 June UNHCR will release its annual Global Trends report outlining a full set of global, regional and national data for 2021 along with more limited updates to April 2022."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal-territory-donbas;2022-05-22;Ukraine rules out any ceasefire deal that involves ceding territory to Russia;"Presidential aide calls for ‘complete restoration of territorial integrity’ as Polish president backs stance during Kyiv visit
Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region on Sunday.
“The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, in a Twitter post.
The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, offered Warsaw’s backing, telling politicians in Kyiv that the international community had to demand Russia’s complete withdrawal and that sacrificing any of Ukraine’s territory would be a “huge blow” to the west.
“Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands,” Duda said, in the first in-person address to the Ukrainian parliament by a foreign leader since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. “Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future,” he said.
On Saturday Ukraine’s lead negotiator in the stalled peace talks, Mykhailo Podolyak, said: “Any concession to Russia is not a path to peace, but a war postponed for several years. Ukraine trades neither its sovereignty nor territories and Ukrainians living on them.”
A few hours before, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had suggested that his government was willing to resume talks with Russia as long as Moscow did not kill Ukrainian troops who had been defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
After calls for an immediate ceasefire from the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, Podolyak made clear that Ukraine would not accept any deal with Russia that involved ceding territory, and that agreeing to a ceasefire now while making concessions to Russia would backfire on Ukraine because “Moscow would hit back harder after any break in fighting”.
Meanwhile on Sunday, Russian forces continued their bombardment of frontline Ukrainian cities, waging a major offensive in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas. Moscow’s goal – having taken full control of the port city of Mariupol, in what was perhaps Moscow’s biggest capture of the nearly three-month war – is to seize the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the region and gain military momentum.
Controlling Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, with mainland Russia and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.
Shelling and missile strikes hit Kharkiv in northern Ukraine and Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, while eight civilians were killed on the eastern front in the Donbas, Ukrainian officials said.
Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s defence ministry, said Russian rockets struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, about 60 miles (100km) north-east of the city of Mykolaiv.
On the Donetsk frontline, Russian forces were trying to break through Ukrainian defences to reach the administrative borders of the Luhansk region, while farther north they continued heavy shelling of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, according to Ukraine’s general staff.
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, its twin city on the other side of the Siverskiy Donets River, form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv and shifting its focus to the east and south of the country.
Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said that although Severodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions”, the Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
The Russian army has flattened the Black Sea port of Mariupol during its siege and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to relentless ground and artillery attacks.
“There is no work, no food, no water,” said Angela Kopytsa, 52, breaking into tears as she spoke to AFP reporters on a Russian-organised tour of Mariupol. Kopytsa said her home and her life had been destroyed during the fighting and that children on maternity wards were dying of hunger.

The last child in a ruined village in north-east Ukraine has been evacuated with his family from the basement in which they lived for three months after a benefactor read of their plight in the Guardian.
Tymofiy Seidov, eight, did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, owing to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova, and a second woman in the basement, Alla Lisnenko, 59.
“When we took Tymofiy out of the bomb shelter, he kept holding my hand,” Rita said. “He kept telling me ‘Mum, let’s go back inside, Mum, let’s hide, Mum, let’s not be out in the open.’”
Kutuzivka, 12 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, has been on the frontline of the war since 24 February and it was retaken from Russian forces three weeks ago, at a heavy price for those living among its ruins.
The village was bombed throughout and of the 1,500 people who had lived there only about 50 remain – most of whom had been living alongside Tymofiy in the dark, dusty cellar where the young boy spent much of his time drawing pictures of monsters, tanks and remembered beaches and happier days under the sun.
Along with Rita, his aunt Yana, 33, grandmother Lyudmyla, 57 and grandfather Mykola, 62, Tymofiy is now heading to the relative safety of western Ukraine, but the family’s final destination is Zurich in Switzerland, where more than 40,000 Ukrainian refugees have made a home since the war began.
Their future remains full of uncertainty as they look to resettle in a strange country without money or the ability to speak the local languages, yet Rita said the family had no choice but to flee the fighting.
“At first Tymofiy did not want to leave Kutuzivka,” she said. “He was very upset when we told him we were leaving. I think he is now afraid of travelling. He cried. He was afraid of artillery shelling when we were taken from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv.
“He is afraid of shelling throughout Ukraine. Alla, as a mother, and we all talked to him and convinced him that we are going to a place where nothing will shoot and where everything will be quiet.”
Rita said her son’s health had begun to wane after living for 87 days with 23 other people in the almost pitch black 40-by-five-metre basement below the ruins of two-storey kindergarten and medical centre.
“Tymofiy was examined by a doctor and diagnosed with an allergy to dust from the basement,” Rita said. “This dust from the basement walls, which Tymofiy was breathing all the time, had begun to cause an allergic reaction.”
The family’s evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help, while the Ukrainian military agreed to provide safe passage. The reader did not want to be identified but said he hoped others would donate funds to help Tymofiy and his family, and he called for a greater political effort in the west to “prevent the suffering of millions caused by the insanity of the few”.
Rita said making the decision to leave Kutuzivka had been difficult, although it was confirmed as the right move as they emerged from the basement to see the full scale of the damage wreaked on her village.
She said: “My mother cried all the time, all these days when we were packing she cried. She cried all the way from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv railway station. When we started to leave Kutuzivka we saw how our village was destroyed. We saw that Kutuzivka was in ruins.
“This was the first time we saw our village because all these days we were constantly in the basement. And when we went out and saw the scale of the destruction, I had a lump in my throat from pain and sadness. We had lived in our peaceful village for a long time and in one moment it has been destroyed. It was very painful for us to look at it.”
She went on: “My parents really didn’t want to go. They did not want to leave their home. But I convinced them. Because we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. We are afraid that tomorrow the war may return to our village. I told my parents it was safe. We will not be constantly under fire and we needed to go.”
Rita said she hoped in the future to help others to escape, and she would never forget the aid given to her by the readers of the Guardian. “If I could, I would also help people – take them to safe places, would help them settle,” she said. “After we experienced all this horror in Kutuzivka, I realised how important evacuation is for people from dangerous places.”"

Russian soldier’s Ukrainian lawyer defends role on eve of verdict;"Viktor Ovsyannikov speaks out on his defence of a 21-year-old tank commander who shot and killed an unarmed civilian
Defending a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine is no easy task, which is why some people have described Viktor Ovsyannikov as “the devil’s advocate”.
But the 43-year-old Ukrainian is unrepentant. “First of all, I am defending a person, not a crime,” Ovsyannikov said on Sunday on the eve of the verdict in the trial of the 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin, who has already pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian in late February. “I’m trying to prove that my defendant’s actions were misqualified. It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.”
“My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it. But there are other people who ‘invited’ me to go to Moscow or Donbas [the area in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia-backed separatists].”
Prosecutors were astonished on Friday when Ovsyannikov asked judges in the courtroom in Kyiv to acquit Shishimarin despite his guilty plea, on the grounds that he had executed an order. The Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order and therefore did not protect Shishimarin from responsibility.
Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines.
Shishimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk, in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia, and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on 28 February, the day that 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died in Chupakhivka village.
Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone a few dozen metres from his home. One of the men in the car told Shishimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window and shot down Shelipov.
This is not Ovsyannikov’s first controversial trial. In 2014 he defended the Russia-backed former president Viktor Yanukovych, who was eventually found guilty of high treason and sentenced in absentia to 13 years in prison over attempts to quash a pro-western uprising.
Ovsyannikov argues that ever since he accepted the task of defending Shishimarin, people have asked him the same question: “How can you defend a war criminal?”
“And I am so tired of explaining that, in Ukraine, only a court of law can recognise one as a criminal. And, as far as I know, there is no verdict for my defendant at the moment.”
The trial is unprecedented in Ukraine, where authorities are moving fast and trying to carry out justice while conflict is ongoing. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases for war crimes trials. Monday’s verdict is being seen as a public test of the independence of Ukraine’s judicial system.
“Of course, it is quite an important test and there is even stronger pressure from society on the judges to find him guilty,” said Ovsyannikov.
“My first impression of Shishimarin was of an ordinary person, just like you or me,” he said. “My second impression, when I started to work with him, is that he began to understand what had done. The only thing he desires now is to go back home. I am under this impression that he perceives this as some kind of a dream.”
“Sometimes,” he added, “I feel pity for him.”
This article was amended on 23 May 2022 to change the spelling of Vadim Shishimarin to put into Guardian style."

A Ukrainian man who converted almost all his family’s money into the crypto “stablecoin” terra in April in an effort to protect against the risks of invasion or currency collapse has lost almost $10,000 (£8,000) after its sudden demise.
“It was impossible and unsafe to store funds in the form of banknotes,” said Yuri Popovich, who lives in Kyiv. Cryptocurrencies advertised as safe and “backed with fiat currency” suggested another option.
Unlike most cryptocurrency purchases, buying a stablecoin isn’t intended to be a risky investment. The tokens, with names such as “terra”, “tether” and “USD coin”, are supposed to maintain a fixed value of one token to one US dollar. “I am not a speculator; I just wanted to save money,” Popovich said.
But when terra collapsed in early May, as well as sparking a broader meltdown in the cryptocurrency sector, it wiped out the savings of retail investors. “I stopped sleeping normally, lost 4kg; I often have headaches and anxiety,” Popovich said. “My wife still doesn’t know about this loss. I don’t know how to tell her.”
His savings, according to a screenshot seen by the Guardian, are now worth less than $500. “This is a colossal amount for us, and in the current situation it is critically important for life. I fear for my wife’s health, my health and our relationship. I don’t even know how it will end.”
Popovich is one an unknown number of retail investors who lost money in the collapse of terra, which at one point had almost $50bn invested in it and is now worth barely $1bn. As well as those looking for a safe place to keep their funds, others were lured in by the promise of interest rates topping 20% a year, in a currency that was theoretically pegged to the dollar.
But the interest rates, and ultimately the stability of the currency itself, relied on the continued interest of investors. That property led many to accuse terra, and other similar tokens, of effectively being a Ponzi scheme."

Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. In Mykolaiv, in the south, Russian rockets reportedly struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka.
Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. Russia is deploying Terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said.
Severodonetsk has been attacked from “four separate directions”, said the region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking the export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports.
Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said: “Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you.” Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion.
Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to its fellow EU member Estonia.
Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Zelenskiy said: “Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.”"

Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe.
Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the crude explosive, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military.
Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European warnings that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing.
Barrel bombs – crude explosives packed in to a drum and dropped from a helicopter – were used to devastating effect throughout the Syrian war. The regime was also regularly accused of filling canisters with chlorine and dropping them on opposition held towns and cities, causing hundreds of deaths and sparking widespread alarm.
With no anti-aircraft weapons, the anti-Assad opposition had little to counter the Syrian military’s air supremacy, which was a big factor in the regime clawing back parts of the country after 10 years of war.
The situation is very different in Ukraine, however, where Ukrainian troops armed with lethal ground to air missiles can bring down Russian jets and helicopters, stalling advances and exposing ground forces to withering artillery fire.
“This is probably why we haven’t seen them cross the border,” said one European official. “We know the capacity is there, but if they use it, they lose; we will know who’s done it, and they will likely be killed anyway.”
The barrel bomb specialists were at the vanguard of the forces the Syrian government sent to Russia to support Putin, whose backing had been instrumental in securing Assad regime’s grip on power.
The officials believe between 800 and 1,000 Syrian troops have so far volunteered to travel to Russia, where the Kremlin has promised them salaries of between $1,500-$4,000 – up to 20 times the amounts they would receive in Syria, where an economic collapse has ravaged the local currency’s value.
The Syrian government has established four main recruiting centres for the Russian deployment, in Damascus, Latakia, Hama and Homs. Recruits are deployed under contract with the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organisation, which has played a leading role in hiring mercenaries to support Russia’s foreign adventures.
Wagner has been prominent in Libya and eastern Syria supporting Russia’s interests. However, it has sometimes had a frayed relationship with the Kremlin. In early 2018, its forces were engaged in a brutal battle with US and Kurdish forces in the Syrian province of Deir Azzour, in which more than 140 mercenaries were killed, mainly by US artillery. European officials say that the Russian government had given a green light for the attack.
“It seems they had gotten too big for their boots,” an official said. “We know for a fact that the Kremlin cut them loose.”
Ever since though, Wagner has been central to Russia’s actions. Its forces were among the first deployed into Ukraine and are accused of committing atrocities in Bucha, where up to 1,000 people were massacred over a few days in early April.
A relative of a Syrian army lieutenant who signed up to fight in Ukraine denied his uncle was a mercenary. “They are going there as a regular army unit,” he said. “He is traveling with a full platoon. Only four of them didn’t want to go. Putin did a lot for us, and we can help him now.”
In late April, the Ukrainian government claimed that up to 25 Libyan or Syrian fighters had been killed in the town of Popasna, though this was denied by both Syrian officials and opposition members.
“I asked my uncle that,” said the relative who refused to be named. “He said it’s not them, but it might be Libyans. He insists that not one of them has crossed the border.”
Wagner is thought to have deployed up to 500 men as reconnaissance elements in Ukraine. Many have been flown in from hotspots around north and central Africa."
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/22/youtube-ukraine-invasion-russia-video-removals;2022-05-22;YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war;"Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.
The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion.
Since the conflict began in February, YouTube has taken down channels including that of the pro-Kremlin journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Channels associated with Russia’s Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs have also been temporarily suspended from uploading videos in recent months for describing the war as a “liberation mission”.
YouTube’s chief product officer, Neal Mohan, said: “We have a major violent events policy and that applies to things like denial of major violent events: everything from the Holocaust to Sandy Hook. And of course, what’s happening in Ukraine is a major violent event. And so we’ve used that policy to take unprecedented action.”
In an interview with the Guardian, Mohan added that YouTube’s news content on the conflict had received more than 40m views in Ukraine alone.
“The first and probably most paramount responsibility is making sure that people who are looking for information about this event can get accurate, high-quality, credible information on YouTube,” he said. “The consumption of authoritative channels on our platform has grown significantly, of course in Ukraine, but also in countries surrounding Ukraine, Poland, and also within Russia itself.”
YouTube did not provide a breakdown of the taken-down content and channels but Mohan said much of it represented Kremlin narratives about the invasion. “I don’t have the specific numbers, but you can imagine a lot of it being the narratives that are coming from Russian government, or Russian actors on behalf of the Russian government,” he said.
YouTube has an estimated 90 million users in Russia, although it no longer allows advertising on the platform in the country. The decision by YouTube’s parent company, Google, has drawn protests from Navalny, who said well-targeted ads helped counteract Kremlin propaganda.
“YouTube remains the largest video-sharing site up and running in Russia itself,” said Mohan. “So YouTube is a place where Russian citizens can get uncensored information about the war, including from many of the same authoritative channels that we all have access to outside of the country. We remain an important platform for Russian citizens themselves as this crisis continues to evolve.”
Last week, the Russian minister for digital development, Maksut Shadaev, said the country would not block YouTube, despite disputes over content that have resulted in the platform being fined in court for not removing banned videos.
Shadaev indicated that blocking Russia’s most popular social media platform would affect users. “We are not planning to close YouTube,” the minister said. “Above all, when we restrict something, we should clearly understand that our users won’t suffer.”
YouTube has also placed a worldwide ban on channels associated with Russian state media, including Russia Today and Sputnik. Facebook and Instagram are banned in Russia and access to Twitter has been restricted, in response to the platforms’ own bans on Russian state-owned media."

All my life, the widely shared assumption has been that there will always be food to buy – albeit at a price. No more. Suddenly, Russia’s successful blockade of Ukraine, choking off its crucially important exports of grain and oilseeds, has challenged all that. The west is right to hail Ukraine’s remarkable achievements on the battlefield – but Russia holds cards in this war that may yet prove to its decisive advantage. When the UN secretary-general warns of the spectre of a world food shortage, take notice. Equally, the governor of the Bank of England has been much derided for warning of a food apocalypse: he may choose his words clumsily, but he is right.
What is provoking these warnings is that there is no way to replace Ukrainian grain exports, which constitute 9% of the world’s, made worse by the decline in Russia’s grain exports. Only a fraction of Ukraine’s cereal harvests can find their way into global markets via road or through ports in Romania – and Russia has no intention of lifting its blockade while it faces sanctions that may last years, given the stalemate in Ukraine.
The price of grain is thus certain to rise – it is already 59% higher than in January – reflecting that there is less to go around. Those who can’t pay will simply go without, raising the prospect of famine spreading to hundreds of millions in poorer countries and a new flood of refugees.
Nor will Britain be unaffected, although it is largely self-sufficient in grain. Overall, we rely on imports to meet around half our food demands. All over the world, countries facing shortages of grain and other foodstuffs are simply halting their food exports; already, 22 countries have prohibited 10% of all food trade. Our four major food suppliers are our EU neighbours and former partners, now all too often turned into enemies: France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany.
Yet, just at this moment the Johnson government, with its habitual reckless incompetence and obsessive hatred of all things EU related, is prepared to risk an EU trade war by unilaterally abrogating the Brexit treaty. The UK may not want to damage crucial EU food imports, already deferring any regulatory checks until the end of next year. But why should EU member states play ball with a country whose leader they regard as a deceitful clown in hock to the worst of his party’s right, who never loses the chance to criticise the common agricultural policy (CAP), built to ensure European food security?
Suddenly the CAP looks like a strategic asset, with the EU recently moving to strengthen its farmers’ productive capacity and self-sufficiency in ways wholly at odds with Britain’s disdainful neglect of its own farmers. The EU may decide in response to Britain’s provocation that EU food security is of paramount importance, directing food exports only to where there is more need than Britain – for example, increasing its already hefty food support to Ukraine – or just making haulage and shipping regulatory requirements even tougher. They can do so, secure that EU producers can sell their food elsewhere, so creating food shortages in Britain.
If the EU does not wish to go so far, it has other effective levers to make Boris Johnson back down. Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of fertilisers, whose price has now soared 300% following the west’s trade sanctions. The UK produces only two-fifths of the fertiliser our farmers need, the balance imported mainly from the EU, Germany in particular.
Fertiliser and chemical production is an area where Brexit UK sees “opportunity” in diverging from EU single market rules that assure high product and safety standards, and is a key import into Northern Ireland. The EU has only to suspend or curtail EU fertiliser exports to Britain, concerned about our desire to weaken those rules, to crucify British agricultural production, which is already reeling from sky-high feed and fuel costs.
We are so badly governed by ministers and a party living in a sealed right-wing bubble that food rationing in 2023 is a real risk. More Brexit voters might think they were lied to. The larger point is that confidence over the past 30 years that globalisation was here to stay has led to the world’s food production and distribution system becoming profoundly interdependent, concentrated in a few countries and a few powerful agribusiness companies. As my colleague George Monbiot argues in his powerful book Regenesis, the system has become ever more market-based and less resilient, with some countries, notably Britain, assuming that there was no need for wasteful things like storage facilities, food reserves or ensuring strong domestic environmentally sustainable production.
Food, animal feed and fertilisers would flow seamlessly through safe international supply chains: domestic farmers’ margins could be squeezed to the bone. “Global” Britain could take this one step further, throwing off the crippling “shackles” of the CAP and buying cheap food from wherever, careless of UK farmers, quality food and the environment – hence the absurd trade deal dramatically favouring Australian farm producers over British ones, one of foreign secretary Liz Truss’s proudest achievements to please the Brexit right.
Today the whole intellectual edifice looks profoundly stupid – even dangerous. Resilience and sustainability in food production and distribution, along with ensuring everyone can afford to eat a healthy diet, constitute a foundational building block in our civilisation – even if mocked by Tory backbenchers and undermined by Brexiters.
Last week’s rise in inflation to 9% was driven by uncapped energy bills and escalating food prices. Britain’s inflation rate – the highest in the G7 – is because we have the least resilient, most market-based system for delivering key goods and services, and we are not a member of one of the big blocs partly able to protect itself from worldwide trends. We are a cork being thrown helplessly around the global ocean.
The curtain is finally coming down on the great Thatcherite experiment. The tragic pity is that so many millions are going to find out the hardest way – through eating crap food or, worse, going hungry – just how wrong-headed their leaders have been.

The west is right to hail Ukraine’s remarkable achievements on the battlefield – but Russia holds cards in this war that may yet prove to its decisive advantage. When the UN secretary-general warns of the spectre of a world food shortage, take notice. Equally, the governor of the Bank of England has been much derided for warning of a food apocalypse: he may choose his words clumsily, but he is right.
What is provoking these warnings is that there is no way to replace Ukrainian grain exports, which constitute 9% of the world’s, made worse by the decline in Russia’s grain exports. Only a fraction of Ukraine’s cereal harvests can find their way into global markets via road or through ports in Romania – and Russia has no intention of lifting its blockade while it faces sanctions that may last years, given the stalemate in Ukraine.
The price of grain is thus certain to rise – it is already 59% higher than in January – reflecting that there is less to go around. Those who can’t pay will simply go without, raising the prospect of famine spreading to hundreds of millions in poorer countries and a new flood of refugees.
Nor will Britain be unaffected, although it is largely self-sufficient in grain. Overall, we rely on imports to meet around half our food demands. All over the world, countries facing shortages of grain and other foodstuffs are simply halting their food exports; already, 22 countries have prohibited 10% of all food trade. Our four major food suppliers are our EU neighbours and former partners, now all too often turned into enemies: France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany.
Yet, just at this moment the Johnson government, with its habitual reckless incompetence and obsessive hatred of all things EU related, is prepared to risk an EU trade war by unilaterally abrogating the Brexit treaty. The UK may not want to damage crucial EU food imports, already deferring any regulatory checks until the end of next year. But why should EU member states play ball with a country whose leader they regard as a deceitful clown in hock to the worst of his party’s right, who never loses the chance to criticise the common agricultural policy (CAP), built to ensure European food security?
Suddenly the CAP looks like a strategic asset, with the EU recently moving to strengthen its farmers’ productive capacity and self-sufficiency in ways wholly at odds with Britain’s disdainful neglect of its own farmers. The EU may decide in response to Britain’s provocation that EU food security is of paramount importance, directing food exports only to where there is more need than Britain – for example, increasing its already hefty food support to Ukraine – or just making haulage and shipping regulatory requirements even tougher. They can do so, secure that EU producers can sell their food elsewhere, so creating food shortages in Britain.
If the EU does not wish to go so far, it has other effective levers to make Boris Johnson back down. Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of fertilisers, whose price has now soared 300% following the west’s trade sanctions. The UK produces only two-fifths of the fertiliser our farmers need, the balance imported mainly from the EU, Germany in particular.
Fertiliser and chemical production is an area where Brexit UK sees “opportunity” in diverging from EU single market rules that assure high product and safety standards, and is a key import into Northern Ireland. The EU has only to suspend or curtail EU fertiliser exports to Britain, concerned about our desire to weaken those rules, to crucify British agricultural production, which is already reeling from sky-high feed and fuel costs.
We are so badly governed by ministers and a party living in a sealed right-wing bubble that food rationing in 2023 is a real risk. More Brexit voters might think they were lied to. The larger point is that confidence over the past 30 years that globalisation was here to stay has led to the world’s food production and distribution system becoming profoundly interdependent, concentrated in a few countries and a few powerful agribusiness companies. As my colleague George Monbiot argues in his powerful book Regenesis, the system has become ever more market-based and less resilient, with some countries, notably Britain, assuming that there was no need for wasteful things like storage facilities, food reserves or ensuring strong domestic environmentally sustainable production.
Food, animal feed and fertilisers would flow seamlessly through safe international supply chains: domestic farmers’ margins could be squeezed to the bone. “Global” Britain could take this one step further, throwing off the crippling “shackles” of the CAP and buying cheap food from wherever, careless of UK farmers, quality food and the environment – hence the absurd trade deal dramatically favouring Australian farm producers over British ones, one of foreign secretary Liz Truss’s proudest achievements to please the Brexit right.
Today the whole intellectual edifice looks profoundly stupid – even dangerous. Resilience and sustainability in food production and distribution, along with ensuring everyone can afford to eat a healthy diet, constitute a foundational building block in our civilisation – even if mocked by Tory backbenchers and undermined by Brexiters.
Last week’s rise in inflation to 9% was driven by uncapped energy bills and escalating food prices. Britain’s inflation rate – the highest in the G7 – is because we have the least resilient, most market-based system for delivering key goods and services, and we are not a member of one of the big blocs partly able to protect itself from worldwide trends. We are a cork being thrown helplessly around the global ocean.
The curtain is finally coming down on the great Thatcherite experiment. The tragic pity is that so many millions are going to find out the hardest way – through eating crap food or, worse, going hungry – just how wrong-headed their leaders have been.

It is a 10-minute drive from Serhi Belyaev’s house in the village of Tsyrkuny to his fiancee’s home in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. A quick spin west on Soborna Street, over the E40 motorway on to the Lesia Serduika highway, and you are there. That was, until the war came.
It took just hours for Russian forces to sweep into Belyaev’s village on 24 February, as they advanced on Kharkiv, the closest major Ukrainian city to the Russian border.
Lives across Ukraine were changed that morning. For Belyaev, the frontline of the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war now lay between him and both his girlfriend, Nataliy Drozd, 28, and his parents.
No longer the familiar road into town, Lesia Serduika was now an impassable no man’s land. Belyaev was cut off, worried for his sick mother, Galina, 66, and determined to be with his terrified girlfriend.
Then Belyaev, 32, a professional poker player, had an idea. A gamble. He mused on it, initially rejected it and then settled on it. He would replace the 10km drive with a 3,700km odyssey.
“To the Russian border, through Russia to Latvia, on to Lithuania and Poland and then back into western Ukraine to come at Kharkiv from the west,” he says. “It was a bit crazy, yes.” But it was possible.
What followed was an extraordinary adventure that brought Belyaev to the attention of the Kremlin’s secret police, the FSB, who rightly suspected him of giving away Russian positions to the Ukrainian army. He traversed cities under fire, driving in against the flow of refugees, and there were, he admits, moments of doubt. “But only briefly: I had to get to my fiancee.”
In the first days of the war, Belyaev and his brother Yuri, 45, fled Tsyrkuny, which was in flames, for Strilecha, a village a short way north that was occupied but not under fire.
Belyaev started talking to families who wanted to get to Poland. He decided he would join a convoy of four cars in his black Honda Accord. “The car needed repairs to the brakes and the transmission,” he recalls. “It made terrible noises, but there was no other option.”
Yuri, who has a heart condition, chose to stay behind to look after their dog. His place in the car was taken by two strangers: Emil, 28, and Emil’s fiancee, Katya, 22. On 4 April at 1pm they set off. It was a jittery start.
“We had been told by Russian soldiers the border, a kilometre away, would be open. But it wasn’t,” Belyaev recalls. The only viable option was to drive 70km through occupied land to a second border crossing. “That 70km was the hardest,” says Belyaev. “There were lots of checkpoints and, halfway there, we came to some Russian soldiers who wouldn’t let us through.”
The convoy was turned round. They were directed by the soldiers towards what they would soon discover was a filtration camp in a local administrative building. Their lives were on the line. “We were all interrogated. They were very suspicious of Emil, who was from Luhansk in the east and didn’t have a passport as it had been burned at the start of the war. His phone was also broken because of the humidity in the cellar where he had hidden from the bombardments.”
Emil was undressed to his underwear so they could search for tattoos that might offer evidence of a military affiliation. Then they went through Belyaev’s phone. “I had deleted everything,” he says. “If I hadn’t, I would be dead. I didn’t sit with my hands in my pockets when the war began. I sent locations of Russian military convoys to friends in the territorial defence.”
But the group were finally handed the documents they needed at 4pm on the first day of the journey. A 5pm Russian curfew was looming. Those breaking it were liable to be shot.
Belyaev put his foot down, unsure whether he was on the right road as there was no data coverage, no road signs and they were on dirt tracks. “We had to cross a bridge at the village of Rubizhne. I saw it being built when I was 10 when my brother took me fishing,” Belyaev says. Now it was in ruins. “I saw its birth and I saw its death,” he adds. There was just one lane still standing. “It wouldn’t take much weight,” Belyaev says. “I was terrified at that point. It was a 20-metre drop to the river below.”
But they made it – and at the next checkpoint, the convoy of cars was waved through. The mood of the group lifted. But disaster struck. One of the drivers had got overexcited. “He was driving a bit faster – and he hit a pot hole hard.” The car’s front wheels were badly damaged and there was no way it could complete the journey. They drove to the closest city, Vovchansk, with a heavy heart. “But again pure luck,” says Belyaev. “The first person I asked about where a garage might be said he was a mechanic. He repaired the car so quickly that we could get going immediately.”
It was now 7pm and the border was due to close at 8pm. But the mechanic was confident they would get through. “We went but there was no electricity, so it was pitch black,” Belyaev recalls. “I was the lead car. Then, out of nowhere, right in front of me, was a soldier with a machine gun. We were at the border.”
It took five hours to get across after a thorough questioning. “And then we decided to turn right – I don’t know why because it was the wrong way,” says Belyaev. The soldiers blinked the lights on their military vehicles. They had their machine guns out and were now suspicious and aggressive.
“We explained that we didn’t know the way.” The soldiers conferred. “But they accepted it and waved us on.”
As the convoy went on its way, Emil joked, “What do we need to do to get shot?” But now, at 3am on the second day, they were in Putin’s Russia. “I sent a text to Nataliy telling her where I was, just saying that it was safer there,” says Belyaev. “She was actually angry because I had left the dog behind. I didn’t tell her about my plan to come back in. I was worried my communications would be intercepted.”
The convoy drove on, heading to Belgorod, the closest big Russian city. Almost immediately they were waved down again. It was the FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB. “Every single one of us was interrogated again,” says Belyaev. “But I knew my phone was clean. They asked me about my job. We must have spent 20 minutes talking about poker.”
They reached Belgorod around 5am, where they slept in their cars outside a supermarket. “But this was enemy territory. We knew we had to sleep less and drive more.” They were up again two hours later. Belyaev played music on his phone. The soundtrack, Belyaev laughs, was Gwen Stefani, Jay-Z and Limp Bizkit.
Their trip then took them through Kursk, Roslavl, Smolensk and Velikiye Luki, where they arrived at 5am on the second day, to snatch some sleep. Exhausted, they finally reached the Ubylinka border crossing into Latvia at 10am the following day, 6 April.
It took 16 hours to get through border control. “But it was such a relief,” recalls Belyaev. “I felt I was a man with rights again. I called Nataliy and my parents and told her about my real plans. Nataliy said, ‘You have a chance to stay in safety. You should stay there because men between 18 and 60 aren’t allowed to leave Ukraine. We can be together when the war ends’.”
Belyaev had no time to think. It was 2am and they were facing a 1,000km journey to Poland via Latvia. At midday they stopped at Kaunas in southern Lithuania. “This was the first wifi – in McDonald’s. I called my friends and parents. ‘I am eating McDonald’s. How about you?’,” he laughs.
The convoy headed off again, this time to Warsaw, arriving at 7pm. His fellow travellers had reached their destination: a large expo hall turned into a refugee centre. Belyaev had to make a decision. He pondered during a seven-day stay in Warsaw. The risks seemed grave. He was also sick with Covid symptoms and getting worse. But he felt he had to go on. “I told Nataliy that I wanted to come back. I said, ‘Wait for me, baby’.”
On 14 April, at 2pm, Belyaev left Warsaw for the Rava-Ruska border, joining a humanitarian convoy. They reached Lviv, Ukraine’s most westerly city, at midnight, loaded up some supplies, and set off. This was wartime Ukraine: every road posed a risk.
“A lot of roads were closed – it added probably 100km to our 550km journey. But it is nothing when you are driving 3,700km rather than 10km to get home,” laughs Belyaev.
He reached Kyiv at noon on 15 April and slept at a friend’s – in a bed for the first time in 11 days. On the morning of 18 April, he left Kyiv for Poltava, a city halfway to his destination, where his younger brother lived. “It was the first time I had driven alone,” says Belyaev. “I found it hard.” In Poltava, he picked up medicines for his parents and he was now en route to the very frontline of the war in Ukraine, where his village remained cut off and the battle of Kharkiv raged. But Belyaev had no doubts. It was perhaps even time for a little surprise.
“I rang my dad and told him a volunteer was near with supplies, so he should come down,” Belyaev smiles. “And he found me.” The men hugged. With his mum, tears flowed. Then, just 50 metres from Nataliy’s house, he was stopped by police. “They were suspicious of the blankets and the state of my car. They asked if I had been sleeping in it, and why. It was only my passport stamps that persuaded them of my story.”
Finally he was, however, back with the woman he loved. Had Belyaev made the right decision to head back? Nataliy smiles: “Home is home.”"

Ministers have been accused of choosing the “worst moment in history” to slash the foreign aid budget, as provisional figures showed that UK overseas humanitarian funding was cut by more than half last year.
MPs and charity campaigners say the aid budget urgently needs to be increased to cope with the Ukraine conflict and the risk of famine in Africa. Up to 23 million people face acute hunger in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia due to drought.
The UN has warned the Ukraine crisis risks tipping 1.7 billion people – one-fifth of the global population – into poverty, destitution and hunger. The government said last week it now intends to boost humanitarian aid by giving less money to international organisations and focusing on direct aid from the UK.
Western officials reportedly fear that Vladimir Putin is “weaponising” global food supplies. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of the world’s wheat and barley exports.
Sarah Champion MP, Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, said: “It would be hard to consider a worse moment in history for the government to be cutting its foreign aid budget.
“We are the only member of the rich country G7 grouping to be doing so. It is having a damaging effect on our international standing – and the survival chances of some of the poorest people on the planet.”
Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a controversial reduction of aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income in November 2020.
UK direct humanitarian aid to foreign countries was £744m last year, compared with £1.53bn in 2020, a cut of 51%, according to the most recent provisional UK aid figures. UK official development assistance was nearly £11.5bn last year, compared with £14.48bn in 2020, a fall of 21%.
Separate figures published in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) annual report last year revealed direct UK aid and planned aid to Ethiopia fell from £241m in 2020/21 to £108m in 2021/22, a cut of 55%; aid to Kenya fell from £67m to £41m, a cut of 39%; and aid to Somalia fell from £121m to £71m, a cut of 41%.
One of the largest global humanitarian crises is in Yemen, devastated by eight years of civil war. About 24 million people need help, including nearly 13 million children. UK aid to Yemen fell from £221m 2020/21 to £82m in 2021/22, a cut of 63%.
Sam Nadel, Oxfam’s head of government relations, said: “The government is cutting aid at a time we have war in Ukraine, the Covid pandemic and millions of people in Africa on the brink of starvation. It’s the most horrific timing. It’s also shortsighted because aid helps tackle global challenges, which helps the UK in the long term.”
Ministers have announced £220m in humanitarian and development aid for Ukraine, putting more pressure on the reduced UK aid budget.
Kate Munro, head of advocacy at charity Action Against Hunger, said aid funding needed to return to 0.7% of GNI and ministers should urgently announce a new aid package for the millions of people facing starvation in east Africa. “It saves money to act early in a crisis,” she said.
The charity will attend an event in parliament this week to campaign for more aid for east Africa. It is calling for a funding commitment from the government of £750m, similar to the amount provided in 2017 when east Africa was also hit by drought and widespread famine was averted.
Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, last week announced a new international development strategy, with aid targeted to help deliver the UK’s foreign policy objectives. More money will be spent on direct aid from the UK, rather than internationally.
Champion last week described the new strategy as a “rehash of existing slogans’, but welcomed its focus on women and girls. She said a policy of “aid for trade” was dangerous and could distort the core purpose of international assistance to support the poor and most vulnerable.
The FCDO said: “Stepping up our life-saving humanitarian work to prevent the worst forms of human suffering around the world is one of the top priorities the foreign secretary laid out in the UK’s international development strategy this week.
“We will prioritise humanitarian funding levels at £3bn over the next three years, to remain a global leader in crisis response, including in Africa.”"

Ukrainian forces have built a new line of defences along the country’s previously unfortified northern border with Belarus amid signs of another attack.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv.
On 10 May, Belarus’s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a “southern threat” from Ukraine and Nato. Belarus has been conducting military drills on its border with Ukraine since early May.
The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has been Russia’s closest ally in its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Lukashenko urged the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, which met in Moscow, to remain united on Ukraine and accused the west of prolonging the conflict.
The Guardian was given access to Ukraine’s border positions on the condition that it did not disclose the exact locations or the surnames of the Ukrainians serving.
In the forests along the Belarusian border, a Ukrainian territorial defence unit made up of fighters between the ages of 19 and the mid-60s, is manning a network of trenches and positions constructed since the February invasion.
Before February, much of Ukraine’s border with Belarus consisted of small kiosk-like checkpoints which Russian tanks broke through with ease. Two days after the invasion, Ukraine closed all its border crossings with Belarus and Russia.
In their analysis of the threat from Belarus, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said last week that the presence of Belarusian forces on the border would probably prevent Ukraine from deploying support operations on its Donbas front.
Armed with AK47s and a few dozen men per position, the fighters hope the Belarusian border will not be used by invading forces again.
“We’ll be in the frying pan,” joked Vova, a man who volunteered to fight in the Donbas in 2014 and was in the Soviet army. Vova signed up to fight alongside his brother, Ihor, and his brother’s son, Maksym, on the second day of the war.
“They took the first 500 men in the queue that day, but there were over 800 of us,” said Ihor, sat between his brother and son at the makeshift barracks near the border.
“I’ve got hypertension, he’s got hypertension, he’s on insulin,” said Ihor, pointing around the room at the middle-aged and pension-aged men. “And then the other part of the unit is younger guys like Maksym.”
Ihor and Maksym were working on a construction site in Kyiv on the morning of the invasion. They rushed back to the Zhytomyr region, where their family live, to sign up. Territorial defence units in Ukraine are made up of people who fight in the same region as where they live.
The men and a few women in the unit said some of them knew each other from before the war. In almost every other case, there is only a few degrees of separation.
“In some cases, it was like, ‘Oh, your grandmother knows my grandfather, maybe we’re brothers’,” said Ihor, who added that fighting among people from his own region gave him a great sense of duty and motivation. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST
The unit said they do not have the back up of heavy artillery units, but that they were fortunate to have local geography on their side. The miles-long narrow roads that lead down from the border are surrounded by thick forests which cover the deep, swampy ground.
“No one has ever managed to hold this territory for that reason,” said Ihor, the unit’s military press secretary, speaking about battles around the northern border during the second world war."

Play the “what if” history game and it is easy to see the west betraying the people of Ukraine. What if Donald Trump had won the 2020 US presidential election? You do not need to go back and read of his envious admiration of Vladimir Putin and every other quasi and actual dictator, when he is currently condemning the Biden administration for sending $40bn to Ukraine instead of putting America First.
What if Jeremy Corbyn had won the 2019 UK general election? We do not need to remember his appeasement of Putin after Russia’s nerve agent attack in Salisbury now that the great anti-imperialist has decided that a war of colonial aggrandisement by Europe’s last empire is exactly the right moment to say that he wishes to see Nato “ultimately disbanded”.
And what if Dominic Cummings still controlled Downing Street?
The answer takes us to the heart of a misreading of the past 30 years. The conventional wisdom holds that right and left were committed to liberal democracy and free markets. Their principled/complacent/ corrupt (delete according to taste) worldview was shattered by the arrival of strongman nationalist leaders in the 2010s, as if from nowhere.
Nothing comes from nowhere. The belief that democracy needs to be defended only when the system allows the right to win was there long before 2016. As was the contempt of reactionaries for liberal rights, and their conviction that the progressive elite was destroying the ethnic essence of the nation by cynically importing migrants who would vote for centre-left politicians. Resentment and paranoia stewed not only on the far right but in the supposedly elevated minds of Tory intellectuals, and pushed them ineluctably to authoritarian conclusions. As Cummings has been busy showing us.
The man who campaigned for Britain to take back control from the EU is arguing against Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state. He says the US and UK have “deliberately discouraged peace talks” – as if Putin has shown the smallest interest in withdrawing his forces. “Much of Ukraine is wrecked, thousands dead and hundreds of billions in damage,” he continues. Agreed, but who did the wrecking and killing? Cummings is too tongue-tied to say. He airbrushes away Russia’s responsibility for its crimes and then sinks lower by asserting that Russian propaganda contains more than a grain of truth. “Some” of the aid we send to Ukraine is “going to actual Nazis, as Putin claims”, Cummings opines. While actual mass murderers are indulged, Volodymyr Zelenskiy is denounced as a self-obsessed warmonger. He is “happy to escalate”. He has a “PT Barnum-feel for manipulating the media, and is loving it”.
If Cummings’s advice had been followed, no British anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles would have been sent to Kyiv, and the Ukrainian resistance would have felt their absence.
As it is, Cummings is reduced to showing us the smoulderings from the fag end of the British imperial mindset. Great powers can do as they please. We should not mention their unprovoked crimes against humanity, but acknowledge that they are right to say that, among the mounds of corpses they leave behind, are “actual Nazis”. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians and their ridiculous leader must stop escalating a conflict Russia imposed on them and accept that their fate is to submit.
Long before Trump, Conservatives were following the path that ends at the grim terminus of dictator worship. Leftwing critics of the last Labour government found it an insipid, Tory-lite affair. We would have understood it better if we had registered how fervently rightwing opinion hated Blairism. They no longer understood their country. The multiculturalism, the sexual tolerance and the very fact Labour was in power for 13 years induced disgust and a despairing willingness to embrace any white, Christian regime that proclaimed itself the enemy of liberalism. Cummings’s mentor at Oxford, Norman Stone, a decent historian until the drink did for him, ended his days penning apologias for Hungarian authoritarianism. Viktor Orbán was so impressed by the flattery that he attended Stone’s funeral. Roger Scruton, who is still regarded as a thoughtful philosopher among unthinking Conservatives, and Margaret Thatcher’s speech writer John O’Sullivan also bent the knee to Orbán in their old age. It is not only the Fox News wing of the American right that cannot decide whether it prefers Hungarian or Russian autocracy.
When they were friends, Cummings and Johnson had a fair crack at turning authoritarian theory into practice. They purged the Conservative party of critics, unlawfully suspended parliament and assaulted every independent institution that might check them. A serious government, said Cummings, was “not cowed by officials and their bullshit ‘legal advice’ ”. It could dispense with laws that stood in the way of a true Brexit.
As it turned out, Cummings was the bullshit that was dispensed with. Luckily for Ukrainians, Johnson fired him. Johnson himself is now as far from a strongman as it is possible to imagine: a bloated, enfeebled leader, in fear of his backbenchers and without an idea about how to cope with today’s crisis, he ricochets from one buffeting to the next like an overgrown child on a bouncy castle.
You can be relieved at our democracy’s escape until you examine the detail. The Tory party rebels against Johnson to stop the building of new homes or the imposition of anti-obesity measures but it never objects in sufficient numbers to the attacks on the BBC and Channel 4, or to the threats to the independence of the civil service, or to the freedom to protest, or to the Human Rights Act.
Conservatives resent comparisons between Johnson and Trump, let alone Johnson and Putin. But on one point there is equivalence. Johnson took Britain out of the EU as Putin invaded Ukraine, to assert national greatness. Both enterprises have been disastrous because neither leader had the smallest idea of how to make their adventurism work.
We are left with “what if” questions of our own. What if the next election sees voter suppression so endemic that two million are denied the franchise? What if a cowed BBC dare not challenge the ruling party? What if the failure of Brexit sends the Conservatives into a spiral of revanchism and stab-in-the-back conspiracism?
We don’t know the answers yet, only that our “what ifs” are not a game.

It is one of Britain’s most controversial property sales. A former multimillionaire banker warns that proceeds from the disposal of his £6.5m Kent country estate risk being sent to help fund Vladimir Putin’s war machine.
Ilya Yurov, 50, who is originally from Moscow, is being pursued with two former colleagues for $900m (£720m) from the National Bank Trust in Russia after losing a high court case.
National Bank Trust is tasked with recovering billions of pounds from around the world to send back to Russia, but to date has escaped the UK sanctions list. As revealed by the Observer last week, it is majority owned by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and was once promoted by the actor Bruce Willis.
Yurov bought Oxney Court in Kent, a 17th-century gothic-style mansion with crenellated walls and towers, in 2012. The property was destroyed by a blaze during the first world war when it was commandeered as an operation headquarters and place of recuperation for soldiers returning from the front. It was meticulously rebuilt in 1998. The 14-hectare (35-acre) estate, with tennis court and pool, has been put on the market for £6.5m to help pay his debt.
Speaking at the Grade II-listed building last week, he accepted that the property needed to be sold and money recovered, but said National Bank Trust should urgently be put on the sanctions list.
He said: “I can’t accept that this money can go back to the Russian state. I feel sick that it could be used to support horrible atrocities. The west can’t turn a blind eye to this. It’s illogical that the bank is not sanctioned.”
Yurov, a father of six, said the funds returned to the Russian state could be used to support the war. He said state-controlled banks were providing loans and finance for defence contractors in the face of global sanctions.
Ministers announced sanctions targeting the central bank in February, but face questions over concerns that National Bank Trust may be a conduit for funds going to Putin. The Foreign Office declined to comment last week.
The Observer understands lawyers in the case have said that National Bank Trust is not a sanctioned entity, so funds can be transferred.
Executives at National Bank Trust have said they are tasked with recovering £6bn of global assets by 2023. This includes debts such as those owed by Yurov and colleagues, Nikolay Fetisov, a former president of the bank, and Sergey Belyaev.
National Trust Bank alleges the three former shareholders fraudulently used offshore companies to conceal bad debts and extract millions of dollars. The bank had a state bailout after it collapsed in 2014.
Yurov and Fetisov said they properly used offshore companies to manage bad debts. Belyaev said he had no knowledge of the scheme.
The high court ruled in January 2020 that the three men owed the bank compensation. The judge ruled that the three former owners had evaded banking standards. He found Yurov to be a “dishonest and untruthful witness”. Yurov said he considered the judgment unfair, but has exhausted all avenues of appeal. He was bankrupted by the case.
Yurov’s family estate is in the name of his wife, Nataliya, but the court ruled that he owned half of the property. The trustees acting for Yurov’s creditors will be entitled to half of the estate when it is sold.
The main creditor is National Bank Trust, but trustees have said no transactions will occur with sanctioned entities, or their subsidiaries, without permission of the courts.
Russia tried to extradite Yurov in 2018, but the request was refused on the grounds that he would not get a fair trial. He was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison for organising theft of funds from a credit institution. He denies the charge."

There is not a country that has escaped the combined economic shocks of Covid-19 and the global spike in oil and food prices triggered by Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine. Painful for wealthy countries, for low- to middle-income countries it risks being existential. Sri Lanka – mired in crisis – last week defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history.
While its collapsing economy is as much a product of its corrupt politics as of global economic trends, Sri Lanka is also a worrying bellwether for the instability elsewhere that may be triggered by declining economic security in countries with high levels of poverty.
The situation facing Sri Lanka’s citizens is dire. Soaring inflation has taken the price of basic goods out of reach for many, and extreme shortages of food, medicine and fuel mean people have to spend hours queuing in the extreme heat while shops have been forced to close. For months, there have been peaceful anti-government protests, driven by anger with the political elite. But in recent weeks, they have turned violent; one politician has been killed by a mob, and others have had their houses set alight.
This crisis has been long in the making: the product of 20 years of unsustainable levels of borrowing to fund unwise projects, and levels of taxation that have been too low. This made Sri Lanka particularly vulnerable to the impact of Covid, including on its tourism industry. Additionally, the current administration cut taxes further just before the pandemic, and banned the import of chemical fertilisers in April 2021, which has had a ruinous impact on Sri Lanka’s domestic food production, making it even more reliant on expensive imports.
There are other countries where political turmoil and economic vulnerabilities mean that further economic shocks will lead to more hardship for their populations, with the risk of triggering instability and violence. Global food prices rose by more than 30% in 2021, and the war in Ukraine pushed up wheat and maize prices by almost 20% in the course of just one month this year. The economic impact of Covid, already bad, is far from over: lockdowns in Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Shenzen have disrupted supply chains worldwide.
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has reawakened western commitment to the Nato alliance as a way of promoting global security. But that is not enough: wealthy countries such as the US and the UK need to be alive to the impact of these global economic trends on lower- and middle-income countries, not just because they have a moral duty to do more to alleviate global poverty, but also out of self-interest with a view to security risks. Instead, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has cut £4.2bn from the British aid budget, breaking the Conservative manifesto pledge to keep aid spending at 0.7% of gross national income. Countries such as Syria, Bangladesh and South Sudan saw their aid from the UK reduced overnight by 69%, 62% and 49% respectively, and the UK has cut £1.5bn of aid from a World Bank programme focused on helping poorer countries recover from Covid. Last week, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, published a government white paper on international aid spending that proposes halving UK spending on multilateral agencies such as the UN and the World Bank to redirect aid spending towards the UK’s own trade interests.
Western retreat from international aid will leave more room for China to fill the gap. Lending to countries such as Sri Lanka through its “belt and road” infrastructure programme is a key part of China’s strategy to increase its soft power. In a world of increasing economic insecurity, Britain’s cuts to international aid are not just immoral, but short-sighted in the extreme.

Childcare issues and inflexible working hours are preventing Ukrainian women from getting jobs as they attempt to rebuild their lives in Britain. Ukrainian refugees told the Observer they were shocked to discover the cost and inaccessibility of childcare and after-school provision and that they were struggling to navigate the system.
For many, the problem is exacerbated by language issues – meaning they cannot access better-paid jobs, even if they are highly qualified.
With childcare unaffordable for many, Anya Abdulakh, a trustee of the charity Families4Peace, which is helping newly arrived Ukrainians in north London, said mothers are struggling to find work that fits around school hours. Abdulakh is trying to get childcare providers to offer free or reduced-cost places for Ukrainian children. In the long term, she said, government help is needed for the “thousands” of women she thinks will be affected.
Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, refugees are theoretically guaranteed free accommodation for six months, but many are worried about not having a job and enough money saved up for when they have to rent for themselves.
“So, being able to be employed is security that you can offer to your child going forward when you have to pay for the rent,” said Abdulakh. If they can’t, she added, some may be forced to go back to Ukraine, even if the war is continuing.
When she tried to help a beautician get free childcare for her two-year-old son so that she could work, she was told there was nothing until September. Another Ukrainian mother, Victoria Shcherbyna, 42, has been living in temporary accommodation for seven weeks in a village in Ukraine near the Hungarian border with her seven-year-old daughter, Sofia. They are waiting for their UK visas to be approved while her husband remains in Kyiv. Although she has a Homes for Ukraine host, and a job in sales, set up in London, she is becoming increasingly concerned about childcare.
She had hoped that Sofia would be able to attend a summer camp during the holidays at relatively low cost, like in Ukraine before the war. But after speaking to UK-based Ukrainian mothers, she realised that it would be unaffordable and finish too early in the day. “I have received many messages back like ‘This is the reality, you get used to it’,” she said. She is also concerned about after-school care. While she feels fearful and powerless, she is trying to make the process as stress-free as possible for Sofia, who she said “has seen enough”, by presenting their move as an adventure.
“There is not much I can do. I just need to adapt somehow and I have only one thought in my mind: that there is nothing that is impossible for me, that I have to cope with everything and find solutions because otherwise it won’t work.”
Through tears, she said at first she didn’t want to leave her husband and Ukraine, but that she must, for her children’s future. Her son Danylo, 19, is at Manchester University, so this way at least they will keep part of their family together.
Kateryna Chernyaeva, 43, arrived in London from Kyiv only last week with her son Dima, 12, and is now trying to find a school for him that also runs after-school clubs, to fit around her work. In Ukraine she worked as an HR director and is hoping to find work in the UK but, she said, “at the same time I need to know that my child, [for] the whole day, will be safe.”
“I left all of my life and family in Kyiv. It’s very hard to realise everything has changed,” she said. But she is determined to work out their new life in London. “I’m trying to adapt to a new life and I understand I have to start from scratch. I’m ready because I’m a strong person and, if I believe in myself, I’ll be OK. But at the same time I really want to see my parents, husband, brother.”
Meanwhile, community organisations said the hurdles faced by Ukrainian refugees – mainly women and children fleeing the Russian invasion alone as the family’s sole breadwinner, while most men are required to stay in the country – highlight the existing systemic issues in childcare provision for all families across the UK. They also accused the government of leaning too heavily on the voluntary sector to help newly arrived Ukrainians, and called for more funding to help the charities and organisations that were attempting to fill in the gaps.
Iryna Terlecky, head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Great Britain, said that the difficulties faced by Ukrainians, “to a huge extent have highlighted some of the systemic issues there are for childcare and children’s activities – not only for smaller children but also for older children and teenagers”.
The Local Government Association said access to good quality childcare was vital and called on the government to significantly increase funding.
A government spokesperson said: “All children and young people living in the UK have a right to access education and childcare, including those from Ukraine, and ministers have been clear that supporting families is a priority.
“We have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver free childcare offers, and are working across government to look for more ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare places. We have also legislated for the right to flexible working, and shared parental leave and pay, to better support eligible working parents.”"

The lights dimmed, a hush came over the auditorium and the orchestra struck up the first notes of the overture. This ritual has taken place thousands of times at Kyiv’s grand opera house over the past century, but the performance on Saturday afternoon was something out of the ordinary.
In a city that over the past three months became used to wailing air-raid sirens and the thuds of artillery from the suburbs, the audience was instead treated to the frothy melodies of Rossini’s The Barber of Seville.
It marked the first performance since the missiles and shells of Vladimir Putin’s invasion rudely interrupted the opera season – and everything else in Ukraine – in the early hours of 24 February.
Now, less than three months later and with fierce battles still raging in the eastern part of the country, the opera is back, although with some changes. Performances will only take place on weekend afternoons, a maximum of 300 tickets are sold, and the audience has to be ready to move quickly to the basement cloakrooms if air-raid sirens sound during a performance.
Saturday’s audience was a mix of couples enjoying their first opportunity for weeks to wear their most elegant outfits, and soldiers in military fatigues taking a break from their army service for some high culture.
Only the stalls were full, with the four tiers of gilded balconies off-limits to ensure an evacuation could take place more quickly if needed.
“I can’t say opera is my usual entertainment, but it is an incredible feeling to hear this music and to be in a different world for a little while, before coming back to our reality,” said Volodymyr, a soldier who only wanted to give his first name.
Many of the opera troupe are still abroad, and some in the orchestra are fighting on the frontline or serving in the territorial defence forces.
Oleksii Potiomkin, the principal dancer of the ballet, has joined up and is serving in the army, posting daily updates on Instagram.
But enough artists and technical staff are back at work for the company to put on full-scale opera stagings.
Soprano Olha Fomichova, who sang the lead role of Rosina on Saturday, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke of her emotions before going on stage.
“I had the feeling this morning that I was coming to sing a premiere, even though I have been singing this role for years. I feel like I’m coming out on to this stage, which I know so well, for the first time,” she said.
Fomichova mostly stayed in Kyiv during the invasion but sent her son to safety in Germany. She saw him recently when she travelled there to take part in a charity gala to help Ukraine, and both the family reunion and the concert were emotional, she said.
“When you take a Ukrainian flag on to the stage for the curtain call and you are met with a 10-minute standing ovation, I don’t have words to describe the feeling,” she said.
Over the past three months, the soloists have kept in touch in a chat group on Viber, swapping stories about how the war was going for them, said Natalia Nykolaishyn, a soprano who has been at the theatre for 20 years.
“We were all very close before, but now we feel like family,” she said. On Sunday, Nykolaishyn will sing the lead role in the opera  Natalka Poltavka by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko.
“We wanted to open with symbolic performances: first a European classic and then a Ukrainian classic,” said culture minister Oleksandr Tkachenko, who attended Saturday’s performance.
Kyiv’s opera house has seen a lot over the years, on and off the stage. Opened in 1901 after a fire destroyed the previous building, a decade later it was the scene of a dramatic assassination.
Prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, attending a Rimsky-Korsakov opera with Tsar Nicholas II, was shot dead during the interval while standing in the front row of the stalls.
The pause in performances during the Russian invasion is only the third lengthy gap in activity over the past century, said the theatre’s archivist Larisa Tarasenko.
The first was between the end of the Nazi occupation and the return of the evacuated Soviet troupe. The second was due to Covid. Otherwise, performances continued even as regimes, empires and ideological slants changed.
Now, with the Russian invasion, the theatre plans to remove all of its Russian repertoire, at least for the time being.
Tkachenko said the culture ministry is actively lobbying opera houses abroad to remove Russian works from their repertoires, an issue which has stirred a debate in many countries over whether Russia’s cultural heritage should be separate from the actions of Putin’s government.
“We’re trying to argue that in a time of war, it is a symbolic move, and we should find ways to celebrate French, Italian and certainly Ukrainian composers,” said Tkachenko.
Nykolaishyn said she grew up on the Russian classics, and singing Tatyana in Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin was one of her first and favourite soloist roles.
“But right now, this is not the time for anything Russian. Maybe one day it will be possible again, I don’t know,” she said."

Ukraine has suggested that it is willing to resume talks with Russia as Moscow claimed to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol – its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February.
Speaking to a television channel on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that “discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place”.
“Under what format I don’t know – with intermediaries, without them, in a broader group, at the presidential level,” he added. “But the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.
“There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table. We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that.”
The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, responded by blaming Ukraine for stopping the talks. The last discussions between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies.
During the interview, held with a Ukrainian broadcaster, Zelenskiy spoke of creating a document enshrining security guarantees for his country. Although bilateral discussions would be held with Russia, the document would be signed by “friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow”, he added.
However, he warned that the precondition for resuming negotiations was that Moscow did not kill Ukrainian troops who had been defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. “The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,” he said.
Last week, Russia announced it had taken full control of Mariupol, the first major city to fall. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, bringing to an end a months-long siege of the defenders’ last stronghold.
“Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered.
Hours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by commanders that they should leave. In a live video posted on the messaging service Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained.
“The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,” he said. “I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.”
Ukraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.
The fall of Mariupol – the largest trading port on the Sea of Azov, from which Ukraine exports grain, iron, steel and heavy machinery – is a breakthrough for Russia. Taking control of the city means gaining a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea.
Fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas, where Zelenskiy said Russian troops had “completely ruined” the cities of Rubizhne and Volnovakha, “just as they did Mariupol”, adding that the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
Meanwhile, on Saturday the Russian energy company Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership last week.
Moscow had warned Finland that any such application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia, but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of the country’s annual energy consumption.
The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, said he and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had had “open and direct” talks to discuss the bid for Nato membership, after Erdoğan openly questioned whether Finland and Sweden, which has also applied, should be permitted to join."

When Russia invaded Ukraine, I couldn’t eat. And I definitely couldn’t cook for the first month and a half. It was the feeling of guilt. I just felt, “How can I even cook anything when there’s such horror happening everywhere else in Ukraine?” Then, at the first event I did for #CookForUkraine, this woman I’d never met before came up to me and said, “I’ve brought you some broth.” I heated it up at home and had it out of a cup and it was just so life-giving. Then she started sending me a broth every week, and she’s been doing it for two months now. And that’s what I’ve been sustaining myself on.
When I was writing Mamushka, people would say, “Oh, you’re writing a Ukrainian cookbook? Is that about dumplings and potatoes?” I understand it: stereotypes are stereotypes, but hopefully I’ve been able to break some of them. Even when I spoke of Ukraine back then, it was like, “Is that Russia?” No, it’s not fucking Russia! Our culture has for years and years and years been suppressed. Language, food, everything.
I only really realised the scope of my mum and my dad’s skills after I trained to be a chef. Watching Mum make filo pastry, stretching it out with her hands, then spinning it around in the air like a pizzaiolo – it’s like she’s spinning webs. I know loads of professional chefs who would not be able to do that.
Mamushka came out of a big jumble of things that were happening to me in 2014. I lost my job, I was a single mum, my son Sasha was nearly two years old. I was alone in the UK with no job and no prospects. Parallel to that, the Maidan [uprising] happens and the war starts in the Crimea. So it began, actually, as me writing down names of recipes in my notebook as a way of just doing something, and not sitting around and plunging myself into depression. Then I ended up getting this book deal, miraculously, everything came together. I never looked for an agent or to publish, it was just for me.
When I was giving birth to my son, Sasha, my first child, the midwives were like, “Are you OK?” And I was like, “I’m a chef! I’ve done 18-hour shifts at Ottolenghi, I can do this!” And I did. It was a really fast, efficient birth. Working in a busy restaurant kitchen definitely gives you insane stamina, for sure. You learn and your body learns it as well.
The only food I really don’t like is avocado. I don’t get it. I mean, it’s OK in guacamole, when there’s loads of lime juice and flavourings. But avocado on toast? I’d rather eat a shoe.
Coming to the UK to go to university was a shock, to be honest. There had been some attempts at cajoling me into cooking when I was at school by my dad and my mum. But I burned everything. My heart wasn’t in it. Then, because I studied Italian, I did an Erasmus exchange in Italy, and everybody in my halls of residence, especially the boys, weirdly, were incredible cooks. Even if it was very simple, like aglio olio e peperoncino or something, there was just this flair and energy. So I fell in love with the idea of cooking and I just became obsessed.
I’m slowly, slowly getting back into cooking now. I finally convinced my parents to leave the south of Ukraine, which is occupied by Russia. They drove through Europe and eventually ended up in Italy, where my cousin has just recently bought a little house. When they arrived, I made them borscht and handmade Ukrainian-style pasta and a sauce. That was the first time throughout this whole period that I actually enjoyed and was excited about cooking. Yeah, it made me feel good.
FoodMy death-row, apocalypse dish would be my mum’s Ukrainian dumplings called varenyky, which are filled with her homemade cheese that we call syr. It just wires some really crazy things in my brain and makes me release all of the endorphins.
DrinkThe first word that springs to my head is wiiiiine! I really miss Ukrainian wine: natural, low-intervention wine of a kind that is very fashionable now. It would be a dream if I could drink that all summer.
Place to eatFor sure Towpath on the canal in London, also 40 Maltby Street and Rochelle Canteen. You get the gist: restaurants that use really good ingredients and you can feel the skill in cooking, but it’s not fussy.

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/21/canada-announces-sanctions-on-alexander-lebedev-russia-ukraine-report;2022-05-21;UK under pressure over Alexander Lebedev sanctions after Canada move;"Labour says the case for the British government to follow Ottawa’s lead is ‘extremely strong’
The British government is under pressure to impose sanctions on Alexander Lebedev after Canada targeted the former KGB agent in a fresh wave of restrictions against Vladimir Putin’s regime.
The billionaire Russian businessman, who little more than a decade ago bought the UK’s Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, was named in Ottawa’s latest sanctions announced on Friday.
James Emmanuel Wanki, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, confirmed to the Guardian on Saturday that Alexander Yevgenievich Lebedev, born in 1959, is on Canada’s sanctions list against Russia.
The restrictions also included a ban on the import of Russian vodka, diamonds and caviar, according to the Globe and Mail.
A UK government spokesperson said: “This government has been resolute in standing up to Russian aggression. We keep all sanctions under review and they are determined after careful consideration.”
But Labour accused the government of dragging its feet in imposing sanctions on those with links to the Russian president.
The party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “Labour has been clear that anyone with links to the KGB must face sanctions. The Conservatives have been so slow and too soft in issuing sanctions to those with links to Putin.
“There is now an extremely strong case for Alexander Lebedev to face sanctions from the UK and the government must now urgently look at the evidence.”
She accused Boris Johnson of having “form when it comes to protecting the Lebedevs”.
“He failed to release critical information relating to the appointment of Alexander Lebedev’s son to the House of Lords, despite concerns from the security services. This is another case of the prime minister bending the rules to protect his friends,” she said.
Lebedev’s links to Johnson are well documented.
He is also a minority shareholder in the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta. His son Evgeny, who owns the Evening Standard and is a minority shareholder in The Independent, was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 despite concerns raised by MI5.
The government was accused of a cover-up last week after it declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make him a peer, claiming it would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into political point-scoring.
He published a statement in the Standard in February in which he pleaded with Putin to end the war.
The Canadian government said the ban on trade in luxury goods and the addition of 14 oligarchs and Putin associates was aligned with similar measures imposed by allies such as the US and the EU, and would “help to mitigate the potential for Russian oligarchs to circumvent restrictions in other luxury goods markets”.
The sanctions package, announced by Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, covers goods that were worth $75.7m (£47m) in 2021. It also bans the export of jewellery, art and kitchenware to Russia and restricts the export of “goods that could be used in the production and manufacture of weapons”.
“The Putin regime must, and will, answer for their unjustifiable acts,” Joly said. “Canada, together with our allies, will be relentless in our efforts to maintain pressure on the Russian regime until it is no longer able to wage war. We are unwavering in our support for Ukraine and its people.”
According to the Globe and Mail, other figures Canada has newly subjected to sanctions include Gleb Frank, a leading Russian fishery company owner; his father, Sergei Frank, the former minister of transport and former chief executive of Russian shipping firm Sovcomflot; and Sergei Frank’s wife, Ksenia Frank, the daughter of Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch and an associate of Putin.
David Davidovich, a close associate of Roman Abramovich, who has been forced to sell Chelsea football club after being placed under sanctions in the UK, was also sanctioned.
The fresh wave of sanctions came as talks between G7 countries and Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, concluded in Germany.
Canada has to date sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine since the start of Russia’s invasion."

The alarming effects of the global food crisis;"The Bank of England governor warned last week of ‘apocalyptic’ food price rises. Yet war in Ukraine, climate change and inflation are already taking their toll all over the world
Apocalypse is an alarming idea, commonly taken to denote catastrophic destruction foreshadowing the end of the world. But in the original Greek, apokálypsis means a revelation or an uncovering. One vernacular definition is “to take the lid off something”.
That latter feat is exactly what Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, achieved last week, possibly inadvertently, when he suggested Britain was facing “apocalyptic” levels of food price inflation. Tory ministers fumed over what they saw as implied criticism of the government’s masterly economic management.
In fact, Bailey was talking as much about the drastic impact of Ukraine-war-related rises in food costs and food shortages on people in poorer countries. “There’s a major worry for the developing world as well ... Sorry for being apocalyptic for a moment, but that is a major concern,” he said.
With most political and media attention narrowly focused on the emerging UK “cost of living crisis”, Bailey’s high-profile comments were timely – and revelatory. Months of warnings about a global tidal wave of hunger, rendered more urgent by Ukraine, have been largely ignored, not least by Boris Johnson’s aid-cutting government.
The cost of living is a problem in Britain. For UN agencies and humanitarian relief workers around the world, the bigger worry is the cost of dying.
Sounding the alarm again last week, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said Ukraine-related shortages could help “tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity”. The result could be “malnutrition, mass hunger and famine in a crisis that could last for years” – and increase the chances of a global recession.
The World Food Programme estimates about 49 million people face emergency levels of hunger. About 811 million go to bed hungry each night. The number of people on the brink of starvation across Africa’s Sahel region, for example, is at least 10 times higher than in pre-Covid 2019.
The adverse impact of Russia’s invasion on the availability and price of staples such as wheat, maize, barley and sunflower oil – Ukraine and Russia normally produce about 30% of global wheat exports – has been huge.
Ukraine’s wheat production this year is likely to be 35% down, and exporting much of it may be impossible due to Russia’s Black Sea blockade. In March, global commodity prices, recorded by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, hit an all-time high. They remain at record-breaking levels.
Russia’s war has compounded or accelerated pre-existing food deficits and inflationary trends arising from a host of linked factors: the negative economic impact of the pandemic; resulting supply-chain, employment and transport problems; extreme weather and climate-crisis-related falls in output; spiralling energy costs; and numerous other ongoing conflicts worldwide.
Middle-income countries, such as Egypt and Brazil, are exceptionally poorly placed to cope with increased food insecurity, international risk consultants Verisk Maplecroft said in a report last week. Many governments had exhausted their financial and material reserves fighting Covid and incurred large debts.
Now the cupboard is bare. “Unlike low-income countries, they were rich enough to offer social protection during the pandemic, but now struggle to maintain high social spending that is vital to the living standards of large sections of their populations,” the report said.
Argentina, Tunisia, Pakistan and the Philippines, highly dependent on food and energy imports, were among many other middle- or lower-middle-income countries facing an elevated risk of civil unrest by the end of 2022, it suggested.
As the food “apocalypse” approaches, the poorest peoples will suffer, as they always do, while the wealthiest may be insulated, up to a point. But it is feared that the pain will rapidly move up the global food chain. With it is likely to come a surge in political turbulence, humanitarian crises, instability and geo-strategic rivalries across a hungry world.
Scarce food, combined with price increases, electricity blackouts and shortages of petrol, cooking gas and medicines, provoked a political crisis in Sri Lanka this spring that serves as a discomfiting template for countries facing similar problems.
Months of protests culminated in the resignation of the prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, but even his scalp did not prevent unrest turning violent. Desperate, Sri Lanka has been seeking a bridging loan from the World Bank to help pay for essential imports. On Thursday, it defaulted on its debt for the first time ever.
Double-digit inflation that left many Pakistanis unable to afford basic foodstuffs was also a major contributory factor in the fall from power earlier this year of the prime minister, Imran Khan. His attempt to cling to office created a crisis of democracy with which Pakistan is still grappling.
Longer-term factors – repressive governance, corruption, incompetence, polarisation – fuelled unrest in both countries. But dire food shortages and inflation were the catalyst that rendered the objectionable intolerable. That’s a prospect now facing insecure and unpopular regimes from Peru, the Philippines and Cuba to Lebanon and Tunisia.
Analysts compare what is happening today in the Middle East with the Arab spring revolts. Egypt, whose government was overthrown in 2011, is the world’s largest wheat importer. About 70 million people rely on state-subsidised bread. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 80% of Egypt’s grain imports last year.
Today’s high prices and supply shortfalls, especially if they worsen, could do for Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s regime what similar grievances did for his deposed presidential predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.
Another country to watch closely is Iran. Violent protests erupted last week in Khuzestan after the government raised the price of bread, cooking oil and dairy products. Iranians’ situation is made worse by tough US sanctions and a tyrannical, corrupt clerical regime. If living standards continue to fall, there could be an explosion similar to the thwarted nationwide uprising of 2017-18.
In many parts of the world, especially Africa, food insecurity is anything but a new phenomenon. Hunger is the norm and the risk of famine is ever-present, often exacerbated by conflict and climate change. That said, the situation, broadly speaking, is deteriorating.
The total number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent food assistance has nearly doubled since 2016, according to the Global Network Against Food Crises, a joint UN and EU project. And the scale of the challenge is expanding, up by 40 million people, or 20%, last year. The network’s latest report pinpointed countries of particular concern: Ethiopia, South Sudan, southern Madagascar and Yemen, where it said 570,000 people – up 571% on six years ago – were in the most severe or “catastrophe” phase of food insecurity, threatened by the collapse of livelihoods, starvation and death.
Guterres, the UN chief, warned that Vladimir Putin’s war was seriously affecting efforts to fight hunger in Africa. It was imperative, he said, to “bring back the agriculture production of Ukraine and the food and fertiliser production of Russia and Belarus into world markets”. As Russian state media often note, western sanctions have added to global price volatility.
The UN is calling for Ukraine’s blockaded Black Sea and Azov Sea ports to be reopened so that grain exports can resume, not least to African countries. Especially badly affected is the drought-hit Sahel region. “An absolute crisis is unfolding before our eyes,” the World Food Programme’s director, David Beasley, said following visits to Benin, Niger and Chad. “We’re running out of money, and these people are running out of hope.”
That’s partly because aid now costs more. The UN and international agencies are obliged to pay inflated prices, up about 30% from pre-Covid norms, to secure vital food aid. And it is partly because food is more expensive relative to income. An average UK household spends 10% of its income on food. In Kenya or Pakistan, it is over 40%.
Conflict is the biggest driver of hunger, whether it is the depredations of Islamist jihadists in Mali, Nigeria and the southern Philippines, the crass rivalries of regional powers in Yemen and Libya, or an unpardonable full-scale war, as in Ukraine.
The UN estimates that 60% of the world’s hungry live in conflict zones. Ukraine has shown again how war, by causing shortages of essentials and rendering normal life insupportable, leads to internal displacement, aid dependency, refugee emergencies and mass migration.
Syria’s civil war provides a cautionary example – although there are many others. A relatively prosperous country has been reduced by over a decade of conflict to something approaching a basket case. About 12.4 million people – 60% of the population – suffer food insecurity, a figure that has more than doubled since 2019.
Ethiopia’s disastrous war of choice in Tigray, which was invaded by government troops in 2019, is another case of famine following folly. The UN estimated in January that 2 million people were suffering from an extreme lack of food, and were dependent on aid in a province that was previously mostly self-sufficient.
In contrast, South Sudan has never been fully able to feed itself since independence in 2011. Ethnically rooted rivalries have often combined with competition for land and food resources with catastrophic effects. Cattle rustling is a key source of violence, while drought is another big factor.
Even when a struggling country is in the international spotlight – rarely the case with South Sudan – and the war is supposedly over, its fortunes do not necessarily improve. The plight of many Afghans appears to have gone from bad to worse after the 20-year occupation by US and Nato forces ended last year and the Taliban took charge.
The billions of dollars of aid ploughed into the country since 2001 now count for naught. Save the Children said this month that 9.6 million Afghan children are going hungry due to deepening economic woes, Ukraine, and ongoing drought. It is the country’s worst hunger crisis on record, the charity said.
It is no longer controversial to assert that destroyed crops, lost livelihoods and impoverished communities – key micro-ingredients of mass hunger emergencies – are intimately connected to, and affected by, climate change and extreme weather events. But it is still hard to find concerted, effective international action or public pressure to shift the dynamic.
Horn of Africa countries such as Somalia, for example, are experiencing the worst drought in 40 years amid unprecedentedly high temperatures. As Foreign Policy magazine reported recently, when the rains did come, they were extreme and short-lived, causing flooding and breeding swarms of locusts.
It is claimed that about 3 million livestock have perished in southern Ethiopia and semi-arid parts of Kenya since last year. Pointing to climate change, the UN says 20 million people across the region could go hungry this year. Their plight, too, has been exacerbated by Ukraine.
But when the charity Christian Aid commissioned polling on the Horn of Africa region to find out what the British public thought should be done, only 23% of those questioned were aware there was a problem. In contrast, 91% were aware of Putin’s war.
India recently demonstrated the lack of joined-up international thinking on climate, hunger and war. A record-breaking heatwave in north-west India has damaged this year’s crops. That led the government to suspend wheat exports this month. Global markets had been relying on India, the world’s second-largest producer, to make up the Ukraine shortfall. Instead of helping, Narendra Modi’s government did the opposite.
Critical links between the twin crises of climate and hunger are broadly recognised by governments and analysts, but acting to effect real change is proving harder, as the less-than-stellar outcomes of last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow suggest.
In the meantime, the World Bank is throwing money at the problem – at the latest count, $30bn to help low-income countries embroiled in climate and food crises.
When the history of the Ukraine war is written, Russia’s reckless action in weaponising food and deliberately disrupting global supplies, thereby risking the lives of countless millions, may be counted a bigger crime than even its unprovoked attack on its neighbour.
Russia’s role as a key grain and energy exporter is likely to outlive the current regime in Moscow. But its global standing and influence is diminished, probably permanently.
That is largely due to Putin’s personal failure to recognise, or accept, that the era of Soviet exceptionalism is over – and that Russia, like other countries, inhabits a newly interconnected, interdependent, mutually responsible world of rules, rights and laws.
The UN general assembly vote in March, overwhelmingly condemning as illegal Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, brought together many once Moscow-friendly developing countries shocked by Putin’s disregard for national sovereignty and borders – and his apparent indifference to the wellbeing of poorer nations dependent on food and fuel imports. It was a watershed moment.
China’s refusal to condemn the invasion, and its failure to show international leadership in addressing the resulting global hunger and supply crises, may also significantly damage its reputation and, with that, its hopes of hegemony. The contrast presented by the US is striking.
Addressing the UN last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said the world faced “the greatest global food security crisis of our time”. Blinken announced an additional $215m in global emergency food assistance on top of $2.3bn already donated by the US since the Ukraine invasion began on 24 February.
If the looming global “apocalypse” revealed to parliament by Andrew Bailey does indeed materialise this winter, it will be to the US, the UK, their allies and the much-battered UN system – not China, the 21st century’s self-designated superpower – that the world must look for earthly salvation. The challenge ahead is truly biblical.

Ukraine’s president has said the war can only be resolved through diplomacy, despite the current suspension of negotiations.
“Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with a Ukrainian television channel.
“Under what format I don’t know – with intermediaries, without them, in a broader group, at the presidential level. But the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and will only definitively end through diplomacy.”
He added: “There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table. We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that,” he said.
The last talks between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of not wanting to continue talks to end the fighting.
During the interview, Zelenskiy spoke of a document about security guarantees for his country. Although a bilateral discussion would be held with Russia at the same time, the document would be signed by “friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow”, he added.
However, Zelenskiy warned that the precondition for resuming the negotiations with Moscow was that Russia does not kill Ukrainian troops who defended the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
“The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,” he said.
On Friday, Russia claimed to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol – in what has been described as Moscow’s biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February – after the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered. The move marked an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in the city.
“Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered.
Hours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by Ukraine’s military that they could get out and save their lives and would most probably all leave in the coming days.
In a live video posted on Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of the Azov regiment that has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained.
“The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,” he said. “I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.”
Ukraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.
Meanwhile on Saturday, Russia’s Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership.
Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied to join Nato, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption.
On the ground in Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern region of Donbas, where, Zelenskiy said, Russian troops “completely ruined the cities of Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as they did Mariupol”, adding that the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
And while the US Congress this week approved a $40bn (£32bn) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine’s armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system, Moscow claimed on Saturday it had destroyed a large shipment of US and European weapons, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles that allegedly hit Malin railway station, north-west of Kyiv, in the Zhytomyr region.
There was no Ukrainian or independent confirmation as to the success of the strike."
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/21/psychologist-ukrainians-trauma-war-survivors;2022-05-21;As a psychologist helping Ukrainians, I am a witness to the terrible traumas of war;"We can support those trapped in shelters or struggling with survivor’s guilt. But some emotional damage is irreparable
All four of my grandparents survived the second world war, and all four were scarcely willing to talk about it, having either survived the siege of Leningrad or come back from the frontline wounded. On the rare occasions they did, their memories would leave them devastated.
The lifelong PTSD they experienced was quite possibly one of the reasons I became a psychologist. I wanted to do something to end the vicious circle of trauma, abuse, self-neglect and fear. But during my training, I could never have predicted the way I would be applying my skills a decade later.
On 25 February, the day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I volunteered to join several crisis hotlines where psychologists were working to support those affected by the war. I couldn’t stop the war, but at least I might try to lessen the damage. My colleagues come from many different countries – some of the Ukrainian psychologists kept working between bombings, while others had evacuated to a safer place. Quite a few of us, myself included, are living abroad in safety — a privilege too often taken for granted.
During the first weeks of the war, most of the Ukrainian people who texted or called us had either just been evacuated or were still in areas of heavy shelling. Those who managed to escape were suffering from survivor’s guilt, along with shock from the war in general. Those who stayed were experiencing shock in a different way, trying to navigate through their daily spikes of anxiety.
My first client was a person besieged in Ukraine. Their whole family had been hiding in a bomb shelter for days and they were experiencing panic attacks, partly from the sudden responsibility of having to care for elderly relatives and beloved pets. They had to make the kind of decisions no one should have to face.
As the war developed, everyone’s stress tolerance was wearing thinner and thinner. Those who fled Ukraine reported apathy and a loss of the will to live. Old traumas have resurfaced, tightening their grip and making it harder to breathe. Those who were still besieged were getting weaker mentally and physically, and they were finding it harder to cope with the sleep deprivation and constant levels of tension and alertness. In such situations, the main way we can offer support is by validating the person’s feelings; helping them find things they can control; and finding self-regulatory techniques that work, such as body relaxation or breathing techniques.
It became the eerie norm to receive text messages from people who had managed to come online in pauses between hiding in the shelter from bombs. However, none of us could get used to having to guess whether a delay in response meant the person had no network connection, or that they were no longer alive. Messages such as “I feel drained”, “I need an urgent vent call” and “I need to talk to someone, I feel it’s taken a toll on me” started to appear in our internal specialists’ support chats more often.
As a response to this, psychologists who specialise in supervision support started to organise webinars and video conferences in order to help each other work through the tension generated by the sessions. A group of dance movement therapists has recently launched a series of virtual meetups where they show how dance and movement can be used to cope with stress. I find such initiatives very important: if we burn out now, we won’t be able to help.
Messages such as this keep us going: “Thank you for helping me find the strength to let my husband go to war”; “Thank you for this talk, I needed to be heard. I found the courage to try and evacuate, and I’m in a safe place now.”
My grandma – the only grandparent still living – struggles to relive her wartime memories without tears. But she emphasises the importance of truth, especially during the times we’re living in, and of preserving these memories. Lately, my family and I have been spending hours on video calls with her as she shares them with us.
To honour my colleagues’ work I recently started a documentary project, taking their portraits via video calls. It feels important to make a record of this almost invisible part of war. When I publish the project later this year, I hope the war will be over. But a huge volume of trauma repair work is still to be done.

Russia has halted providing natural gas to neighbouring Finland, which has angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership, after the Nordic country refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles.
Gazprom Export has demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but Finland refuses to do so.
“Gas imports through Imatra entry point have been stopped,” Gasgrid Finland said in a statement. Imatra is the entry point for Russian gas into Finland.
Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum on Friday said Gazprom had warned that flows would be halted from 0400 GMT on Saturday morning. Gasum also confirmed on Saturday that the flows had stopped.
“Natural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum’s supply contract have been cut off,” it said in a statement.
“Starting from today, during the upcoming summer season, Gasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline.”Balticconnector links Finland to neighbouring Estonia’s gas grid.
Gazprom Export on Friday said flows would be cut because Gasum had not complied with the new Russian rules requiring settlement in roubles.
The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but gas only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption.
Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied for Nato membership, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow has warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”.
Most European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow already cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms.
Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without.
“The Finnish gas system is in balance both physically and commercially,” Gasgrid said on Saturday.
Finland on Friday said it had agreed to charter a storage and regasification vessel from US based Excelerate Energy to help replace Russian supplies, starting in the fourth quarter this year.
The vessel turns supercooled, liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrives on ships, back into regular gas.

A class of children in Novyi Bykiv sat listening to their teacher, his voice competing with the sound of plastic sheets flapping in the window frames. Asked if they were happy to be back in school, the class of fifth-grade students chorused “Yes!” with genuine enthusiasm.
They may not have windows, electricity or textbooks yet, but lessons in this village east of Kyiv have been back under way for two weeks now, after a major cleanup operation following the departure of the Russian army.
Novyi Bykiv was one of a series of settlements occupied by the Russian army for a month as part of Vladimir Putin’s failed drive towards the capital from three directions. For a month the residents lived in terror, with summary executions and widespread looting part of life.
The school was the main Russian base in the village, and when the Guardian visited just after the Russian departure there were clothes, food and broken glass strewn across the floors, graffiti sprayed on the walls and messages left by the Russians on the blackboards.
The Russians launched BUK missiles from just outside the school, drawing Ukrainian artillery fire that blew out the school’s windows, destroyed much of the Russian hardware and eventually led to their retreat in the last days of March.
“It was an unbearable time; you walked along the street and saw people you knew to be well dressed and elegant and they were wearing rags, with red eyes and looking dazed,” said the headteacher, Natalia Vovk. “Back then I thought that was it, that we’d never been able to work here again, we’d never be able to bring life back to this place,” she said.
For the children, too, the occupation was a traumatic time, as they saw the adults helpless to protect their homes and loved ones from the Russian onslaught.
The cleanup process was long, tiring and unpleasant. One of the downstairs rooms at the school had been used as a hybrid toilet and barbers, and was littered with clumps of hair and piles of faeces. Everywhere there was shattered glass and other debris. Someone found a hand grenade in the basement.
By the beginning of May, enough had been repaired for lessons to resume. In some parts of Ukraine, schools are using distance learning, but the Russian army looted most of the houses in Novyi Bykiv, meaning neither teachers nor students have computers or tablets.
About 100 of the school’s 188 pupils now attend regularly for short school days. Many of the others are still abroad or in western Ukraine, having fled with their families.
A number of small charitable organisations and individuals contacted the school after reading the Guardian article in April detailing the destruction there, Vovk said. Someone sent six computers, which arrived recently by post and are being stored elsewhere until the school building has windows again to ensure they remain safe. Another donor has offered to pay for replacement textbooks, after the entire stock was destroyed in a fire during the occupation.
Locals have also pitched in. Someone donated a lawnmower to mow the grass in front of the building, as the Russians had looted the school’s mower. The school bus driver and the building manager were working on Thursday afternoon to rig up plastic coverings on more of the windows, until the money comes in for permanent replacements.
The war has disrupted schooling across Ukraine, even in the relatively safe western part of the country. More than 200 schools have been fully destroyed and hundreds more damaged, according to Ukraine’s education ombudsman Sergii Gorbachov. Even in the west, in schools with no bomb shelter the lessons have had to go online.
A recent survey of Ukrainian parents found that 75% said their children had shown signs of increased stress since the war started, with some of the most common symptoms being mood swings, nightmares, anxiety and panic attacks.
“Of course children have really suffered during these last months, and it’s really important to give them proper support,” said Yulia Serdyuk, a 35-year-old teacher and psychologist from Novyi Bykiv.
Serdyuk said she advised children to spend as much time as possible talking with their parents and with other children. She said it was important for children to be able to discuss what had happened in the past three months rather than bury the experiences, though in some cases extreme care was required.
“If something terrible happened to their parents then you have to approach these cases really delicately,” she said.
Serdyuk spent three weeks living under occupation in Novyi Bykiv, before deciding to leave with her daughter on 19 March, a terrifying ordeal that involved talking their way through Russian checkpoints and at one point hiding from an incoming artillery strike.
She spent a month in Poland, but as soon as she heard it was safe she returned to Novyi Bykiv. “They took good care of us there but I was so desperate to come back,” she said.
Ukrainian officials hope that eventually the vast majority of children who fled with their families will return. Authorities are in negotiations to allow those abroad to continue some Ukrainian education through distance learning, as well as attending school in the countries where they are temporarily based.
Another issue is the situation in the areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia, where teachers are undergoing “retraining” programmes and are expected to teach in Russian, using the Russian curriculum.
“We have an enormous amount of testimony from the occupied areas about teachers being forced to change curriculums, and in some cases headteachers being kidnapped, or at the very least replaced with other, less qualified people who are willing to collaborate,” Gorbachov said.
In Novyi Bykiv the teachers have done everything to remove signs of the Russian occupation, except in one classroom where they have left the messages scrawled on the blackboard untouched, as a reminder of those days.
“Do not bring shame on the memories of your fathers and grandfathers, they fought AGAINST Nazis,” says one message in chalk, echoing the distorted Russian propaganda narrative that the Russian mission in Ukraine is about “denazification”.
Vovk, whose mother is Russian and moved to Ukraine 40 years ago, said it was hard for her to understand the mentality of those Russians who had come to the village. She has long stopped speaking to her own family members in Russia.
“It’s just unthinkable what happened, how they could do this,” she said. “We all just hope our victory will come as soon as possible, and that they never come back here again.”"

Russia has taken control of the Azovstal steel plant, the country’s defence ministry said on Friday evening. Ukrainian soldiers had finally ended their defence of the site in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, he said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Ukrainian combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one called for their execution.
Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, Luhansk, as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. “They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as Mariupol,” he said in a video address late on Friday, adding the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”.
Twelve people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling in Severodonetsk, the regional governor said. Troops fired on a school in the eastern city,  killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, said the head of the Luhansk regional state administration, Serhiy Haidai.
At least seven people, including a child, have been injured in a Russian missile attack on the town of Lozova in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The missile had targeted “the newly renovated House of Culture” in Lozova, Zelenskiy said in a statement on social media.
Zelenskiy proposed a formal deal with the country’s allies to secure Russian compensation for damage its forces have caused during the war. Zelenskiy, who says Russia is trying to destroy as much of Ukraine’s infrastructure as it can, said such a deal would show nations planning aggressive acts that they would have to pay for their actions. “We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred,” he said in a video address on Friday.
G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion.

Moody’s on Friday cut Ukraine’s debt rating for the second time in three months and lowered the outlook to negative due to the growing risk the Russian invasion will affect the nation’s debt sustainability. The US Congress on Thursday approved a $40bn aid package for Ukraine to help fight Russia and keep the government operating, adding to aid packages and loans from the IMF and World Bank. Zelenskiy said his government needs $7bn a month to keep its economy afloat, while Moody’s estimates Ukraine faces financing needs of around $50bn this year.
A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces.

Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.”
Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, starting from Saturday. The Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Gasum said the taps would be turned off when its contract with Gazprom ended at 7am (0400 GMT). The move, which Russia has blamed on Finland’s refusal to pay in rubles, comes days after Finland and Sweden submitted a joint application for Nato membership.

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has disclosed that the UK has begun discussions with its international allies about sending modern weaponry to Moldova to protect it from Russia.
She said that she wants to see the country, which is to the south-west of Ukraine, “equipped to Nato standard.”
Moldova is not currently a Nato member and there are concerns that it could be a future target for Vladimir Putin after the Ukraine conflict.
In an interview with the Telegraph, Truss said: “I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard. This is a discussion we’re having with our allies.
“Putin has been absolutely clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia – and just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren’t successful it doesn’t mean he’s abandoned those ambitions.”
The UK, US, France and Germany have held talks about whether to sign a form of security guarantee for Ukraine to continue providing weaponry and support in the long term.
Truss added: “What we’re working on at the moment is a joint commission with Ukraine and Poland on upgrading Ukrainian defences to Nato standard. So we will scope out what that looks like, what the Ukrainians need. The question then is how do you maintain that over time?
“How do we ensure … that Ukraine is permanently able to defend itself and how do we guarantee that happens? That’s what we are working on at the moment.
“And that also applies to other vulnerable states such as Moldova. Because again, the threat is broader from Russia, we also need to make sure that they are equipped to Nato standards.”
Last month Moldova’s deputy prime minister warned that the country was facing “a very dangerous new moment” and said forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the break-away region of Transnistria.
Nicu Popescu said his government had seen “a dangerous deterioration of the situation” after grenade attacks on the “ministry of security” in the region. The attacks represented “a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region”, he said, adding that Moldova’s institutions had been put on high alert in response.
Fears are growing that Moldova and Transnistria could be drawn into the Ukraine conflict. The predominantly Russian-speaking region in eastern Moldova has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992 after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels.
Speaking before the attacks, a senior Russian commander said gaining control over southern Ukraine would help Russia link up with Transnistria, which shares a 453km (280-mile) border with Ukraine.
